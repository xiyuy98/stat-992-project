d420095ebc8c1402f19ea4943f7b4cd62b03aea9,SynQuant: An Automatic Tool to Quantify Synapses from Microscopy Images,"Motivation Synapses are essential to neural signal transmission. Therefore, quantification of synapses and related neurites from images is vital to gain insights into the underlying pathways of brain functionality and diseases. Despite the wide availability of synaptic punctum imaging data, several issues are impeding satisfactory quantification of these structures by current tools. First, the antibodies used for labeling synapses are not perfectly specific to synapses. These antibodies may exist in neurites or other cell compartments. Second, the brightness for different neurites and synaptic puncta is heterogeneous due to the variation of antibody concentration and synapse-intrinsic differences. Third, images often have low signal to noise ratio due to constraints of experiment facilities and availability of sensitive antibodies. These issues make the detection of synapses challenging and necessitates developing a new tool to easily and accurately quantify synapses. Results We present an automatic probability-principled synapse detection algorithm and integrate it into our synapse quantification tool SynQuant. Derived from the theory of order statistics, our method controls the false discovery rate and improves the power of detecting synapses. SynQuant is unsupervised, works for both 2D and 3D data, and can handle multiple staining channels. Through extensive experiments on one synthetic and three real data sets with ground truth annotation or manual labeling, SynQuant was demonstrated to outperform peer specialized synapse detection tools as well as generic spot detection methods, including 4 unsupervised and 11 variants of 3 supervised methods.

9456e1dac6eec17ff404363895cbef6b95120db2,Bayesian modeling of ChIP-chip data through a high-order Ising model.,"ChIP-chip experiments are procedures that combine chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and DNA microarray (chip) technology to study a variety of biological problems, including protein-DNA interaction, histone modification, and DNA methylation. The most important feature of ChIP-chip data is that the intensity measurements of probes are spatially correlated because the DNA fragments are hybridized to neighboring probes in the experiments. We propose a simple, but powerful Bayesian hierarchical approach to ChIP-chip data through an Ising model with high-order interactions. The proposed method naturally takes into account the intrinsic spatial structure of the data and can be used to analyze data from multiple platforms with different genomic resolutions. The model parameters are estimated using the Gibbs sampler. The proposed method is illustrated using two publicly available data sets from Affymetrix and Agilent platforms, and compared with three alternative Bayesian methods, namely, Bayesian hierarchical model, hierarchical gamma mixture model, and Tilemap hidden Markov model. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method performs as well as the other three methods for the data from Affymetrix tiling arrays, but significantly outperforms the other three methods for the data from Agilent promoter arrays. In addition, we find that the proposed method has better operating characteristics in terms of sensitivities and false discovery rates under various scenarios.",2010,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qianxing Mo"", ids = ""50453243""); list(name = ""Faming Liang"", ids = ""47310716"")",99cb7730382efe7e4028b8bcb1e704d42c6d0f30; 1e50657c10c75dbf6a96e99e2c828d6427a6c802; 992a40a1fc33a6ba60283506a183de3d16fd17b0; 53c2a2f1a2738f18dc4527d3c4497e5df4499ee9; 4467fd503df0580d15639f64376d56d102d7a0a7,,Biometrics,66 4,"

4ee99461ba65c04d6f74efc27e2f22cd45e37e86,Multiple Testing of Local Maxima for Detection of Peaks in Random Fields.,"A topological multiple testing scheme is presented for detecting peaks in images under stationary ergodic Gaussian noise, where tests are performed at local maxima of the smoothed observed signals. The procedure generalizes the one-dimensional scheme of [31] to Euclidean domains of arbitrary dimension. Two methods are developed according to two different ways of computing p-values: (i) using the exact distribution of the height of local maxima, available explicitly when the noise field is isotropic [9, 10]; (ii) using an approximation to the overshoot distribution of local maxima above a pre-threshold, applicable when the exact distribution is unknown, such as when the stationary noise field is non-isotropic [9]. The algorithms, combined with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for thresholding p-values, provide asymptotic strong control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and power consistency, with specific rates, as the search space and signal strength get large. The optimal smoothing bandwidth and optimal pre-threshold are obtained to achieve maximum power. Simulations show that FDR levels are maintained in non-asymptotic conditions. The methods are illustrated in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance images of the brain.",2017,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Dan Cheng"", ids = ""47061276""); list(name = ""Armin Schwartzman"", ids = ""46675540"")",036cb6bebc67c65857e927240366245c4700189a; cf2bc21f2eff5d7399043f9fec91e1727e85702b; 5015cb4096bb8d52144490a730f99f219e6c8fb4; e1bbffda6c897ee0b2030599060e791d57dc3ec1; 7079be3181a4f0a9ff54f7fc0c3425fe15164ddb; 364271203b7bc65bfcf762bd2454c08e559413b0; 116daec185ea0ab683bf358036c51789431b0922; aff0dd55d190037dcdbdaa5a1dda28c2f2f4733a; 4d55b0a22459530c3d6b85c9a5c9831cd128c085; 77ab9eb9e9ef26e6477c7ecb818301dcbad9bfd9; 4aedfe55933a8e1e5c7a1a575c3e5c08c60e823e; c9b7b501b3235e5c2a6702bc58f37e4528de8022; c8f280624a54588532710d49338792ee546acff3,aa592f0dca2a00f7c66bf657818f0779a733691b; c09fa9d9c39657a7a236dfe9b080695c1c2f4d03; a099e74bcfc047a1cff5a0e18b9585aaed0ce7ff; 365a9053e8281186f83785744de34f2aad84ba76; 68f57231cf3fec29ca6b9550c3bdc250117325fe; 11a98994efbc59ebd299faaa91b6c02d2f386129; 1e286fd1e4aa025defb378fa75bb8b1458d377f5; 6bc3395de79df20869dea7d9eb3febfec5e04aa6; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; e6e923564f8ae8450977ebc7c333e9f0bf8bf710; 88949bc209438780fe2b8df0655109d2a8d8159c; 48caa22bd6d406d5826be014b031093c112d853b; baf6d13a022bd776d9e6099d80e704e5e6654306; 85fb198635415207241fafc25fe90c011f18e1c3; a2404efe53398d7900830f1c25bdecf42bf1002e; c7980dbe0470e041ed17da22250f15fb35f3e73d; 376a3954ab58bf8539d38f13407a1a0a4adbb995; 38712dfb830c5594802cccff4dc3d39ce6678f5d; 97e87a444ff1c5be4dc3dddcb7208112bbcc7534; 70fb2b55796680f32e8bff6b85e1fbe6c6b8feaf; 030e3cf00f24be0b5b6b05a42bb64aca8f7fe006; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f8342f184985f75b8f903ee45b2d4d87a9469789; 493fb60f449846b4b6a38fb951e989d75dc64593; e8787b7d5b931fa1091ba769f4147e3ba65c3d12; e4e4d3fb2bdc62e3a09060253d37f8bcbf346689; 71151b0961ba4d5958e2eeda524115b5d3757f9d,Annals of statistics,45 2,"

f039d81c44c5e3177c5ea2480c944d319db67145,Association of a polymorphism of ROR 2 and ischemic stroke in Japanese individuals with chronic kidney disease,"Although chronic kidney disease (CKD) is recognized as an important risk factor for ischemic stroke, genetic factors underlying predisposition to ischemic stroke in individuals with or without CKD remain largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to ischemic stroke in individuals with or without CKD in order to allow prediction of genetic risk for such individuals separately. The study population comprised 974 individuals with CKD, including 227 subjects with ischemic stroke and 747 controls, and 3,470 individuals without CKD, including 612 subjects with ischemic stroke and 2,858 controls. The 150 polymorphisms examined in the present study were selected by genome-wide association studies of ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction with the use of the GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set (Affymetrix). In individuals with CKD, an initial Chi-square test revealed that the Aâ†’G polymorphism (rs10992119) of the receptor tyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor 2 gene (ROR2) was significantly (false discovery rate for allele frequency, 0.0478) associated with ischemic stroke. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates revealed that the Aâ†’G polymorphism of ROR2 was significantly (P=0.0100) associated with ischemic stroke (recessive model; odds ratio 1.57; 95% CI 1.12-2.23), with the G allele representing a risk factor for this condition. A stepwise forward selection procedure demonstrated that this polymorphism was a significant (P=0.0095) and independent determinant of ischemic stroke. In individuals without CKD, no polymorphism was significantly related to ischemic stroke. Genotyping for ROR2 may prove informative for assessment of the genetic risk for ischemic stroke in Japanese individuals with CKD. Determination of the genotype for this polymorphism may prove informative for assessment of the genetic risk for ischemic stroke in such individuals.",2010,,"list(name = ""Mitsutoshi Oguri"", ids = ""5005355""); list(name = ""Takanori Nagahiro"", ids = ""39186883""); list(name = ""Haruo Kamiya"", ids = ""51903911""); list(name = ""Miyoshi Ohno"", ids = ""3600314""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Kiyoshi Yokoi"", ids = ""2332668""); list(name = ""Tetsuro Yoshida"", ids = ""9796442""); list(name = ""Sachiro Watanabe"", ids = ""66974556""); list(name = ""Norifumi Metoki"", ids = ""6157218""); list(name = ""Hidemi Yoshida"", ids = ""153124940""); list(name = ""Kei Satoh"", ids = ""49245021""); list(name = ""Yukitoshi Aoyagi"", ids = ""5446851""); list(name = ""Yoshinori Nozawa"", ids = ""3526189""); list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711"")",e6d0eadbf28ff5906f69b249ca183722b780b6b7,26490d36ddf87e9eccf37f25bc943c61b1474beb; 14f4dbfa57cb774df163c077af34d51be99ee29b; ab8fbdf4d32022fa19fae6145a7b43991794777a; 17d19d3f057831a5da643e8a552f070a6da223ef; fc11dbf133dcc33bc6be8e3814c8d80a4cb52906; caf06b90fb03e669a3791edeed2863c2b72c4214; d854a6d78bbd216ca7ad11eb80997079f2bc7dc0; ae1074febb29f577816ea000fdff796dd149227d; 34e4bf813b78328a79898d5bd971419f6d4b724e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 910b44f6554a2b2e0d621dd1fb4c99ab35d397e1; 4b669b0394c7408b79ec0198822554cd5c6a9ae0; fbcb91c2f32ca009f61d200c53148a178c2096ad; 2df4c177661484264104ca8fac420fe4ac9cea20; d1db4d8384474492d368407de59dcf56af73d256; c5c2a0bef5c257f18ee7c69d77872dc551f8ed18; ba8223bc08ef6c46bdf16e523e8968f4ef7f6a8a; e5f8249e5f1d1710c36f685b3135fbfc40fe5556; 92cb1b0fec367a5373d6213eedde17a9f683502e; a0d2b81428f8d7acdde59634241eb38d37b257d8; 597dce7708aa6dfebd62345b0a1db996295ddb57; 05838fcb5c268c60f84431ef8d301a3a71464f88; 40988f0f24aafa8602f23d868d745b1cd87343ad; 96819cd0019c753fe4bf938b5f39258e63f34ea1; 49c05654cce37426aa0b3adc1157ad4e05f854bd; 29355a34123d8a30020851570c1853573e4952d5; 5106cb68492dca184604f674e0535eaf75040a92; a1af882318cfd9af31a3cbdbd6ab588c7c47c466; 258d0052851edfd6a7425555ab4d7acaf6afd57f; 4ad306d1e1847547fae979b4fac6e014aa652216,,,

Scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SCARB1) plays an important role in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) metabolism in selective cholesteryl ester uptake and in free cholesterol cellular efflux.


METHODS AND RESULTS
This study aims to identify common (minor allele frequency â‰¥5%) and low-frequency/rare (minor allele frequency <5%) variants, using resequencing all 13 exons and exon-intron boundaries of SCARB1 in 95 individuals with extreme HDL-C levels selected from a population-based sample of 623 US non-Hispanic whites. The sequencing step identified 44 variants, of which 11 were novel with minor allele frequency <1%. Seventy-six variants (40 sequence variants, 32 common HapMap tag single nucleotide polymorphisms, and 4 relevant variants) were selected for genotyping in the total sample of 623 subjects followed by association analyses with lipid traits. Seven variants were nominally associated with apolipoprotein B (apoB; n=4) or HDL-C (n=3; P<0.05). Three variants associated with apoB remained significant after controlling false discovery rate. The most significant association was observed between rs4765615 and apoB (P=0.0059), while rs11057844 showed the strongest association with HDL-C (P=0.0035). A set of 17 rare variants (minor allele frequency â‰¤1%) showed significant association with apoB (P=0.0284). Haplotype analysis revealed 4 regions significantly associated with either apoB or HDL-C.

Our findings provide new information about the genetic role of SCARB1 in affecting plasma apoB levels in addition to its established role in HDL-C metabolism.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Vipavee Niemsiri"", ids = ""5104019""); list(name = ""Xingbin Wang"", ids = ""2381547""); list(name = ""Dilek Pirim"", ids = ""5799731""); list(name = ""Zaheda H.

679e7a2dd685ab7ebb3728c15a87896577d2c6b5,Global analysis of protein palmitoylation in African trypanosomes.,"Many eukaryotic proteins are posttranslationally modified by the esterification of cysteine thiols to long-chain fatty acids. This modification, protein palmitoylation, is catalyzed by a large family of palmitoyl acyltransferases that share an Asp-His-His-Cys Cys-rich domain but differ in their subcellular localizations and substrate specificities. In Trypanosoma brucei, the flagellated protozoan parasite that causes African sleeping sickness, protein palmitoylation has been observed for a few proteins, but the extent and consequences of this modification are largely unknown. We undertook the present study to investigate T. brucei protein palmitoylation at both the enzyme and substrate levels. Treatment of parasites with an inhibitor of total protein palmitoylation caused potent growth inhibition, yet there was no effect on growth by the separate, selective inhibition of each of the 12 individual T. brucei palmitoyl acyltransferases. This suggested either that T. brucei evolved functional redundancy for the palmitoylation of essential palmitoyl proteins or that palmitoylation of some proteins is catalyzed by a noncanonical transferase. To identify the palmitoylated proteins in T. brucei, we performed acyl biotin exchange chemistry on parasite lysates, followed by streptavidin chromatography, two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry protein identification, and QSpec statistical analysis. A total of 124 palmitoylated proteins were identified, with an estimated false discovery rate of 1.0%. This palmitoyl proteome includes all of the known palmitoyl proteins in procyclic-stage T. brucei as well as several proteins whose homologues are palmitoylated in other organisms. Their sequences demonstrate the variety of substrate motifs that support palmitoylation, and their identities illustrate the range of cellular processes affected by palmitoylation in these important pathogens.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Brian T.

1abc4aeeced22dfe6066ec419e56b2b27e222277,A biological question and a balanced (orthogonal) design: the ingredients to efficiently analyze two-color microarrays with Confirmatory Factor Analysis,"BackgroundFactor analysis (FA) has been widely applied in microarray studies as a data-reduction-tool without any a-priori assumption regarding associations between observed data and latent structure (Exploratory Factor Analysis).A disadvantage is that the representation of data in a reduced set of dimensions can be difficult to interpret, as biological contrasts do not necessarily coincide with single dimensions. However, FA can also be applied as an instrument to confirm what is expected on the basis of pre-established hypotheses (Confirmatory Factor Analysis, CFA). We show that with a hypothesis incorporated in a balanced (orthogonal) design, including 'SelfSelf' hybridizations, dye swaps and independent replications, FA can be used to identify the latent factors underlying the correlation structure among the observed two-color microarray data. An orthogonal design will reflect the principal components associated with each experimental factor. We applied CFA to a microarray study performed to investigate cisplatin resistance in four ovarian cancer cell lines, which only differ in their degree of cisplatin resistance.ResultsTwo latent factors, coinciding with principal components, representing the differences in cisplatin resistance between the four ovarian cancer cell lines were easily identified. From these two factors 315 genes associated with cisplatin resistance were selected, 199 genes from the first factor (False Discovery Rate (FDR): 19%) and 152 (FDR: 24%) from the second factor, while both gene sets shared 36. The differential expression of 16 genes was validated with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.ConclusionOur results show that FA is an efficient method to analyze two-color microarray data provided that there is a pre-defined hypothesis reflected in an orthogonal design.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anne P G Crijns"", ids = ""81810797""); list(name = ""Frans Gerbens"", ids = ""6343211""); list(name = ""A.

96a4f2bac8d3b53c5658cf628ffd6f13b26ed2a2,A novel filter feature selection method for paired microarray expression data analysis,"In recent years, a large amount of microarray data sets are produced with tens of thousands of genes. Feature selection has become a very sharp tool to select the informative genes. However, few feature selection methods consider the effect of paired samples, which are much more considered in the experiments of these years. Here, we propose a new feature selection method for paired microarray data sets analysis. It uses the fold change instead of the subtraction in the original approach, measures the statistical significant using the q-value of False Discovery Rate (FDR) and also decreases the influence of redundant genes. We compare the proposed method with another six existing methods in predict performance, stability of gene lists, functional stability and functional enrichment analysis using six kinds of paired cancer data sets. Comparison results show that our proposed method achieves better effectiveness, stability and consistency when it is applied to paired data sets.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhongbo Cao"", ids = ""1859124""); list(name = ""Yan Wang"", ids = ""37406256""); list(name = ""Ying Sun"", ids = ""1707882""); list(name = ""Wei Du"", ids = ""145553884""); list(name = ""Yanchun Liang"", ids = ""1694025"")",9b8b973ed9ff1866680ecbf44e307355b9063f4c; 16f87563caaa10d88a1daffab572d439697ea5d3,,International journal of data mining and bioinformatics,12 4,"

171a45faf2b93911177cfa0b2e0ed9c2ef90bf2c,Effects of a genome-wide supported psychosis risk variant on neural activation during a theory-of-mind task,"Schizophrenia is associated with marked deficits in theory of mind (ToM), a higher-order form of social cognition representing the thoughts, emotions and intentions of others. Altered brain activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and temporo-parietal cortex during ToM tasks has been found in patients with schizophrenia, but the relevance of these neuroimaging findings for the heritable risk for schizophrenia is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that activation of the ToM network is altered in healthy risk allele carriers of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1344706 in the gene ZNF804A, a recently discovered risk variant for psychosis with genome-wide support. In all, 109 healthy volunteers of both sexes in Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium for rs1344706 were investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging during a ToM task. As hypothesised, risk carriers exhibited a significant (P<0.05 false discovery rate, corrected for multiple comparisons) risk allele dose effect on neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and left temporo-parietal cortex. Moreover, the same effect was found in the left inferior parietal cortex and left inferior frontal cortex, which are part of the human analogue of the mirror neuron system. In addition, in an exploratory analysis (P<0.001 uncorrected), we found evidence for aberrant functional connectivity between the frontal and temporo-parietal regions in risk allele carriers. To conclude, we show that a dysfunction of the ToM network is associated with a genome-wide supported genetic risk variant for schizophrenia and has promise as an intermediate phenotype that can be mined for the development of biological interventions targeted to social dysfunction in psychiatry.",2011,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Henrik Walter"", ids = ""144278023""); list(name = ""Knut Schnell"", ids = ""1750637""); list(name = ""Susanne Erk"", ids = ""2716428""); list(name = ""Claudia Arnold"", ids = ""143685017""); list(name = ""Peter Kirsch"", ids = ""144890633""); list(name = ""Christine Esslinger"", ids = ""3256137""); list(name = ""Daniela Mier"", ids = ""2136546""); list(name = ""Mike M Schmitgen"", ids = ""3411220""); list(name = ""Marcella Rietschel"", ids = ""3100404""); list(name = ""Stephanie H.

The majority of HF patients suffer from either ischemic (ICM) or dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathy. Little is known about the genetic alterations in DCM or ICM patients. Therefore, our aim was to characterize differentially expressed genes in left ventricular tissue from DCM and ICM patients. Methods Left ventricular tissue of patients with end-stage HF due to ICM (n=6) or DCM (n=7) was collected during implantation of a ventricular assist device (LVAD). Myocardial tissue from patients with septal myectomy during aortic valve surgery (n=6) served as control. Specimens were collected and immediately quick frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was purified and quality checked, whereafter PolyA-RNA-Sequencing was performed. For each sample, âˆ¼30 million reads were obtained. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using a false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤ 0.1 and log2 count per million (logCPM) â‰¥ 1. The commercial Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity ) software was used to determine significantly affected pathways and molecular networks. Results RNA-sequencing revealed 300 differentially expressed genes in DCM vs. control patients, 508 genes in ICM vs. control patients, and 28 genes in DCM vs. ICM patients. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showed alterations of different pathways in DCM vs. ICM patients, with many downregulated pathways in DCM patients and many upregulated pathways in ICM patients. Conclusion The present data suggest that different genes and pathways are involved in the underlying pathomechanisms of ICM and DCM. Further research in this field is needed and could reveal potential new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Fabian Emrich"", ids = ""77211784""); list(name = ""Yaron D.

98cb79d9f6ae0757ffb8517c802813db97ae678e,Controlling the False Discovery Rate: A New Application to Account for Multiple and Dependent Tests in Local Statistics of Spatial Association,"Assessing the significance of multiple and dependent comparisons is an important, and often ignored, issue that becomes more critical as the size of data sets increases. If not accounted for, false-positive differences are very likely to be identified. The need to address this issue has led to the development of a myriad of procedures to account for multiple testing. The simplest and most widely used technique is the Bonferroni method, which controls the probability that a true null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected. However, it is a very conservative procedure. As a result, the larger the data set the greater the chances that truly significant differences will be missed. In 1995, a new criterion, the false discovery rate (FDR), was proposed to control the proportion of false declarations of significance among those individual deviations from null hypotheses considered to be significant. It is more powerful than all previously proposed methods. Multiple and dependent comparisons are also fundamental in spatial analysis. As the number of locations increases, assessing the significance of local statistics of spatial association becomes a complex matter. In this article we use empirical and simulated data to evaluate the use of the FDR approach in appraising the occurrence of clusters detected by local indicators of spatial association. Results show a significant gain in identification of meaningful clusters when controlling the FDR, in comparison to more conservative approaches. When no control is adopted, false clusters are likely to be identified. If a conservative approach is used, clusters are only partially identified and true clusters are largely missed.

6150801e4a272197021161d369d63436a6aa7655,"An easy-to-use Decoy Database Builder software tool, implementing different decoy strategies for false discovery rate calculation in automated MS/MS protein identifications.","One of the major challenges for large scale proteomics research is the quality evaluation of results. Protein identification from complex biological samples or experimental setups is often a manual and subjective task which lacks profound statistical evaluation. This is not feasible for high-throughput proteomic experiments which result in large datasets of thousands of peptides and proteins and their corresponding mass spectra. To improve the quality, reliability and comparability of scientific results, an estimation of the rate of erroneously identified proteins is advisable. Moreover, scientific journals increasingly stipulate that articles containing considerable MS data should be subject to stringent statistical evaluation. We present a newly developed easy-to-use software tool enabling quality evaluation by generating composite target-decoy databases usable with all relevant protein search engines. This tool, when used in conjunction with relevant statistical quality criteria, enables to reliably determine peptides and proteins of high quality, even for nonexperienced users (e.g. laboratory staff, researchers without programming knowledge). Different strategies for building decoy databases are implemented and the resulting databases are characterized and compared. The quality of protein identification in high-throughput proteomics is usually measured by the false positive rate (FPR), but it is shown that the false discovery rate (FDR) delivers a more meaningful, robust and comparable value.",2008,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Kai A.

c22c7653a853632b1f1250ca23fdf13c49006494,Power and type I error rate of false discovery rate approaches in genome-wide association studies,"In genome-wide genetic studies with a large number of markers, balancing the type I error rate and power is a challenging issue. Recently proposed false discovery rate (FDR) approaches are promising solutions to this problem. Using the 100 simulated datasets of a genome-wide marker map spaced about 3 cM and phenotypes from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 14, we studied the type I error rate and power of Storey's FDR approach, and compared it to the traditional Bonferroni procedure. We confirmed that Storey's FDR approach had a strong control of FDR. We found that Storey's FDR approach only provided weak control of family-wise error rate (FWER). For these simulated datasets, Storey's FDR approach only had slightly higher power than the Bonferroni procedure. In conclusion, Storey's FDR approach is more powerful than the Bonferroni procedure if strong control of FDR or weak control of FWER is desired. Storey's FDR approach has little power advantage over the Bonferroni procedure if there is low linkage disequilibrium among the markers. Further evaluation of the type I error rate and power of the FDR approaches for higher linkage disequilibrium and for haplotype analyses is warranted.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qiong Yang"", ids = ""144113504""); list(name = ""Jing Cui"", ids = ""143805961""); list(name = ""Irmarie Chazaro"", ids = ""4358393""); list(name = ""L.

Within each group, gene expression was compared between 6 months and baseline with cutoffs at nominal p â‰¤ .01 and absolute fold-change â‰¥ 1.5. Gene-set enrichment analysis (false discovery rate < 5%) was used to identify significantly regulated biological pathways. CR and CREX elicited similar overall clinical response to energy deficit and a comparable reduction in gene transcription specific to oxidative phosphorylation and proteasome function. CR vastly outweighed CREX in the number of differentially regulated genes (88 vs 39) and pathways (28 vs 6). CR specifically downregulated the chemokine signaling-related pathways. Among the CR-regulated genes, 27 functioned as transcription/translation regulators (eg, mRNA processing or transcription/translation initiation), whereas CREX regulated only one gene in this category. Our data suggest that CR has a broader effect on the transcriptome compared with CREX which may mediate its specific impact on delaying primary aging.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Y. Y.

fa9c4d4b7a2a11f2afb236c1d5120be4bf350b7c,Prenatal lead exposure is associated with decreased cord blood DNA methylation of the glycoprotein VI gene involved in platelet activation and thrombus formation,"Early-life lead exposure impairs neurodevelopment and later exposure affects the cardiovascular system. Lead has been associated with reduced global 5-methylcytosine DNA methylation, suggesting that lead toxicity acts through epigenetic mechanisms. The objective of this study is to clarify how early-life lead exposure alters DNA methylation of specific genes, using an epigenomic approach. We measured lead concentrations in urine [gestational week (GW), 8] and erythrocytes (GW 14), using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, for 127 pregnant mothers recruited in the MINIMat food and supplementation cohort in rural Bangladesh. Cord blood DNA methylation was analyzed with the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip, and top sites were validated by methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt curve analysis. Maternal urinary lead concentrations (divided into quartiles) showed significant (after adjustment for false discovery rate) inverse associations with methylation at nine CpGs. Three of these sites were in the 5'-end, including the promoter, of glycoprotein IV (GP6); cg18355337 (qâ€‰=â€‰0.029, Î²â€‰=â€‰-0.30), cg25818583 (qâ€‰=â€‰0.041, Î²â€‰=â€‰-0.18), and cg23796967 (qâ€‰=â€‰0.047, Î²â€‰=â€‰-0.17). The methylation in another CpG site in GP6 was close to significant (cg05374025, qâ€‰=â€‰0.057, Î²â€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.23). The erythrocyte lead concentrations (divided into quartiles) were also inversely associated with CpG methylation in GP6, although this was not statistically significant after false discovery rate adjustments. Eight CpG sites in GP6 constituted a differentially methylated region in relation to urinary lead (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.005, qâ€‰=â€‰0.48) and erythrocyte lead (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.007, qâ€‰=â€‰0.46). In conclusion, we found that moderate prenatal lead exposure appears to epigenetically affect GP6, a key component of platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, suggesting a novel link between early lead exposure and cardiovascular disease later in life.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Karin SchlÃ¤wicke EngstrÃ¶m"", ids = ""3073597""); list(name = ""Filip Rydbeck"", ids = ""4845398""); list(name = ""Maria J Kippler"", ids = ""4303901""); list(name = ""Tomasz K.

70c8bdce557fa08c89c98505bb545fc02d972885,Comprehensive analysis of the long noncoding RNA HOXA11-AS gene interaction regulatory network in NSCLC cells,"BackgroundLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are related to different biological processes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of the long noncoding RNA HOXA11-AS (HOXA11 antisense RNA) in NSCLC are unknown.MethodsHOXA11-AS was knocked down in the NSCLC A549 cell line and a high throughput microarray assay was applied to detect changes in the gene profiles of the A549 cells. Bioinformatics analyses (gene ontology (GO), pathway, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and network analyses) were performed to investigate the potential pathways and networks of the differentially expressed genes. The molecular signatures database (MSigDB) was used to display the expression profiles of these differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, the relationships between the HOXA11-AS, de-regulated genes and clinical NSCLC parameters were verified by using NSCLC patient information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In addition, the relationship between HOXA11-AS expression and clinical diagnostic value was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.ResultsAmong the differentially expressed genes, 277 and 80 genes were upregulated and downregulated in NSCLC, respectively (fold changeÂ â‰¥2.0, PÂ <Â 0.05 and false discovery rate (FDR)Â <Â 0.05). According to the degree of the fold change, six upregulated and three downregulated genes were selected for further investigation. Only four genes (RSPO3, ADAMTS8, DMBT1, and DOCK8) were reported to be related with the development or progression of NSCLC based on a PubMed search. Among all possible pathways, three pathways (the PI3K-Akt, TGF-beta and Hippo signaling pathways) were the most likely to be involved in NSCLC development and progression. Furthermore, we found that HOXA11-AS was highly expressed in both lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma based on TCGA database. The ROC curve showed that the area under curve (AUC) of HOXA11-AS was 0.727 (95% CI 0.663â€“0.790) for lung adenocarcinoma and 0.933 (95% CI 0.906â€“0.960) for squamous cell carcinoma patients. Additionally, the original data from TCGA verified that ADAMTS8, DMBT1 and DOCK8 were downregulated in both lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, whereas RSPO3 expression was upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma and downregulated in lung squamous cell carcinoma. For the other five genes (STMN2, SPINK6, TUSC3, LOC100128054, and C8orf22), we found that STMN2, TUSC3 and C8orf22 were upregulated in squamous cell carcinoma and that STMN2 and USC3 were upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, we compared the correlation between HOXA11-AS and de-regulated genes in NSCLC based on TCGA. The results showed that the HOXA11-AS expression was negatively correlated with DOCK8 in squamous cell carcinoma (rÂ =Â âˆ’0.124, PÂ =Â 0.048) and lung adenocarcinoma (rÂ =Â âˆ’0.176, PÂ =Â 0.005). In addition, RSPO3, ADAMTS8 and DOCK8 were related to overall survival and disease-free survival (all PÂ <Â 0.05) of lung adenocarcinoma patients in TCGA.ConclusionsOur results showed that the gene profiles were significantly changed after HOXA11-AS knock-down in NSCLC cells. We speculated that HOXA11-AS may play an important role in NSCLC development and progression by regulating the expression of various pathways and genes, especially DOCK8 and TGF-beta pathway.

88d91646f0ff05addbecf945c9255420c077b37c,The Interaction between Pesticide Use and Genetic Variants Involved in Lipid Metabolism on Prostate Cancer Risk,"Background. Lipid metabolism processes have been implicated in prostate carcinogenesis. Since several pesticides are lipophilic or are metabolized via lipid-related mechanisms, they may interact with variants of genes in the lipid metabolism pathway. Methods. In a nested case-control study of 776 cases and 1444 controls from the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a prospective cohort study of pesticide applicators, we examined the interactions between 39 pesticides (none, low, and high exposure) and 220 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 59 genes. The false discovery rate (FDR) was used to account for multiple comparisons. Results. We found 17 interactions that displayed a significant monotonic increase in prostate cancer risk with pesticide exposure in one genotype and no significant association in the other genotype. The most noteworthy association was for ALOXE3 rs3027208 and terbufos, such that men carrying the T allele who were low users had an OR of 1.86 (95% CI = 1.16-2.99) and high users an OR of 2.00 (95% CI = 1.28-3.15) compared to those with no use of terbufos, while men carrying the CC genotype did not exhibit a significant association. Conclusion. Genetic variation in lipid metabolism genes may modify pesticide associations with prostate cancer; however our results require replication.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Gabriella Andreotti"", ids = ""3003370""); list(name = ""Stella Koutros"", ids = ""3662087""); list(name = ""Sonja I.

The monolithic support was activated by ethylenediamine followed by glutaraldehyde. Trypsin was then introduced to form an immobilized enzyme reactor (IMER). The prepared IMER showed a reliable mechanical stability and permeability (permeability constant K=2.65Ã—10(-13) m(2)). With BSA as the model protein, efficient digestion was completed within 20s, yielding the sequence coverage of 57%, better than that obtained from the traditional in-solution digestion (42%), which took about 12h. Moreover, BSA down to femtomole was efficiently digested by the IMER and positively identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). To test the applicability of IMER for complex sample profiling, proteins extracted from Escherichia coli were digested by the IMER and further analyzed by nanoreversed phase liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (nanoRPLC-ESI-MS/MS). In comparison to in-solution digestion, despite slightly fewer proteins were positively identified at a false discovery rate (FDR) of âˆ¼1% (333 vs 411), the digestion time used was largely shortened (20s vs 24 h), implying superior digestion performance for the high throughput analysis of complex samples.",2011,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shuaibin Wu"", ids = ""3786198""); list(name = ""Liangliang Sun"", ids = ""2454822""); list(name = ""Junfeng Ma"", ids = ""145608503""); list(name = ""Kaiguang Yang"", ids = ""6580838""); list(name = ""Zhen Liang"", ids = ""143741147""); list(name = ""Lihua Zhang"", ids = ""1930287""); list(name = ""Yukui Zhang"", ids = ""13584666"")",361adf520ec3fc1a2ffedb2cd38bf95a3ef408e6; 4e03c1e81860dd68741b6980bba5fc8453be4516; 07e2939ebdbd697d747b18feb8e8093eed7c8340; 53afd26f87d5ee046243019285c9c71f278ad275,,Talanta,83 5,"

6ed1117b255f30ba7b8bd92fc871eec22904c741,Allele-Specific Expression of CD4+ T Cells in Response to Marekâ€™s Disease Virus Infection,"Marek's disease (MD) is a T cell lymphoma disease induced by Marek's disease virus (MDV), a highly oncogenic Î± herpesvirus primarily affecting chickens. MD is a chronic infectious disease that threatens the poultry industry. However, the mechanisms of genetic resistance for MD are complex and not completely understood. In this study, to identify high-confidence candidate genes of MD genetic resistance, high throughput sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to obtain transcriptomic data of CD4+ T cells isolated from MDV-infected and non-infected groups of two reciprocal crosses of individuals mating by two highly inbred chicken lines (63 MD-resistant and 72 MD-susceptible). After RNA-seq analysis with two biological replicates in each group, we identified 61 and 123 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) annotated in 39 and 132 genes in intercrosses 63 Ã— 72 and 72 Ã— 63, respectively, which exhibited allele-specific expression (ASE) in response to MDV infection. Similarly, we identified 62 and 79 SNPs annotated in 66 and 96 genes in infected and non-infected groups, respectively. We identified 534 and 1543 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR < 0.05) related to MDV infection in intercrosses 63 Ã— 72 and 72 Ã— 63, respectively. We also identified 328 and 20 DEGs in infected and non-infected groups, respectively. The qRT-PCR using seven DEGs further verified our results of RNA-seq analysis. The qRT-PCR of 11 important ASE genes was performed for gene functional validation in CD4+ T cells and tumors. Combining the analyses, six genes (MCL1, SLC43A2, PDE3B, ADAM33, BLB1, and DMB2), especially MCL1, were highlighted as the candidate genes with the potential to be involved in MDV infection. Gene-set enrichment analysis revealed that many ASE genes are linked to T cell activation, T cell receptor (TCR), B cell receptor (BCR), ERK/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT-mTOR signaling pathways, which play potentially important roles in MDV infection. Our approach underlines the importance of comprehensive functional studies for gaining valuable biological insight into the genetic factors behind MD and other complex traits, and our findings provide additional insights into the mechanisms of MD and disease resistance breeding in poultry.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hao Bai"", ids = ""2245433""); list(name = ""Yanghua He"", ids = ""38207879""); list(name = ""Yi Ding"", ids = ""18971700""); list(name = ""JosÃ© AdriÃ¡n Carrillo"", ids = ""49300696""); list(name = ""Ramesh Kumar Selvaraj"", ids = ""144869966""); list(name = ""Huanmin Zhang"", ids = ""36440891""); list(name = ""Jilan Chen"", ids = ""118453528""); list(name = ""Jiuzhou Song"", ids = ""1733897"")",,0e68beebb4c7ccbd9d3b410b84481ae48908d029; 1166db008b911b669b4444f1755dfc31272eaa78; a992c8fd24587f12d41f48df84b29d847634c0e4; 24a3ccb1e5d878bd5f8215cb963d7bf63943f9e7; b2460a48e9a21d5fd21e0efeef63df879392accf; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 1609d9402c2bf459ee1e23b0e03e4581dac29290; 0b0bdd9a1d1ee21eecdd7d1b8870269d30631d6c; bd0e5257c2b3ebed098c6f605d65c4c1f5c360f0; 73e2ea779ab58f081cb4d78b08f75fd1f00f6db8; 827851efe556cd35ca2a5f3fcce431248ea500d5; a842b3ae05dd8133f0be1532b57e9e9e132ea151; cd3b30d9033f7ca3ffe66677309c23d6a9959dd5; e3b05bb1e11031b17df89c7cba6031e99a0fb4d7; 5c3a2a00b43bb67b2b629a21ce56711be0ba8855; bd5b80f2a55125c16d068c2bed355cd105263398; e84211657546b37af6457ad776e90d6ebd1742b8; 2155ee9e4f3f54e61095e19fb18e760e63ca662f; 7f10348cb0384b43fd796ae9df9bea85d2c018c9; cb6751ebebb8940fb6df4a27c7f4a3b5e5c2bde3; cc90910b6e31fe44cddc1e341f21eec0aaa5db44; 6962cbdf61131bb3db8c973abe7a47ae2fd487a6; 587ddea93af5b93ef028c0a70b0d54e9a517c119; 47a814bcb0a98009e44f3ca4df5028b1d65ce34f; 9c966b36abdd9077be8004001b097ce09f7d0f9e; 7974668b84d7aeeb655afd806e9152ca9113288b; 54400558caa96fb1361ff30b115b829754e18065; b946efcacb823bd5ae000fb7cbd7dfc6a07ef15b; 2914f25bccdffe4132f91387fa6b822f07f373be; 15bed645e0f60528270a88324f911f735c727283; 0cbb077c9284ee74e92d6af216f7c231c9562ae9; f386e94de5ef6c33875a9547d5b2a327ae9d1392; bee6cb619eb674041d9e42caf68708333d2506c4; ad4fc7dbe12eaf6bf577568f3a06ec9ed4b2d0f2; cf0e9e5b9e8afe53c0a9c6bd902442c745e43aec; 768b97bd5a8d4944be4a6f71b12ffad372a6ce5e; 90a4b0ffe9aa28629d2ea44cfa12ba4153f221b3; 4bff4d97e8b6823e3683f6a4ea31f9497b56abc7; f407edff0e3a8faa6cd686d9afd32d2afdf8144e; f995e0be49ba43b6d3324af2ee00c6a3be84d210; 77a328562d22b3fbb4df704bad04896bd9206681; 76e0814d72dc97c40a820f7e23b4a459642ce6c8; a0091381e6abe896c0884a315370b2970b1ded62; 728bcdf16dd2bc919e6049fed82b662411585c30; c765cf84e68c3f4b40798ceac319cf51efa2d24a; ccf7213de0d442b056e3cbe5b0a78a353bdc486d; 175de76b2a6e634424cfa1f802dc0068b97f7d80; dd833d84dc4ee2e90477a8d6559235519555a06e; 41c0c3ee54e915c545f1b430eb3a81b889ab64d8; 593a75e7231191aa6a7b23830ad6a5c7ba83de78; b4da5cc2676b86904a898490fc1c0a86906983d8; b9f1dc20e230bb883d6f5de18061b0499c1ca6d3; 0dd03b98161db869e2bc0ed65433be0a9a9cc082; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 6fca260e9a3c37e246cc15e7639d1a5fa2aed465,Genes,10,
390515a736bad4d0862764a8c70fabedd70b4e36,Improving MHC-I Ligand Identifications from LC-MS/MS Data by Incorporating Allelic Peptide Motifs.,"MHC class I (MHC-I)-bound ligands play a pivotal role in CD8 T cell immunity and are hence of major interest in understanding and designing immunotherapies. One of the most commonly utilized approaches for detecting MHC ligands is LC-MS/MS. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of current algorithms to identify MHC ligands from LC-MS/MS data is limited because the search algorithms used were originally developed for proteomics approaches detecting tryptic peptides. Consequently, the analysis often results in inflated false discovery rate (FDR) statistics and an overall decrease in the number of peptides that pass FDR filters. Andreatta etÂ al. describe a new scoring tool (MS-rescue) for peptides from MHC-I immunopeptidome datasets. MS-rescue incorporates the existence of MHC-I peptide motifs to rescore peptides from ligandome data. The tool is demonstrated here using peptides assigned from LC-MS/MS data with PEAKs software but can be deployed on data from any search algorithm. This new approach increased the number of peptides identified by up to 20-30% and promises to aid the discovery of novel MHC-I ligands with immunotherapeutic potential.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Prathyusha Konda"", ids = ""10740687""); list(name = ""J.

8c12097d21691e9f844c5a4a94ad470ef35ba4e6,Importance of manual validation for the identification of phosphopeptides using a linear ion trap mass spectrometer.,"Accurate determination of protein phosphorylation is challenging, particularly for researchers who lack access to a high-accuracy mass spectrometer. In this study, multiple protocols were used to enrich phosphopeptides, and a rigorous filtering workflow was used to analyze the resulting samples. Phosphopeptides were enriched from cultured rat renal proximal tubule cells using three commonly used protocols and a dual method that combines separate immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) chromatography, termed dual IMAC (DIMAC). Phosphopeptides from all four enrichment strategies were analyzed by liquid chromatography-multiple levels of mass spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) neutral-loss scanning using a linear ion trap mass spectrometer. Initially, the resulting MS(2) and MS(3) spectra were analyzed using PeptideProphet and database search engine thresholds that produced a false discovery rate (FDR) of <1.5% when searched against a reverse database. However, only 40% of the potential phosphopeptides were confirmed by manual validation. The combined analyses yielded 110 confidently identified phosphopeptides. Using less-stringent initial filtering thresholds (FDR of 7-9%), followed by rigorous manual validation, 262 unique phosphopeptides, including 111 novel phosphorylation sites, were identified confidently. Thus, traditional methods of data filtering within widely accepted FDRs were inadequate for the analysis of low-resolution phosphopeptide spectra. However, the combination of a streamlined front-end enrichment strategy and rigorous manual spectral validation allowed for confident phosphopeptide identifications from a complex sample using a low-resolution ion trap mass spectrometer.",2011,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""David A.

To show that an increased correlation between CpGs after selection through an epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) might translate into biased replication results.


METHODS
Pairwise correlation coefficients between CpGs selected in two published EWAS, the top hits replication, Bonferroni p-values, Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) false discovery rate (FDR) and directional FDR r-values were calculated in the NINFEA cohort data. Exposures' random permutations were performed to show the empirical p-value distributions.


RESULTS
The average pairwise correlation coefficients between CpGs were enhanced after selection for the replication (e.g., from 0.12 at genome-wide level to 0.26 among the selected CpGs), affecting the empirical p-value distributions and the usual multiple testing control.


CONCLUSION
Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg FDR are inappropriate for the EWAS replication phase, and methods that account for the underlying correlation need to be used.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Maja Popovic"", ids = ""143608343""); list(name = ""Francesca Fasanelli"", ids = ""4047232""); list(name = ""Valentina Fiano"", ids = ""6377613""); list(name = ""Annibale Biggeri"", ids = ""2595514""); list(name = ""Lorenzo Richiardi"", ids = ""6154599"")",,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 7a31408b1b25c4eb8cc6ae7c281b77dc66ef0b7a; d3a603ea9664d3dc8911875e16d1fd22e46cd10b; 6756da5a0d5e037a0c143e6418b85633561c927c; 023ff2135ce180f8b6843cfbdb250ea456fd681a; 8b208d277b62355a30dbee112e5629bd64637c0b; 43db684dc246d0f28a36b7cec3b84f1fe2cef0b4; 6e8edbbc1715213ec094a181f139a52d20c47931; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; c8d1966279a0571229c9527c783925ed8d5d7f04; 68759488229aca1ee25e8cb75eeae746557829aa; dcdc0a0be7d65257c4e6a9117f69e246fb227423; ceea673f6dc0e1025e8fc7e731309888033f1ef7; c5ca3b347eafd7b6d8054967e6c6fcf5f852604c; c121d8d35ec167b2e33a82b4e2057a63bc64e510; da5bd139b0b0431d2c2611b8b4ba1f00a5b22f09; bbcd6e2fe6ad3f70e1c5fa828153348ac583276e; de97265c2425bf2e32c0e81c62fa6a25c711c423; 39dae53515afb42664369c291ec6d1ce34d778bd; 5398e36689b8fff60fe1f6991ccd1bcc7e3b80ff; 6b6cc549ef1f0c2dc92b1560c5a410f1d2df9d38; 23665ae3af7bb4331417b8eb3a289ea5f70379dc; 7241c748932deb734fff1681e951e50be0853a39; 217aba004977480711b1c181861e3924398296e9; e9c47efee39397d5f1d4d4059c864c44fca004cb; f1bcbe5845406cf32742e8d2219498c23337f9a5; f945f6f12acb6fd2dfaabef0a9bb1bd50daf35a8,Epigenomics,9 12,"

ae6a70bcdb0868feaf0b0c505774806a2cc6ad7c,Characterisation of the circulating acellular proteome of healthy sheep using LC-MS/MS-based proteomics analysis of serum,"BackgroundUnlike humans, there is currently no publicly available reference mass spectrometry-based circulating acellular proteome data for sheep, limiting the analysis and interpretation of a range of physiological changes and disease states. The objective of this study was to develop a robust and comprehensive method to characterise the circulating acellular proteome in ovine serum.MethodsSerum samples from healthy sheep were subjected to shotgun proteomic analysis using nano liquid chromatography nano electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-nanoESI-MS/MS) on a quadrupole time-of-flight instrument (TripleTOFÂ® 5600+, SCIEX). Proteins were identified using ProteinPilotâ„¢ (SCIEX) and Mascot (Matrix Science) software based on a minimum of two unmodified highly scoring unique peptides per protein at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% software by searching a subset of the Universal Protein Resource Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) database (http://www.uniprot.org). PeptideShaker (CompOmics, VIB-UGent) searches were used to validate protein identifications from ProteinPilotâ„¢ and Mascot.ResultsProteinPilotâ„¢ and Mascot identified 245 and 379 protein groups (IDs), respectively, and PeptideShaker validated 133 protein IDs from the entire dataset. Since Mascot software is considered the industry standard and identified the most proteins, these were analysed using the Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) classification tool revealing the association of 349 genes with 127 protein pathway hits. These data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD004989.ConclusionsThese results demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of characterising the ovine circulating acellular proteome using nanoLC-nanoESI-MS/MS. This peptide spectral data contributes to a protein library that can be used to identify a wide range of proteins in ovine serum.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Saul Chemonges"", ids = ""5765329""); list(name = ""Rajesh Gupta"", ids = ""50517366""); list(name = ""Paul C.

1f14d6039b8021b18246bd61ee536567f681da80,Candidate gene analysis in israeli soldiers with stress fractures.,"To investigate the association of polymorphisms within candidate genes which we hypothesized may contribute to stress fracture predisposition, a case-control, cross- sectional study design was employed. Genotyping 268 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms- SNPs within 17 genes in 385 Israeli young male and female recruits (182 with and 203 without stress fractures). Twenty-five polymorphisms within 9 genes (NR3C1, ANKH, VDR, ROR2, CALCR, IL6, COL1A2, CBG, and LRP4) showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in the distribution between stress fracture cases and non stress fracture controls. Seventeen genetic variants were associated with an increased stress fracture risk, and eight variants with a decreased stress fracture risk. None of the SNP associations remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate- FDR). Our findings suggest that genes may be involved in stress fracture pathogenesis. Specifically, the CALCR and the VDR genes are intriguing candidates. The putative involvement of these genes in stress fracture predisposition requires analysis of more cases and controls and sequencing the relevant genomic regions, in order to define the specific gene mutations.

This study attempted to identify potential biomarkers by detecting changes in the levels of plasma proteins in T2DM patients following onset of AMI in comparison with those without AMI. Volunteer T2DM patients without AMI (control; n=10) and T2DM patients with AMI (n=10) were recruited. Plasma samples from these patients were evaluated via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) to screen for proteins with level changes between the two groups. The abundance of spots on gel images was analyzed using Progenesis SameSpots and subjected to false discovery rate (FDR) analysis. Protein spots with statistically significant changes of at least 1.5 fold were selected for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Due to strong cardiac connections, tetranectin and titin were evaluated by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The adjusted P-values and fold changes between the two groups resulted in identification of 34 protein spots with significantly altered abundance. Upon MS analysis, 17 plasma proteins were identified: tetranectin, titin, clusterin, haptoglobin, myosin-13, zinc fnger protein 445, DNA repair protein RAD50, serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-IV, caspase-6, aminoacyl tRNA synthase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1, serotransferrin, retinol-binding protein 4, transthyretin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein A-I and serum amyloid A. Comparable patterns of changes in tetranectin and titin between the control and AMI groups were confirmed using ELISA. In summary, tetranectin and titin in plasma appeared to be closely associated with the onset of AMI among T2DM patients and can be used as potential biomarkers for prediction of a cardiac event, though this requires validation in a prospective cohort study.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mohd Aizat Abdul Rahim"", ids = ""39117301""); list(name = ""Zubaidah Haji Abdul Rahim"", ids = ""144781872""); list(name = ""Wan Azman Wan Ahmad"", ids = ""3333872""); list(name = ""Marina Mohd Bakri"", ids = ""2922236""); list(name = ""Muhammad Dzafir Ismail"", ids = ""47393998""); list(name = ""Onn Haji Hashim"", ids = ""9209213"")",16646d33f134b587f8beb5b5edfedcbe3d30470f; 0148cb16f90a1f9809eea8923f9892a20d2cb542,ecb6f0496d726c865c4aad9d42656262fcfd7018; 79aa0f0b48cb80e15dd140172faec13bc3553493; ad2ab8bfe0d214a56c7de20d229081064c121f56; ee69a0b71c19e7f924d634a14c55bcfcb95b7104; f1239ea65809cc78f51d64e5bbc9ae23cee41ab1; f17c78d07dbe14e9d250f57156500e63ee558ee7; 50e02b6161813956b7d07d113d4e8906b31d0dd6; 9c3662efb095f79cee5fdb808554855c8dbd3012; aeb09b0b3b3688cb0247b7227c59d925969242bb; 06f48ea5f1c110f2a99ec74309c5f6068f38ed87; a789471ce84bcd7374a8630164cb08cb42846410; 5d3d9464d19cef008c4517100d6508b7d8fbc09b; 94c48a1fe7ef343481c3a82a9476e3d3b910948a; 1a74bd79b10ab44445279240ab2a257df1b579e1; 25cdcd99df41b75e32fdccc192a2e9ec0a3924d1; d71541f0055744398fb92d8edb917c6f823e7dce; e9976b2a24efd797432a5ef07f2830957431dda1; e6656810ce814f10fdb9fc78598f61461e977136; b5964926e9f7dd4c96a103521fecdd72650c307e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e2ba8639e9a556c768d3694c86eb5bf88e76c508; 0096757a7f4abbc19b04a5e67f5855c234450110; 75edd932aab1070c3886753ebd493d53e4fbb93b; 8da2fbd73b7af057743c3a7091b7b9a15b12e36c; 85994364ffa8ac709c5cf5fe9756cb966ece17d3; df9d97cbf532dd7b2f82b5c7c6b9926ecae5f0c7,Acta Pharmacologica Sinica,39,1197 - 1207
f16858701aa0a31efc46504011ed30f1caa94e46,A Diagnostic Test Approach for Multitesting Problems,"In the last decades, multiple-testing problems have received much attention. Many different methods have been proposed in order to deal with this relevant issue. Most of them are focused on controlling some weak version of the Type I error such as the False Discovery Rate. Type II error is frequently forgotten. In this work, the multitesting problem is treated from a diagnostic test approach in which the p-values play the role of the studied predictive marker. In this context, the receiver operating characteristic, ROC, curve is estimated. Several Monte Carlo simulations help for a better understanding of the problem.

47fd9213a698a71fc3d2ab3a0e9b8c13596fc2d5,[Analysis of gene expression data regulated by clock-genes: methodological approach and optimization].,"BACKGROUND
In microarray data, wide-scale correlations are numerous and increase the number of genes correlated to a test condition (phenotype, mutation status, etc.) either positively or negatively. Several methods have been developed to limit the effect of such correlations on the false discovery rate, but these may reject too many genes that have a mild or indirect impact on the studied condition. We propose here a simple methodology to correct this spurious effect without eliminating weak but true correlations.


RESULTS
This methodology was applied to a microarray dataset designed to distinguish heterozygous BRCA1 mutation carriers from non-carriers. As our samples were collected at different times in the morning, we evaluated the effect of correlations due to circadian rhythm. The circadian system is a well-known correlation network, regulated by a small number of period genes whose expression varies throughout the day in predictable ways. The downstream effects of this variation on the expression of other genes, however, are incompletely characterized. We used two different strategies to correct this correlation bias, by either dividing or multiplying the expression of correlated genes by the expression of the considered period gene according to the sign of the correlation between the period gene and correlated gene (respectively positive or negative).


CONCLUSIONS
We observed a linear relationship between the number of false-positive/negative genes and the strength of the correlation of the candidate gene to the test condition. BRCA1 was highly correlated to the period gene Per1; our correction methodology enabled us to recover genes coding for BRCA1-interacting proteins which were not selected in the initial direct analysis. This methodology may be valuable for other studies and can be applied very easily in case of well-known correlation networks.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""M-L Vuillaume"", ids = ""153942745""); list(name = ""Fabrice Kwiatkowski"", ids = ""3775783""); list(name = ""Nancy Uhrhammer"", ids = ""6844610""); list(name = ""Yannick Bidet"", ids = ""4720861""); list(name = ""Y.-J.

febdb4c6e5e297ba60e87529c41d37b368c3293b,"Contribution of the putative genetic factors and ANKH gene polymorphisms to variation of circulating calciotropic molecules, PTH and BGP.","It is well known that regulation of calcium homeostasis in bone remodeling is one of the most crucial factors for maintaining healthy bones. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is probably the most important hormone that participates in the bone remodeling process. Another important biochemical factor governing bone metabolism is osteocalcin (BGP). Although the physiological functions of both of these factors are well known, there is still very little known regarding their specific genetic determination and in particular, the specific genes that may regulate the circulating concentrations of these substances. In the present study, we examined whether nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human homologue of the mouse progressive ankylosis gene (ANKH)-one of the key genetic factors involved in bone mineralization-can be associated with PTH and BGP levels in apparently healthy human populations. The study sample comprised 244 nuclear families (840 individuals). After adjustment of BGP and PTH for the significant covariates (sex, age and BMI), the contribution of the putative genetic effects was statistically significant (P < 0.001) for both biochemical factors: 45.27 +/- 10.8% for PTH and 30.19 +/- 12.6% for BGP. Application of transmission disequilibrium tests (TDTs) revealed a significant association (P < 0.05) between PTH and two SNPs: rs39968 and rs875525. However, the association became particularly significant for four TDTs (P-values ranging from 0.0025 to 0.0008) when the association with the haplotypes generated from the above SNP was tested. This association remained significant even after correction for multiple testing with a false discovery rate of 0.05.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yulia Vistoropsky"", ids = ""4520023""); list(name = ""Michal Keter"", ids = ""13075208""); list(name = ""Ida Malkin"", ids = ""113578809""); list(name = ""Svetlana Trofimov"", ids = ""143623886""); list(name = ""Eugene Kobyliansky"", ids = ""5413060""); list(name = ""Gregory Livshits"", ids = ""145529366"")",35da94d1dbd952026f2ad2aef397d03006ef2ae2; 33893d14e8629fbc5364427f5c231373fa9554c8; d2188e150375292dbfdda93fc18e28fa6687b024; 6796e0918526eba2f4f837283f627288efc91206,,Human molecular genetics,16 10,"

06751bc55c8968711c9989f6c1ffad6abde03b30,Abstract P260: Genome-wide Pathway and Network-based Approaches Identify Novel Genetic Loci and Pathways for Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes in an Ethnically Diverse Cohort of American Women,"Introduction: Despite the success of recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in identifying genetic loci associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes (T2D), a comprehensive examination of GWAS data for identifying biological pathways underlying their specific or shared genetic mechanisms is lacking, especially in an ethnicity-specific manner.

Hypothesis: We hypothesized that genetic variation clustered in biological pathways is associated with an increased risk of CVD and T2D.

Methods: We applied a pathway and network-based approach to characterize GWAS signals in sets of biological pathways for their contribution to CVD and T2D in two separate nation-wide populations of ethnically diverse women from the Womenâ€™s Health Initiative (WHI) Cohort, the WHI SNP Health Association Resource(WHI-SHARe) and the Genomics and Randomized Trials Network(WHI-GARNET), involving 8,155 African American, 3,494 Hispanic American, and 3,697 Caucasian American women.

Results: Eight pathways were identified to be significantly enriched for CVD, T2D, and combined CVD and T2D across the three ethnic groups at false discovery rate <0.001, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, calcium signaling pathway, axon guidance, cell adhesion molecules, focal adhesion, and ECM-receptor interaction pathways. We also identified disease- and ethnicity-specific pathways, such as cell cycle (specific for Hispanic and Caucasian Americans) and tight junction (CVD and combined CVD + T2D in Hispanic Americans).

Conclusions: By applying pathway- and network-based analyses to two large GWAS from three ethnic groups of American women, we identified shared biological pathways for CVD and T2D and disease- and ethnicity-specific pathways. These results provide evidence for multiple pathways underlying the pathogenesis of CVD and T2D in three genetically distinct populations and implicate the complex etiology of cardiometabolic disease.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kei Hang K Chan"", ids = ""4850291""); list(name = ""Yen-Tsung Huang"", ids = ""2649637""); list(name = ""Yi-Hsiang Hsu"", ids = ""2128747""); list(name = ""Yiqing Song"", ids = ""1747073""); list(name = ""Andrea L.

554590fffff8ba030a5fcf9eb831f56c7e447c71,Association between proteomics and obstructive sleep apnea phenotypes in a community-based cohort of women.,"Proteomic-based technologies offer new opportunities to identify proteins that might reflect the cardiometabolic stress caused by different aspects of sleep-disordered breathing. We aimed to investigate whether severe obstructive sleep apnea and severe obstructive sleep apnea during rapid eye movement sleep are associated with changed levels of inflammatory and cardiac disease-related proteins in a population-based cohort of women. In the community-based ""Sleep and Health in Women"" (SHE) cohort study, 400 women underwent polysomnography, anthropometric measurements and blood sampling. Two proteomic assays (Olink ProseekÂ® Inflammation panel and Olink ProseekÂ® Cardiovascular II panel), each measuring 92 proteins, were analysed in a subsample of 253 women. p-Values were adjusted for multiple testing, with false discovery rate set at 10%. In unadjusted models, 57 proteins were associated with apnea-hypopnea index, 56 proteins with oxygen desaturation index and 64 proteins with rapid eye movement-apnea-hypopnea index. After adjustment for age, body mass index and plate, there were no significant associations between apnea-hypopnea index or oxygen desaturation index and any of the proteins. Severe obstructive sleep apnea during rapid eye movement sleep (rapid eye movement-apnea-hypopnea indexâ€…â‰¥â€…30) was associated with decreased levels of two anti-inflammatory proteins; Sirt2 (q-value .016) and LAP-TGF-Î²1 (q-value .016). There was also a negative association between rapid eye movement-apnea-hypopnea index of â‰¥â€…30 and Axin1 (q-value .095), a protein thought to facilitate TGF-Î²-signalling. We conclude that severe obstructive sleep apnea during rapid eye movement sleep is associated with low levels of Sirt2, LAP-TGF-Î²1 and Axin1, anti-inflammatory proteins involved in metabolic regulation and in the atherosclerotic process. For obstructive sleep apnea based on a whole night, the associations with cardiac and inflammatory proteins are weaker, and explained to a large extent by age and body mass index.",2020,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mirjam Ljunggren"", ids = ""32433212""); list(name = ""Jenny Theorell-HaglÃ¶w"", ids = ""1398782328""); list(name = ""Eva Freyhult"", ids = ""1679442""); list(name = ""Carin Sahlin"", ids = ""7298450""); list(name = ""Karl A.

The current study aimed to explore gene expression and methylation differences between LUAD and LUSC. EdgeR was used to identify differentially regulated genes between normal and cancer in the LUAD and LUSC extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), respectively, whereas SAM was used to find genes with differential methylation between normal and cancer in the LUAD and LUSC, respectively. Finally, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis was performed to analyze the function which these genes enriched in. A total of 391 genes with opposite methylation patterns in LUAD and LUSC and four functional pathways were obtained (false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.1). These pathways mainly included fat digestion and absorption, phenylalanine metabolism, bile secretion, and so on, which were related to the airframe nutrition metabolic pathway. Moreover, two genes CTSE (cathepsin E) and solute carrier family 5 member 7 (SLC5A7) were also found, among which CTSE was overexpressed and hypomethylated in LUAD corresponding to normal lung tissues, whereas SLC5A7 showed the opposite in LUAD. In conclusion, this study investigated the differences between the gene expression and methylation patterns in LUAD and LUSC, and explored their different biological characteristics. Further understanding of these differences may promote the discovery and development of new, accurate strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of lung cancer.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yang Yang"", ids = ""47796449""); list(name = ""Meng Wang"", ids = ""6904931""); list(name = ""Bao Liu"", ids = ""143727615"")",047d3530547a9b9f19d673198510164eab131112; 41f1a6c7d554764505900fa01f00b9bd1f66308e; 8ba9f51263586dbb7d30a632d2f2a83355f6ab64,,Journal of cellular physiology,234 4,"

However, in general it is not evident how to choose the weights in a data-dependent manner. We describe independent hypothesis weighting (IHW), a method for making use of informative covariates that are independent of the test statistic under the null, but informative of each testâ€™s power or prior probability of the null hypothesis. Covariates can be continuous or categorical and need not fulfill any particular assumptions. The method increases statistical power in applications while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) and produces additional insight by revealing the covariate-weight relationship.

4aebde8ecdbd56fc73658ba62dc9f9127eb2534f,Prediction of S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy efficacy in stage II/III gastric cancer treatment based on comprehensive gene expression analysis,"Abstract Background Studies to identify predictive biomarkers of adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 after gastrectomy in Stage II/III gastric cancer patients have been done; however, more clarity and understanding are needed. Our aim in the present study was to identify biomarkers predicting benefit due to S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy using comprehensive gene expression analysis. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 102 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 and 46 patients not receiving S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy after gastrectomy for gastric cancer treatment between January 2014 and December 2016. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed based on the gene expression data obtained using DNA microarrays. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using thresholds of absolute fold changes (FCs) ofÂ >Â 4.0 and a false discovery rate (FDR) P value ofÂ  Results Hierarchical clustering analysis in patients treated with S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy revealed two clusters with favorable and unfavorable survival outcomes. We identified 147 upregulated DEGs and 192 downregulated DEGs in the favorable outcome group. GO analysis to identify significantly upregulated genes showed enrichment in immune-related genes and GO terms. Upregulation of these immune-related genes was not associated with survival in patients not receiving S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusions The upregulation and enrichment of immune-related genes and GO terms may be a predictive biomarker in patients who would benefit from adjuvant S-1 chemotherapy to treat Stage II/III gastric cancer.

8fc821f2a739faef1984e87eb7625db819e78758,Bibliography Reverse Engineering Genetic Networks Using the Genenet Package,"GeneNet is a package for analyzing high-dimensional (time series) data obtained from high-throughput functional genomics assays, such as expression microarrays or metabolic profiling. Specifically , GeneNet allows to infer large-scale gene association networks. These are graphical Gaussian models (GGMs) that represent multivariate dependencies in biomolecular networks by means of partial correlation. Therefore, the output of an analysis conducted by GeneNet is a graph where each gene corresponds to a node and the edges included in the graph portray direct dependencies between them. GeneNet implements a specific learning algorithm that allows to estimate GGMs from small sample high-dimensional data that is both computation-ally as well as statistically efficient. This approach relies on analytic shrinkage estimation of covariance and (partial) correlation matrices and on model selection using (local) false discovery rate multiple testing. Hence, GeneNet includes a computational algorithm that decides which edges are to be included in the final network, in dependence of the relative values of the pairwise partial correlations. In a recent comparative survey (Werhli et al., 2006) the GeneNet procedure was found to recover the topology of gene regulatory networks with similar accuracy as computationally much more demanding methods such as dynamical Bayesian networks (Friedman, 2004). We note that the approach implemented in GeneNet should be regarded as an exploratory approach that may help to identify interesting genes (such as "" hubs "") or clusters of genes that are functionally related or co-regulated, rather than that it yields the precise network of mechanistic interactions. Therefore, the resulting network topologies need be interpreted and validated in the light of biological background information, ideally accompanied by further integrative analysis employing data from different levels of the cellular system.

9b03addd98211ab20627b09018a756a04efeec7d,Genome-wide DNA methylation at birth in relation to in utero arsenic exposure and the associated health in later life,"BackgroundIn utero arsenic exposure may alter fetal developmental programming by altering DNA methylation, which may result in a higher risk of disease in later life. We evaluated the association between in utero arsenic exposure and DNA methylation (DNAm) in cord blood and its influence in later life.MethodsGenome-wide DNA methylation in cord blood from 64 subjects in the Taiwanese maternal infant and birth cohort was analyzed. Robust regressions were applied to assess the association of DNA methylation with in utero arsenic exposure. Multiple testing was adjusted by controlling false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05. The DAVID bioinformatics tool was implemented for functional annotation analyses on the detected CpGs. The identified CpGs were further tested in an independent cohort. For the CpGs replicated in the independent cohort, linear mixed models were applied to assess the association of DNA methylation with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) at different ages (2, 5, 8, 11 and 14Â years).ResultsIn total, 579 out of 385,183 CpGs were identified after adjusting for multiple testing (FDRÂ =Â 0.05), of which ~60% were positively associated with arsenic exposure. Functional annotation analysis on these CpGs detected 17 KEGG pathways (FDRÂ =Â 0.05) including pathways for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes mellitus. In the independent cohort, about 46% (252 out of 553 CpGs) of the identified CpGs showed associations consistent with those in the study cohort. In total, 11 CpGs replicated in the independent cohort were in the pathways related to CVD and diabetes mellitus. Via longitudinal analyses, we found at 5 out of the 11 CpGs methylation was associated with LDL over time and interactions between DNA methylation and time were observed at 4 of the 5 CpGs, cg25189764 (coeffÂ =Â 0.157, p-valueÂ =Â 0.047), cg04986899 (coeff. For interaction [coeff.int]Â =Â 0.030, p-valueÂ =Â 0.024), cg04903360 (coeff.intÂ =Â 0.026, p-valueÂ =Â 0.032), cg08198265 (coeff.intÂ =Â âˆ’0.063, p-valueÂ =Â 0.0021), cg10473311 (coeff.intÂ =Â âˆ’0.021, p-valueÂ =Â 0.027).ConclusionIn utero arsenic exposure was associated with cord blood DNA methylation at various CpGs. The identified CpGs may help determine pathological epigenetic mechanisms linked to in utero arsenic exposure.

c52269fd206f38778845265ebb70d11461e7d4ed,Motor pathway injury in patients with periventricular leucomalacia and spastic diplegia.,"Periventricular leucomalacia has long been investigated as a leading cause of motor and cognitive dysfunction in patients with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. However, patients with periventricular leucomalacia on conventional magnetic resonance imaging do not always have motor dysfunction and preterm children without neurological abnormalities may have periventricular leucomalacia. In addition, it is uncertain whether descending motor tract or overlying cortical injury is related to motor impairment. To investigate the relationship between motor pathway injury and motor impairment, we conducted voxelwise correlation analysis using tract-based spatial statistics of white matter diffusion anisotropy and voxel-based-morphometry of grey matter injury in patients with periventricular leucomalacia and spastic diplegia (nâ€‰=â€‰43, mean 12.86â€‰Â±â€‰4.79 years, median 12 years). We also evaluated motor cortical and thalamocortical connectivity at resting state in 11 patients using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The functional connectivity results of patients with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy were compared with those of age-matched normal controls. Since Î³-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors play an important role in the remodelling process, we measured neuronal Î³-aminobutyric acid(A) receptor binding potential with dynamic positron emission tomography scans (nâ€‰=â€‰27) and compared the binding potential map of the patient group with controls (nâ€‰=â€‰20). In the current study, white matter volume reduction did not show significant correlation with motor dysfunction. Although fractional anisotropy within most of the major white matter tracts were significantly lower than that of age-matched healthy controls (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, family wise error corrected), fractional anisotropy mainly within the bilateral corticospinal tracts and posterior body and isthmus of the corpus callosum showed more significant correlation with motor dysfunction (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.03) than thalamocortical pathways (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, family-wise error corrected). Cortical volume of the pre- and post-central gyri and the paracentral lobule tended to be negatively correlated with motor function. The motor cortical connectivity was diminished mainly within the bilateral somatosensory cortex, paracentral lobule, cingulate motor area and visual cortex in the patient group. Thalamovisual connectivity was not diminished despite severe optic radiation injury. Î³-Aminobutyric acid(A) receptor binding potential was focally increased within the lower extremity homunculus, cingulate cortex, visual cortex and cerebellum in the patient group (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, false discovery rate corrected). In conclusion, descending motor tract injury along with overlying cortical volume reduction and reduced functional connectivity appears to be a leading pathophysiological mechanism of motor dysfunction in patients with periventricular leucomalacia. Increased regional Î³-aminobutyric acid(A) receptor binding potential appears to result from a compensatory plasticity response after prenatal brain injury.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jong Doo Lee"", ids = ""2891776"");

c1ecc39628a0295c9970e9c3e4238ed548ddd188,Sleep and cognitive aging in the eighth decade of life,"We examined associations between self-reported sleep measures and cognitive level and change (age 70-76 years) in a longitudinal, same-year-of-birth cohort study (baseline N = 1091; longitudinal N = 664). We also leveraged GWAS summary data to ascertain whether polygenic scores (PGS) of chronotype and sleep duration related to self-reported sleep, and to cognitive level and change. Shorter sleep latency was associated with significantly higher levels of visuospatial ability, processing speed, and verbal memory (Î² â‰¥ |0.184|, SE â‰¤ 0.075, p â‰¤ 0.003). Longer daytime sleep duration was significantly associated slower processing speed (Î² = -0.085, SE = 0.027, p = 0.001), and with steeper 6-year decline in visuospatial reasoning (Î² = -0.009, SE = 0.003, p = 0.008), and processing speed (Î² = -0.009, SE = 0.002, p < 0.001). Only longitudinal associations between longer daytime sleeping and steeper cognitive declines survived correction for important health covariates and false discovery rate (FDR). PGS of chronotype and sleep duration were nominally associated with specific self-reported sleep characteristics for most SNP thresholds (standardized Î² range = |0.123 to 0.082|, p range = 0.003 to 0.046), but neither PGS predicted cognitive level or change following FDR. Daytime sleep duration is a potentially important correlate of cognitive decline in visuospatial reasoning and processing speed in older age, whereas cross-sectional associations are partially confounded by important health factors. A genetic propensity toward morningness and sleep duration were weakly, but consistently, related to self-reported sleep characteristics, and did not relate to cognitive level or change.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Simon R.

9219b51351143c72bb8f05bc7f1796038b8dcad6,Transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing analysis of rat skeletal muscle feed arteries. II. Impact of exercise training in obesity.,"We employed next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology to determine the extent to which exercise training alters global gene expression in skeletal muscle feed arteries and aortic endothelial cells of obese Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. Transcriptional profiles of the soleus and gastrocnemius muscle feed arteries (SFA and GFA, respectively) and aortic endothelial cell-enriched samples from rats that underwent an endurance exercise training program (EndEx; n = 12) or a interval sprint training program (IST; n = 12) or remained sedentary (Sed; n = 12) were examined. In response to EndEx, there were 39 upregulated (e.g., MANF) and 20 downregulated (e.g., ALOX15) genes in SFA and 1 upregulated (i.e., Wisp2) and 1 downregulated (i.e., Crem) gene in GFA [false discovery rate (FDR) < 10%]. In response to IST, there were 305 upregulated (e.g., MANF, HSPA12B) and 324 downregulated genes in SFA and 101 upregulated and 66 downregulated genes in GFA, with an overlap of 32 genes between arteries. Furthermore, in aortic endothelial cells, there were 183 upregulated (e.g., eNOS, SOD-3) and 141 downregulated (e.g., ATF3, Clec1b, npy, leptin) genes with EndEx and 71 upregulated and 69 downregulated genes with IST, with an overlap of 35 between exercise programs. Expression of only two genes (Tubb2b and Slc9a3r2) was altered (i.e., increased) by exercise in all three arteries.

671ac1f27720546744848a59b7f866c3dfd8b8f9,White Blood Cell Differentials Enrich Whole Blood Expression Data in the Context of Acute Cardiac Allograft Rejection,"Acute cardiac allograft rejection is a serious complication of heart transplantation. Investigating molecular processes in whole blood via microarrays is a promising avenue of research in transplantation, particularly due to the non-invasive nature of blood sampling. However, whole blood is a complex tissue and the consequent heterogeneity in composition amongst samples is ignored in traditional microarray analysis. This complicates the biological interpretation of microarray data. Here we have applied a statistical deconvolution approach, cell-specific significance analysis of microarrays (csSAM), to whole blood samples from subjects either undergoing acute heart allograft rejection (AR) or not (NR). We identified eight differentially expressed probe-sets significantly correlated to monocytes (mapping to 6 genes, all down-regulated in ARs versus NRs) at a false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤ 15%. None of the genes identified are present in a biomarker panel of acute heart rejection previously published by our group and discovered in the same data.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Casey P.

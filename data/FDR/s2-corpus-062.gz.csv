5c5f578e3e1df6593ceb2c64e6a1992f41bcbb01,Evaluation of the brain activation induced by functional electrical stimulation and voluntary contraction using functional magnetic resonance imaging,"BackgroundTo observe brain activation induced by functional electrical stimulation, voluntary contraction, and the combination of both using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).MethodsNineteen healthy young men were enrolled in the study. We employed a typical block design that consisted of three sessions: voluntary contraction only, functional electrical stimulation (FES)-induced wrist extension, and finally simultaneous voluntary and FES-induced movement. MRI acquisition was performed on a 3.0â€‰T MR system. To investigate activation in each session, one-sample t-tests were performed after correcting for false discovery rate (FDR; pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). To compare FES-induced movement and combined contraction, a two-sample t-test was performed using a contrast map (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01).ResultsIn the voluntary contraction alone condition, brain activation was observed in the contralateral primary motor cortex (MI), thalamus, bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), primary sensory cortex (SI), secondary somatosensory motor cortex (SII), caudate, and cerebellum (mainly ipsilateral). During FES-induced wrist movement, brain activation was observed in the contralateral MI, SI, SMA, thalamus, ipsilateral SII, and cerebellum. During FES-induced movement combined with voluntary contraction, brain activation was found in the contralateral MI, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), SMA, ipsilateral cerebellum, bilateral SII, and SI.The activated brain regions (number of voxels) of the MI, SI, cerebellum, and SMA were largest during voluntary contraction alone and smallest during FES alone. SII-activated brain regions were largest during voluntary contraction combined with FES and smallest during FES contraction alone. The brain activation extent (maximum t score) of the MI, SI, and SII was largest during voluntary contraction alone and smallest during FES alone. The brain activation extent of the cerebellum and SMA during voluntary contraction alone was similar during FES combined with voluntary contraction; however, cerebellum and SMA activation during FES movement alone was smaller than that of voluntary contraction alone or voluntary contraction combined with FES. Between FES movement alone and combined contraction, activated regions and extent due to combined contraction was significantly higher than that of FES movement alone in the ipsilateral cerebellum and the contralateral MI and SI.ConclusionsVoluntary contraction combined with FES may be more effective for brain activation than FES-only movements for rehabilitation therapy. In addition, voluntary effort is the most important factor in the therapeutic process.",2011,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Kyung-Lim Joa"", ids = ""5818818""); list(name = ""Yonghee Han"", ids = ""3110221""); list(name = ""Chi-Woong Mun"", ids = ""77059913""); list(name = ""Bong-Kyung Son"", ids = ""119859873""); list(name = ""Chang-Hyung Lee"", ids = ""19524868""); list(name = ""Yong-Beom Shin"", ids = ""40039997""); list(name = ""Hyun-Yoon Ko"", ids = ""38383416""); list(name = ""Yong-Il Shin"", ids = ""145179665"")",b8dd8d70511a9d2f1eeb03523169f6c4cc9c22f3; c18bca1dd6745c45e80df2f9c1a20d486fba86ba; c09af1021d26210ba6a23a6a791c40c4fcc60e5c; d95880ef4cc92b928abb647b5e5575e62fb15275; 6409a317c2204f02b069a46d71952a73583ee1eb; 2187ae8c603788e23a77b0d437510a997a81ef10; d24b851d56e6896c564a97da6bd74a24f1d3b230; a8548c37ae5ef399d82140a109dabba5d3d3aac0; 5c5f578e3e1df6593ceb2c64e6a1992f41bcbb01; 45d1c533124e0f25829d8b6df8e32d2c03dfea13; 7777d2b0db35fee5f9e54f0f5812bc00c55ce350; cb5066c90f69672f0e0d94e87eff1f4b7a9aaa5a; a8f95c349d304cfb1560fe2d9b7206c4376b573c; 1ef70ff40b3b416f507546a2fd2c640a18e399b1; 41e85e33a543a4eee48446d2522c5688b6b02ce9,c9a61284568d2a1b5864c02097440ac8c34702c3; 63b447e6bd4b5f2a1942f12d8eb1146c788921fe; 0e4cafbe12b3759fb077f8593c6278a86718cdba; 2f2abf16fd202a9e38e2fd60c6179fff223beeb5; 6f8798a49f679700476199d671eeaafc0f8a253f; 0e54bcb5c44ff683ef5a03f7f0a1a18df6d80bd0; 470054d4809ed0730f8fb885b120e05280acd6f8; e7cb42e8a745379425b58ccd1fd583795fb3c861; 0fcdce1619130b139725b0142e4d0f4f76f05c83; b0b3a02901c04bb9469d4576eb81cdb6ee524672; 64836cc1e8d7da6fb198778ff3a633405c4fec68; 247982f4593ed3f21170633a16c82a50dc145d6d; d10aede64558871a79c63b15c232b1d75ae194f2; ca6b5abc8f5d53a292933ab5c32016e308128238; f86ad96a23794ea73d9b217ad08bdbf2c10817c8; 8acd6e9716c744b91307d942b11d893268388a67; 5c5f578e3e1df6593ceb2c64e6a1992f41bcbb01; 438f727d7366cdf81157f37b3446312dcd25cda7; d7350320c64a81d2cb92be3ecfcc49f1f6d9d757; de69b8ee04b8a88c4252f4e3af42f6f6258d4457; e61e480c2263626c2e5d41c9bbb31c39c96d78ee; cebaf23fd90935847883d92627b554208bb7ca85; 637772a386478ec2d267d0199e0b0c4d46ff6e42; d79231b8f1870c4e2bb228fdbe5806728bff4fa3; 563c864e65aca82af1e3eb6ab17fe6ee329efafd; 80e1798d59e1ec8252a25d656ac6db4545fedb3b; bb9e29c720f586f24748228794168fdd5924790c,Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation,9,48 - 48
a2f10e46db3842b974521907b0132d533e4eb963,The statistical power of inclusive composite interval mapping in detecting digenic epistasis showing common F2 segregation ratios.,"Epistasis is a commonly observed genetic phenomenon and an important source of variation of complex traits, which could maintain additive variance and therefore assure the long-term genetic gain in breeding. Inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) is able to identify epistatic quantitative trait loci (QTLs) no matter whether the two interacting QTLs have any additive effects. In this article, we conducted a simulation study to evaluate detection power and false discovery rate (FDR) of ICIM epistatic mapping, by considering F2 and doubled haploid (DH) populations, different F2 segregation ratios and population sizes. Results indicated that estimations of QTL locations and effects were unbiased, and the detection power of epistatic mapping was largely affected by population size, heritability of epistasis, and the amount and distribution of genetic effects. When the same likelihood of odd (LOD) threshold was used, detection power of QTL was higher in F2 population than power in DH population; meanwhile FDR in F2 was also higher than that in DH. The increase of marker density from 10 cM to 5 cM led to similar detection power but higher FDR. In simulated populations, ICIM achieved better mapping results than multiple interval mapping (MIM) in estimation of QTL positions and effect. At the end, we gave epistatic mapping results of ICIM in one actual population in rice (Oryza sativa L.).",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Luyan Zhang"", ids = ""47058849""); list(name = ""Huihui Li"", ids = ""2301326""); list(name = ""Jiankang Wang"", ids = ""2818519"")",fd71399984d8d64200c77c991b0b21798e2ef6a0; 4c1e6430d2bdbc3a4458f587db2b02b1c66116f6; 79085fc89d226a95d297d3aceefa86fccba6210f; 8ace20a97e97feb19db6dceca662a8d716bb0689; d6349cd7cd3ed87dc2dd8df021e5a72fb9bb6ded; 8d16b96d21af7b9428337bce289f85589b9e358c; 456e3a51bcb3d8619e84ee6d8a06fd1fe0ec9ac5; a1cc10c8aeb98aac26818bc8db7a53735cfaab98; 890776fbf59c5461acacada392bca64154331d4b; 0c5d5289e8e67c715f52f02d808eb906ff680786; a345d8c4282740c3bf7fd5fde2aa157f93a1d6a0; 7d6a3de38ba7d08f2455ae6fadcfef0aacd3f006,ee628eafa770118bff745fd2cf8578d53ff15d51; 67b7943dda1bb8b4ebfdd207b21577fb0b2f7670; 97a97c0e68e20f3cf831620cd5b3f2f0f8b54d1e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 06e15a6da368a59171fe7b9e3260884cfe7a208c; a4825065185a3ff8f9947e4e43517176f7ff9983; 8916f9f4246cc3f0b4cd6bc586843dc10334ed1d; f3705d195f2c9dd6ca3393f3bf114da705acc25c; 52dec54902c959eaad836f31312613f56e94d7ec; a2bcb55449480c278291fab3240e8f5dca9afc04; 3207aa2d240c50dc6d53d2955220014ad2560f7d; 02dae4f75c5c63ebc625722182703d74a066764c; 454c695144a30d4ff062bea03ced02ec6d6c7668; 40c9a4434a8da93c32b587984b9278483b2cb18a; 550a62aafa402963c9d399c2a37e2f4fdc157660; 4c46e38df39207635583315764ec8c1eee10b32b; 90eee03d575bd934fd7cd33884ab5b2a07c5b31a; 2fe4d7deb937d1c126c8981ba3a4d42871ff5ac3; 7b9c8fc1e7e353b1aac6dd02397f91d3da576a59,Journal of integrative plant biology,54 4,"

Eighty-six TB patients were examined to determine the peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations.ResultsWe newly identified an association between the haplotype [A-G-(insertion)-T] and susceptibility to pulmonary TB (p = 0.006, false discovery rate q = 0.072). TB patients with systemic symptoms had a lower -196 to -174 deletion/deletion genotype frequency than those without systemic symptoms (5.7% vs. 17.7%; p = 0.01). TB patients with the deletion/deletion genotype had higher blood NK cell counts than those carrying the insertion allele (526 vs. 243.5 cells/Î¼l, p = 0.009). TB patients with pleuritis had a higher 1350 CC genotype frequency than those without pleuritis (12.5% vs. 2.1%; p = 0.004). TB patients with the 1350 CC genotype had higher blood NK cell counts than those carrying the T allele (641 vs. 250 cells/Î¼l, p = 0.004). TB patients carrying homozygous short alleles for GT repeats had higher blood NK cell counts than those carrying one or no short allele (641 vs. 250 cells/Î¼l, p = 0.004).ConclusionsTLR2 genetic polymorphisms influence susceptibility to pulmonary TB.

d33236c7dd3c9ff4a32d6b3d14ce100e3b6971ce,Role of genetic variants of deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC) polymorphisms and esophageal and gastric cancers risk in Kashmir Valley and meta-analysis,"Genetic alterations in the deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC) gene have been a priori reported to associate with metastasis in variety of human cancers. We investigated the association between potentially functional SNPs in DCC and susceptibility to esophageal (EC) and gastric (GC) cancers in Kashmir Valley. We genotyped two SNPs DCC rs714 (A>G) and DCC rs2229080 (C>G) of DCC in 135 EC patients, 108 GC patients, and 195 controls matched by age and sex in Kashmir Valley by polymerase chain reactionâ€“RFLP method. Risk for developing EC and GC was estimated by binary logistic regression by using SPSS. We also performed a meta-analysis on DCC rs714 (A>G) and evaluated the association between the DCC rs714 (A>G) polymorphisms and cancer risk. A significant difference in DCC rs714 (A>G) genotype distribution between EC and GC cases and corresponding control groups was observed (odds ratio (OR)â€‰=â€‰1.92; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03; P-trendâ€‰=â€‰0.04; false discovery rate (FDR) Pcorrâ€‰=â€‰0.03: ORâ€‰=â€‰2.15; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02; P-trendâ€‰=â€‰0.01; FDR Pcorrâ€‰=â€‰0.03). But no such association was observed in DCC rs2229080 (C>G). Further, DCC rs714 (A>G) AA genotype showed significantly increased risk for both gastric squamous cell carcinoma (ORâ€‰=â€‰5.63; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02; FDR Pcorrâ€‰=â€‰0.01) and gastric adenocarcinoma (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.15; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02; FDR Pcorrâ€‰=â€‰0.01).

f5488adf355f422b5426adf566328ab316823cf4,On the discovery of significant statistical quantitative rules,"In this paper we study market share rules, rules that have a certain market share statistic associated with them. Such rules are particularly relevant for decision making from a business perspective. Motivated by market share rules, in this paper we consider statistical quantitative rules (SQ rules) that are quantitative rules in which the RHS can be any statistic that is computed for the segment satisfying the LHS of the rule. Building on prior work, we present a statistical approach for learning all significant SQ rules, i.e., SQ rules for which a desired statistic lies outside a confidence interval computed for this rule. In particular we show how resampling techniques can be effectively used to learn significant rules. Since our method considers the significance of a large number of rules in parallel, it is susceptible to learning a certain number of ""false"" rules. To address this, we present a technique that can determine the number of significant SQ rules that can be expected by chance alone, and suggest that this number can be used to determine a ""false discovery rate"" for the learning procedure. We apply our methods to online consumer purchase data and report the results.",2004,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Hong Zhang"", ids = ""46701933""); list(name = ""Balaji Padmanabhan"", ids = ""1997659""); list(name = ""Alexander Tuzhilin"", ids = ""1680593"")",906ad1c5828adf93773c6106cdf1f94d55c30b26; 401ff93573736a3dd577e4a8daae119a273138b3; 14b046fadd9d9286418a99a2d710c59987c38c7f; 848ff81ba1297d5a4574f6e17f2f2b1007bb6ecd; 49bd398e964e6d405812f15a977aa0ad4ee4f237; df346f5d6db044a743bad39f4ad4ec4bb0b0a92d; d4cd89259c754c86177fdb88fd1099dbb51767e4; 8b8faa7232d98ed14a6f23ca0f78485f38f840e3; 0762566420eb46f699cb468f534f552c536b442e; 342696fbc5f834cfc107314ad2c1e024d3fcc6fa; d53d97754a2fbb696899371860dfc368f86b2e99; da169d38bac62d6e542cb2e2ba3eb78a96e53f01; f433093ca124c1716ea8d655a852fe8da966df31; 86466b639babb77411b0fc2de908e22cf9661a47; 5bbc9323a354e0d6b16f300e30e3e9131bdd7bff; 70c8bea0d39b5c408e20a9ea44abd44cf0900999; 7ae0cd2cf4468f813b5eccff9557c30294faaa58; 0fe42265a9431eb0cb63f5ec6ac0965b1fe54c76; 98e6dae880db131d50f77354dc24434f86efb11f; 24572d38ae632a4c3b58dfb1588ebe630632a26f; 185cf18a66fe55300019978f3604ce39a7944de7; f4d21cefa5368a1db6019cb57653c3c43d43b404; 7b1abf2a3d078486157f215b7e192887c1df3e21; eea151ff89f8e6971fb1fbae79bba0479065923a; 65a3c1179d2e1d29cebef904740fa1c7f4070ac9; 7f78f0243bf16b467ea2d843b665ab13df84ec43; a0716a287d4cf1bf3463f513cc4b8049e8d7c3c1; bd6df469a5ce37fa5c50ffb2265a485976ebf1e3; 7f441b696434d960b86ba6629b19dad5a212a75b; 2bc0497af6dc333c3357c66d18db95a43f6d909b; 0c58a4f08d083782439b9b34905e9d9649011ed0; 0075873c38556b96d6f7c8de114688d3004e4bca; e6baba40bdc4a0a38735161fd32987206af83378; edb1fd534a081ae4ed697b138c5a03c8e4168886; ab5834baef51fef11a4aaa426e25d339a5ca4675; 5d195e086639bb6952fee4731936235099365dd8; 942fdfd703b3ebe764da35873a2eb633e269360c; 02d9329ae16ef046baaed969eb46b528fefd70cf; c82cf260fa18276ca5dcced48d8cae1ad3e1a7f0; d8bec4f81f70cd8be7ff5e1965af9ba853ada426; 32d1d24eda58b597a1a3e9d1926a06e47cd0d574; 8d4871b0618befc8849a622ddc76cb776300729e; ad095532ce3d8b35e78d31578173e907b1e438a8; aca66954810dd9a8332dfcbbf445901fa35144b2; 260bb1ea1cd006ec39b3f75cb1967efbad9ed893; 4a58f2a57be50e073ded342ef35a55bd035bbdb9; 12afd853eded7c6c8062c3a175e4e60322633f5f; 8cd1008662a542c20ac601f6296201faba3ba01d; 7d1ddf9821ca344bd8e9d56e5af4346c826cb691,c20ca1912675aca9f6af99d0b1137c03660cb666; e0b2e3f92eccb4100dfc592513cf636cd30986b3; 9ca1782482e049a569788fd569edb6866aa8d8be; 6d39111660fc2fb834d3ea5657b87d0d0e852283; 23665ae3af7bb4331417b8eb3a289ea5f70379dc; 1f9ede76dbbd6caf7e3877918fae0d421c6f180c; fff4d4262fbd294f769cf5e60e3216deb6238a06; 4ed3c548dc2769f04f0d109a32b28441bef32121; 040cf85e53e48aab1512ed8dd02d994eea0e4bcc; 48e276655e3d4d8f2de8c188a80e6304d428c386; d99a23040ce5ee3cce8f03af0cc3a27268fd775f; 8c70a0a39a686bf80b76cb1b77f9eef156f6432d; 60af0d7e6c0a987e2e51ea6ad31a664915bd41ae; 0c05f5561db187a3e24779b3b41aaab0e08febc9; 678691355d08e14be945e0cefcac130342967e54; c820c345664d39638aa2c6bab5b97fb1902ff418; 5a2f2dd40e9b6f638dfd9cb122c88a887191c19b; ccdffab933216ca53d3cf9f85859db64a11aa068; 9aa921b0203e06e98b49bf726a33e124f4310ea3; 8e084eb282c22b2385aee9f8492d0c95179a769d; 647545ff41d7b41bb4fe3e6ce56279417ea1663d; 8280285fd0b1c32df69f07082e27893132d2de8f; bc4af0ae74288049c89633eded5b10a739bcb4c6; 5074ceb346cfc5f5c139ac77ec359c8e1e83e029; 60cf25b0cf4354fab23f6d231ba1ffbf0c779306; d7203a27edddacbc573a29754bc192f7bedecaca; 24c70681e0e1f68810b753f32bcca266f8f47804; c0e989ffa41a1d46cdaa6354006d84b3a0039adb; bb63f7e39ebef20cdc6f71596eb4309e9dbf4816; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 99489748ff9d37ae2b3f31e5327d071e208fb284; dfff147bd9cecd78c8cd4b0dc26b179d9bfae1b3; e5a19a6728bff0e799f3518e0fb0354e8c3cc7d3; f16feccd56785a87233ebd3a3641f70a9aac63ac; 7cdd6a445ef0564e3051320cfd9eaba1287a16f6,,,374-383
b053db9e8364fd80df129d4d69127fbfe675efe9,"Hepatic genotoxicity and toxicogenomic responses in Mutaâ„¢Mouse males treated with dibenz[a,h]anthracene.","Dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DB[a,h]A) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon that is a by-product of combustion and a potent carcinogen. Few studies have investigated the effects of DB[a,h]A on mRNA and microRNA expression to dissect the mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis. In this study, mature male mice (Muta(â„¢)Mouse) were exposed to 6.25, 12.5 and 25mg/kg/day DB[a,h]A by oral gavage for 28 consecutive days. Results were compared with mice similarly exposed to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) in our previous work. Liver DNA adduct levels and lacZ mutant frequency increased dose dependently for both chemicals. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) potency was greater for DB[a,h]A than B[a]P using the chemical-activated luciferase expression assay. Microarray analysis revealed 19 up-regulated and 22 down-regulated genes (false discovery rate-adjusted P â‰¤ 0.05; fold change â‰¥ 1.5) following treatment with 6.25 mg/kg/day DB[a,h]A. Thirteen transcripts were up-regulated and 32 down-regulated in the 12.5mg/kg/day group. The 25mg/kg/day dose had major effects on mRNA expression with 135 up-regulated and 104 down-regulated genes. Overall, perturbations were greater for DB[a,h]A than for B[a]P; in vitro chemical-activated luciferase expression supports that this may be driven by the AhR. Many of the DB[a,h]A-affected genes are implicated in cancer and are essential in vital biological functions including circadian rhythm, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, immune response, cell cycle and apoptosis. Although a number of functional groups were similarly affected by B[a]P and DB[a,h]A, in general the responses generated by each chemical were quite distinct. Commonalities included a DNA damage response leading to induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in both Tp53-dependent and Tp53-independent manners. MicroRNA expression was identical for both chemicals, with only miR-34a showing a dose-dependent increase in treated mice.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Amal Malik"", ids = ""3436595""); list(name = ""Andrea Rowan-Carroll"", ids = ""1399514317""); list(name = ""Andrew Williams"", ids = ""145256918""); list(name = ""Christine L.

c192a7feb6b087b2af5e3040a2c762003a873744,Fast proximal gradient optimization of the empirical Bayesian Lasso for multiple quantitative trait locus mapping,"Complex quantitative traits are influenced by many factors including the main effects of many quantitative trait loci (QTLs), the epistatic effects involving more than one QTLs, environmental effects and the effects of gene-environment interactions. We recently developed an empirical Bayesian Lasso (EBlasso) method that employs a high-dimensional sparse regression model to infer the QTL effects from a large set of possible effects. Although EBlasso outperformed other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of power of detection (PD) and false discovery rate (FDR), it was optimized by a greedy coordinate ascent algorithm that limited its capability and efficiency in handling a relatively large number of possible QTLs. In this paper, we developed a fast proximal gradient optimization algorithm for the EBlasso method. The new algorithm inherits the accuracy of our previously developed coordinate ascent algorithm, and achieves much faster computational speed. Simulation results demonstrated that the proximal gradient algorithm provided better PD with the same FDR as the coordinate ascent algorithm, and computational time was reduced by more than 30%. The proximal gradient algorithm enhanced EBlasso will be a useful tool for multiple QTL mappings especially when there are a large number of possible effects.

946c8d1f614edddd667ce5e84ecfdcc2a5a9ca84,Prospective serum metabolomic profiling of lethal prostate cancer.,"Impaired metabolism may play an important role in the pathogenesis of lethal prostate cancer, yet there is a paucity of evidence regarding the association. We conducted a large prospective serum metabolomic analysis of lethal prostate cancer in 523 cases and 523 matched controls nested within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study. Median time from baseline fasting serum collection to prostate cancer death was 18â€‰years (maximum 30â€‰years). We identified 860 known biochemicals through an ultrahigh-performance LC-MS/MS platform. Conditional logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals of risk associated with 1-standard deviation (s.d.) increases in log-metabolite signals. We identified 34 metabolites associated with lethal prostate cancer with a false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.15. Notably, higher serum thioproline, and thioproline combined with two other cysteine-related amino acids and redox metabolites, cystine and cysteine, were associated with reduced risk (1-s.d. ORâ€‰=â€‰0.75 and 0.71, respectively; pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰8.2â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5 ). By contrast, the dipeptide leucylglycine (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.36, pâ€‰=â€‰8.2â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5 ), and three gamma-glutamyl amino acids (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.28-1.30, pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰4.6â€‰Ã—â€‰10-4 ) were associated with increased risk of lethal prostate cancer. Cases with metastatic disease at diagnosis (nâ€‰=â€‰179) showed elevated risk for several lipids, including especially the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), acyl carnitines, and dicarboxylic fatty acids (1.37â€‰â‰¤â€‰ORâ€‰â‰¤â€‰1.49, FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.15). These findings provide a prospective metabolomic profile of lethal prostate cancer characterized by altered biochemicals in the redox, dipeptide, pyrimidine, and gamma-glutamyl amino acid pathways, whereas ketone bodies and fatty acids were associated specifically with metastatic disease.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jiaqi Huang"", ids = ""3248829""); list(name = ""Alison M Mondul"", ids = ""6982949""); list(name = ""Stephanie J Weinstein"", ids = ""144804437""); list(name = ""Andriy Derkach"", ids = ""144041260""); list(name = ""Steven C.

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is a cornerstone in the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) due to its antiplatelet effect. Cessation of aspirin before coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is often recommended to avoid bleeding, but the practice is controversial because it is suggested to worsen the underlying CAD. The aims of the present prospective, randomized study were to assess if ASA administration until the day before CABG decreases the oxidative load through a reduction of inflammation and myocardial damage, compared with patients with preoperative discontinuation of ASA.


METHODS
Twenty patients scheduled for CABG were randomly assigned to either routine ASA-treatment (160 mg daily) until the time of surgery (ASA), or to ASA-withdrawal 7 days before surgery (No-ASA). Blood-samples were taken from a radial artery and coronary sinus, during and after surgery and analysed for 8-iso-prostaglandin (PG) F2Î±; a major F2-isoprostane, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), cytokines and troponin T. Left ventricle Tru-Cut biopsies were taken from viable myocardium close to the left anterior descending artery just after connection to cardiopulmonary bypass, and before cardioplegia were established for gene analysis (Illumina HT-12) and immunohistochemistry (CD45).


RESULTS
8-Iso-PGF2Î± at baseline (t1) were 111 (277) pmol/l and 221 (490) pmol/l for ASA and No-ASA, respectively (P = 0.065). Area under the curve showed a significantly lower level in plasma concentration of 8-iso-PGF2Î± and hsCRP in the ASA group compared with the No-ASA group with (158 pM vs 297 pM, P = 0.035) and hsCRP (8.4 mg/l vs 10.1 mg/l, P = 0.013). All cytokines increased during surgery, but no significant differences between the two groups were observed. Nine genes (10 transcripts) were found with a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.1 between the ASA and No-ASA groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Continued ASA treatment until the time of CABG reduced oxidative and inflammatory responses. Also, a likely beneficial effect upon myocardial injury was noticed. Although none of the genes known to be involved in oxidative stress or inflammation took a different expression in myocardial tissue, the genetic analysis showed interesting differences in the mRNA level. Further research in this field is necessary to understand the role of the genes.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kirsti Berg"", ids = ""36423390""); list(name = ""Mette Langaas"", ids = ""2899111""); list(name = ""Madelene Ericsson"", ids = ""48580984""); list(name = ""Hilde Pleym"", ids = ""5545576""); list(name = ""Samar K.

We previously reported an association between lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) (16:1) and risk for type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population using an untargeted analysis.


Objective
To examine the overall associations of LPIs and their related metabolites, such as nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and acylcarnitines, with incident and prevalent type 2 diabetes using a targeted approach.


Design and Setting
A case-control study was nested within the Singapore Chinese Health Study. Cases and controls were individually matched by age, sex, and date of blood collection. We used both liquid and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to measure serum metabolite levels at baseline, including 8 LPIs, 19 NEFAs, and 34 acylcarnitines. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between metabolites and diabetes risk.


Participants
Participants included 160 incident and 144 prevalent cases with type 2 diabetes and 304 controls.


Main Outcome Measure
Incident and prevalent type 2 diabetes.


Results
On the basis of a false discovery rate <0.1, we identified 37 metabolites associated with prevalent type 2 diabetes, including 7 LPIs, 18 NEFAs, and 12 acylcarnitines, and 11 metabolites associated with incident type 2 diabetes, including 2 LPIs and 9 NEFAs. Two metabolites, LPI (16:1) and dihomo-Î³-linolenic acid, showed independent associations with incident type 2 diabetes and significantly enhanced the risk prediction.


Conclusions
We found several LPIs and NEFAs that were associated with risk for type 2 diabetes and may improve our understanding of the pathogenesis. The findings suggest that lipid profiles could aid in diabetes risk assessment in Chinese populations.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yonghai Lu"", ids = ""5299508""); list(name = ""Yeli Wang"", ids = ""8896337""); list(name = ""Li Zou"", ids = ""144124140""); list(name = ""Xu Liang"", ids = ""145688789""); list(name = ""Choon Nam Ong"", ids = ""1840860""); list(name = ""Subramaniam Tavintharan"", ids = ""4168682""); list(name = ""Jian-Min Yuan"", ids = ""144178673""); list(name = ""Woon-Puay Koh"", ids = ""41178490""); list(name = ""An Pan"", ids = ""145651229"")",e9a556cf0678599e9ecb61525fca04ce6ae02679; 926f707d89d5a22c0bd07e045e41729ccfcb596e; a776e832d55402493f7048bbb5ca7f02c22bea17,aeef897da96a19a3594133c7a802c972fc483a04; ca20e5b7753115d597080e14d648922bac14bf14; d22ea1506bb6721f486ec24ffe5bc69bb3178495; b2ac296fb95264fb7ae9a657aae4778e3170f794; 3e4db62d1bbec4918df3cc96b41b158462c7d512; a58f57b3d0de5ceda2303068746834dcca3962bf; 43d1f04b4bd3f19d00cacc52837a8efc300f66a0; 667f5db5394899c763f5f70c8175cb796556f1df; 1e547da5a14e2c19fbf687527bf7d4b8b45f24fc; e1b05657968cbbc65e286312fe5b0e18da4be5ed; ca25ad343ab035e48142ea3fe424984d472ff4a2; d9d13d80c1c6ab55e8c6f689b3d91397cbc36be1; 88304425981a2e32f39a8a5f1e777af055c665cc; b0cadcb7c6d13c1ffe08dca97af0a14ebbdfe3cc; 71022474c1f8516be5e38c5c4089c4e4f2136a8b; 71824ff0ac86faf9905e0c1ceb160cf10d8f0da0; 92e8e73f1547df17a1240017de20667e89326bfe; 1b657091f114377bae2f58fd2874b8ff952c9e8c; cd7d7153784ccaf64a32eb7359fc59924365f69b; f54d6b11d3ed9af847bddc1d530ecb8152e1db6c; ec9dea494bc1c67fe901380f8264518759ddb4e2; 4b3a5612b477148ef6df871922eb434c24870572; e689b25086dac5402257b499fa304b9fd8eb1514; f43be8478a8b631eae04fad4cc28d7dcb6dc8379; e3d058b228b82f333b4de9eb9d5531d4465aae49; ee61b6526fc9dfc05df7f8bb42e1fa8cb0dcc7ff; f412466ec6cb80676f55171e54ddac160a85c87a; 8f6b2ed0a68a7afddd0b5fe53c4e9b77bd9e7d64; 0890be0b26e3d5657dbe013803059e045ba75e1e,The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism,103,671â€“680
15022fff37fe1ea0aca48c5de2c1c77e313d9f1f,Investigations on genomic meta-analysis: imputation for incomplete data and properties of adaptively weighted fisher's method,"Microarray analysis to monitor expression activities in thousands of genes simultaneously has become a routine experiment in biomedical research during the past decade. The microarray expression data generated by high throughput experiments may consist thousands variables and therefore pose great challenges to the researchers in a wide variety of objectives. A commonly encountered problem by researchers is to detect genes differentially expressed between two or more conditions and is the major concern of this thesis. 
In the first part of the thesis, we consider imputation of incomplete data in transcriptomic meta-analysis. In the past decade, a tremendous amount of expression profiles are generated and stored in the public domain and information integration by meta-analysis to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes has become popular to obtain increased statistical power and validated findings. Methods that combine p-values have been widely used in such a genomic setting, among which the Fisher's,Stouffer's, minP and maxP methods are the most popular ones. In practice, raw data or p-values of DE evidence of the entire genome are often not available in genomic studies to be combined. Instead, 
only the detected DE gene lists under certain p-value threshold (e.g. DE genes with p-value< 0.001) are reported in journal publications. The truncated p-value information voided the aforementioned meta-analysis methods and researchers are forced to apply less efficient vote counting method or naively drop the studies with incomplete information. In the thesis, effective imputation methods 
were derived for such situations with partially censored p-values. We developed and compared three imputation methods (mean imputation, single random imputation and multiple imputation) for a general class of evidence aggregation methods of which Fisher, Stouffer and logit methods are special examples. The null distribution of each method was analytically derived and subsequent inference and genomic analysis framework were established. Simulations were performed to investigate the type I error and power for univariate case and the control of false discovery rate (FDR) for (correlated) gene expression data. The proposed methods were also applied to several genomic applications in prostate cancer, major depressive disorder MDD), colorectal cancer and pain Research. 
In the second part, we investigate statistical properties of adaptively weighted (AW) Fisher's method. The traditional Fisher's method assigns equal weights to each study, which are simple in nature but can not always achieve high power for a variety of alternative hypothesis settings. Intuitively more weights should be assigned to the studies with high power to detect the difference between different conditions. The AW-Fisher's method, where the best binary 0=1 weights were determined by minimizing the p-value of the weighted test statistics. By using the order statistics technique, the searching space for adaptive weights reduces to linear complexity instead of exponential, which reduced the computational complexity dramatically, and a close form was derived to compute the p-values for K = 2, and an importance sampling algorithm was proposed to evaluate the p-values for K>2. Some theoretical properties of the AW-Fisher's method such as consistency and asymptotical Bahadur optimality (ABO) have also been investigated. Simulations 
will be performed to verify the asymptotical Bahadur optimality of the AW-Fisher and compare the performance of AW-Fisher and Fisher's methods. 
Meta-analysis of multiple genomic studies increases the statistical power of biomarker detection and therefore the work in this thesis could improve public health by providing more effective methodologies for biomarker detection in the integration of multiple genomic studies when the information is incomplete or when different hypothesis settings are tested.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Shaowu Tang"", ids = ""1947112"")",,a5e82ee0621f35bc3c1123dfbba32bad9932ef4d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4d9c6f46b8f3f53e99f85cefb53c5ff450914d76; a81f0dcf0ba0b575ac6c3540a1394af9765b9ed9; 9eb8ae39a3f7788a0fbc9b16c48de4489e5b952f; 3b4562258fc281a3123d59088d10e46e49eb9028; 046c42bc3080850701ec72edd552485fdad4ff8e; cea31b10645107419ffd20adf9b083e13349d10c; 0496072c54d336ab07b47fe52b15eebb9b57472a; 67db62c833ca56f802c19b97e0a1fd72eb127c45; 13e1a7a5a68bd149d79203020767acc454872392; 4b1054f633ff312eb4ee142b5150dd748145260e; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; ec018270bc112a04f019f5ddc641fe323678849a; 3c2824ab6d4fc4da7ccb3253ce122d75a78627a0,,,
b3fa6615b0fb42ddeb49116d9a6a50d61c24bb9c,MicroRNA expression in B-cell lymphomas,"Accurate lymphoma diagnosis, prognosis and therapy still require additional markers. 
Additionally, some aspects of lymphoma pathogenesis are still partially unexplained. 
In this work the potential relevance of microRNA (miRNA) expression in a large series of cases that included all major B-cell lymphoma types has been investigated. 
First, a series of 147 fresh frozen lymphomas and 15 controls were inspected for their miRNA expression profile. This analysis yielded a signature of 128 miRNAs that enabled the characterization of the different B-cell lymphoma types. Then a second series of cases was used to corroborate the differential expression of selected miRNAs vs. non-tumour controls. 
The viability of using miRNAs as additional markers for differential diagnosis has been investigated by comparing Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) vs. Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and resulted in the identification of 19 significant miRNAs (False Discovery Rate < 0.05). 
Not only: the correlation between miRNA expression profiles, gene expression profiles and pathway activation was examined in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), suggesting the implication of different miRNAs in pathway regulation. In particular, loss of miR-26a may contribute to NFkB pathway activation. 
Furthermore the clinical prognostic value of miRNAs has been examined in MCL cases, where miR-20b was identified as a good candidate for overall survival stratification of the patients. 
Finally, selected miRNAs were sequenced to test the presence and the relevance of miRNA sequence variation in a series of 95 DLBCL cases. 
In summary this work identifies good candidate miRNAs that might be used to better recognise the different B-cell lymphoma types (especially BL and DLBCL), and other miRNAs that could contribute to lymphoma pathogenesis elucidation.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Lorena Di Lisio"", ids = ""7471557"")",9022e33ca50065ccfc2fad92e1e773d19bc714ff,3700340b608ead1b6a895f5bc9a90fece5cb2080;

B 57 (1995) 289) and Benjamini and Liu (J. Statist. Plann. Inference 82 (1999) 163) proposed step-up and step-down multiple hypotheses testing procedures, respectively, for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) when all the test statistics are independent. In this paper, we propose another step-up procedure such that the FDR is still controlled at a specified significance level.

f5b2c2ccb0e4e99ac7ab7ef01b8b31902d89f25e,Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis ï¼š A Skeleton in the Cupboard of Adult Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies.,"OBJECTIVE
To clarify the prevalence, risk factors, outcome and outcome-related factors of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in patients with dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM) or clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM).


METHODS
Data of patients with DM, PM or CADM who were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University (FAHZJU) from February 2011 to February 2019 were retrospectively collected. Patients diagnosed with HLH constituted the case group. A 1:4 casecontrol study was performed to identify risk factors for HLH in patients with DM, PM or CADM through comparison, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Intragroup comparison was made within HLH patients to identify factors influencing unfavorable short-term outcome.


RESULTS
HLH was a rare (4.2%) but fatal (77.8%) complication in patients with DM, PM or CADM. The retrospective case-control study revealed that higher on-admission disease activity (P=0.008), acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease (AE-ILD, P=0.002) and infection (P=0.002) were risk factors for complication of HLH in patients with DM, PM or CADM. The following intragroup comparison showed that higher on-admission disease activity (P=0.035) and diagnosis of CADM (P=0.039) might influence the short-term outcome of HLH patients. However, no risk factor was identified after false discovery rate correction.


CONCLUSION
In this study, secondary HLH was a fatal complication with higher on-admission disease activity, AE-ILD and infection working as risk factors. The underlying role of infection and autoimmune abnormality in HLH in connective tissue disease (CTD) was subsequently brought up. Clinical factors influencing the short-term outcome of patients with secondary HLH required further exploration.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Junyu Lianga"", ids = ""1382552774""); list(name = ""Danyi Xu"", ids = ""5930440""); list(name = ""Chuanyin Sun"", ids = ""7799250""); list(name = ""Weiqian Chen"", ids = ""2643535""); list(name = ""Heng Cao"", ids = ""145036097""); list(name = ""Jin Li-na"", ids = ""1379640049"")",,,The Journal of rheumatology,,
4397e0a00fd0deb9284d3017aad8acd112c18129,Modular network construction using eQTL data: an analysis of computational costs and benefits,"BACKGROUND
In this paper, we consider analytic methods for the integrated analysis of genomic DNA variation and mRNA expression (also named as eQTL data), to discover genetic networks that are associated with a complex trait of interest. Our focus is the systematic evaluation of the trade-off between network size and network search efficiency in the construction of these networks.


RESULTS
We developed a modular approach to network construction, building from smaller networks to larger ones, thereby reducing the search space while including more variables in the analysis. The goal is achieving a lower computational cost while maintaining high confidence in the resulting networks. As demonstrated in our simulation results, networks built in this way have low node/edge false discovery rate (FDR) and high edge sensitivity comparing to greedy search. We further demonstrate our method in a data set of cellular responses to two chemotherapeutic agents: docetaxel and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and identify biologically plausible networks that might describe resistances to these drugs.


CONCLUSION
In this study, we suggest that guided comprehensive searches for parsimonious networks should be considered as an alternative to greedy network searches.",2014,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yen-Yi Ho"", ids = ""49993629""); list(name = ""Leslie M.

3ef8f6fcb3f6d3374335c3ff34a4a32cab82486a,A novel method of differential gene expression analysis using multiple cDNA libraries applied to the identification of tumour endothelial genes,"BackgroundIn this study, differential gene expression analysis using complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries has been improved. Firstly by the introduction of an accurate method of assigning Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) to genes and secondly, by using a novel likelihood ratio statistical scoring of differential gene expression between two pools of cDNA libraries. These methods were applied to the latest available cell line and bulk tissue cDNA libraries in a two-step screen to predict novel tumour endothelial markers. Initially, endothelial cell lines were in silico subtracted from non-endothelial cell lines to identify endothelial genes. Subsequently, a second bulk tumour versus normal tissue subtraction was employed to predict tumour endothelial markers.ResultsFrom an endothelial cDNA library analysis, 431 genes were significantly up regulated in endothelial cells with a False Discovery Rate adjusted q-value of 0.01 or less and 104 of these were expressed only in endothelial cells. Combining the cDNA library data with the latest Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) library data derived a complete list of 459 genes preferentially expressed in endothelium. 27 genes were predicted tumour endothelial markers in multiple tissues based on the second bulk tissue screen.ConclusionThis approach represents a significant advance on earlier work in its ability to accurately assign an EST to a gene, statistically measure differential expression between two pools of cDNA libraries and predict putative tumour endothelial markers before entering the laboratory.

e5cc6c23fb62556feadea68707e482c43182c4e0,"Proteomics, ultrastructure, and physiology of hippocampal synapses in a fragile X syndrome mouse model reveal presynaptic phenotype.","Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of hereditary mental retardation, is caused by a loss-of-function mutation of the Fmr1 gene, which encodes fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP affects dendritic protein synthesis, thereby causing synaptic abnormalities. Here, we used a quantitative proteomics approach in an FXS mouse model to reveal changes in levels of hippocampal synapse proteins. Sixteen independent pools of Fmr1 knock-out mice and wild type mice were analyzed using two sets of 8-plex iTRAQ experiments. Of 205 proteins quantified with at least three distinct peptides in both iTRAQ series, the abundance of 23 proteins differed between Fmr1 knock-out and wild type synapses with a false discovery rate (q-value) <5%. Significant differences were confirmed by quantitative immunoblotting. A group of proteins that are known to be involved in cell differentiation and neurite outgrowth was regulated; they included Basp1 and Gap43, known PKC substrates, and Cend1. Basp1 and Gap43 are predominantly expressed in growth cones and presynaptic terminals. In line with this, ultrastructural analysis in developing hippocampal FXS synapses revealed smaller active zones with corresponding postsynaptic densities and smaller pools of clustered vesicles, indicative of immature presynaptic maturation. A second group of proteins involved in synaptic vesicle release was up-regulated in the FXS mouse model. In accordance, paired-pulse and short-term facilitation were significantly affected in these hippocampal synapses. Together, the altered regulation of presynaptically expressed proteins, immature synaptic ultrastructure, and compromised short-term plasticity points to presynaptic changes underlying glutamatergic transmission in FXS at this stage of development.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Patricia Klemmer"", ids = ""47806098""); list(name = ""Rhiannon M.

16e92f6681b4e41dac596fa99daddc11d2d6b728,Disturbed Brain Activity in Resting-State Networks of Patients with First-Episode Schizophrenia with Auditory Verbal Hallucinations: A Cross-sectional Functional MR Imaging Study.,"Purpose To investigate auditory verbal hallucination (AVH)-specific patterns of brain activity within the resting-state networks (RSNs) that have been proposed to underpin the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia (SZ). Materials and Methods This cross-sectional study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants prospectively recruited. Independent component analysis was used to investigate RSNs in 17 patients with first-episode untreated SZ with AVHs, 15 patients with SZ without AVHs, and 19 healthy control subjects who underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Dual regression was implemented to perform between-group analysis. Regional brain function was then explored within RSNs by using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation. Two-sample t tests were used to compare regional brain function between the two patient groups, and Pearson correlation analysis was used to characterize the relationship between imaging findings and severity of AVHs. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of these brain function measures. Results Independent component analysis demonstrated symptom-specific abnormal disrupted coactivation within the auditory, default mode, executive, motor, and frontoparietal networks and was pronounced in the auditory cortex, supramarginal gyrus, insula, putamen, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, angular gyrus, precuneus, and thalamus (P < .05 with false discovery rate correction). Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation analysis demonstrated similar patterns within these RSNs (P < .05 with false discovery rate correction). Furthermore, a positive correlation between the degree of coactivation within the motor network and the severity of AVHs was observed in patients with SZ with AVHs (r = 0.67, P = .003). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.76-0.90 for all RSNs. Conclusion These findings indicate that dysfunctional brain regions are involved in auditory processing, language production and monitoring, and sensory information filtering in patients with SZ with AVHs, which may be helpful in furthering the understanding of pathophysiological correlates of AVHs in SZ.

A Voxel-Based Analysis of Brain Spect Imaging.,"Sickle cell diseases (SCD) are characterized by the presence of hemoglobin S, hemolytic anemia and vascular occlusion. Silent infarcts in SCD patients is strongly associated with an increased stroke risk and progressive cognitive decline. In this study we used 99mTc-ECD single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in order to detect early abnormalities of brain perfusion in neurologically asymptomatic adult SCD patients. We recruited 42 SCD (27 females and 15 males, mean age of 33.4Â±10.55, range 17â€“60 years) from the Hematology and Hemotherapy Center of the University of Campinas.The SCD types were distributed as follows: 33 HbSS (14 males and 19 females), 6 HbSC (1 male and 5 females) and 3 HbSBeta (3 females). Mean steady state hemoglobin level measured in the period of up to 2 weeks before or after imaging acquisition was 8.5g/dl (Â±1.73; 5.2â€“13.5) and mean hematocrit was 25.1% (Â±4.85; 15.6â€“38.5). The group of patients with SCD was compared to a group of control healthy subjects (29 females and 20 males with mean age 31 years Â±8; 25â€“49) recruited within the local community, who were submitted to the same imaging protocol used in the patients.The study was approved by the National Ethical Committee Board and informed-write consent was obtained from all patients. The inclusion criteria for this study was to be at least 17 years old, have a precise clinical and laboratory diagnosis of any SCD, do not have stroke previously and be on regular follow-up in the clinic. All of them were submitted to a standard protocol of brain SPECT image acquisition. Reconstructed transaxial datasets were converted into ANALYZE format and corrected for the orthogonal plane of acquisition using MRIcro software. Voxel-based analysis was performed using SPM2 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology). Images were spatially normalized to standard anatomical template defined in the atlas of Talairach and Tournoux. The normalized smoothed images underwent group comparison of regional tracer uptake using paired t-test. Contrasts were defined in order to estimate the probability of each voxel to have an increased or decreased tracer uptake in images from patients with SCD compared to images from the normal control group. Reduced tracer uptake was observed in many areas of the brain when compared to normal controls. These areas corresponded predominantly to watershed regions and other brain areas supplied by micro vasculature. We observed a reduced tracer uptake in the central basal forebrain, which includes the basal ganglia and thalami, the anterior frontal region and the watershed region of the temporo-parietal-occipital transition. These regions are to be considered the most significant hypoperfused areas (false discovery rate correction of p<0.05).The findings of our study demonstrate that neurologically asymptomatic SCD patients exhibit a pattern of reduced 99mTc-ECD tracer uptake demonstrated by SPECT. Early diagnosis of such cerebral vasculopathy has prognostic implications and can be determinant in considering therapeutic alternatives to avoid increasing in brain lesion load and progressive disability.",2004,Medicine,"list(name = ""Leonardo Deus-Silva"", ids = ""1421802583""); list(name = ""Leonardo Bonilha"", ids = ""3330620""); list(name = ""Allan de Oliveira Santos"", ids = ""145370769""); list(name = ""Elba Etchebehere"", ids = ""49747185""); list(name = ""Regis Oquendo-Nogueira"", ids = ""1422336150""); list(name = ""Renata Fockink"", ids = ""5747810""); list(name = ""Edwaldo Eduardo Camargo"", ids = ""33166222""); list(name = ""Li Min Li"", ids = ""32659789""); list(name = ""Fernando Cendes"", ids = ""144366417""); list(name = ""Benedito P.

7a2f942da549b7dfe6ff28fb1f123994b26d5a7d,Detecting virus integration sites based on multiple related sequencing data by VirTect,"BackgroundSince tumor often has a high level of intra-tumor heterogeneity, multiple tumor samples from the same patient at different locations or different time points are often sequenced to study tumor intra-heterogeneity or tumor evolution. In virus-related tumors such as human papillomavirus- and Hepatitis B Virus-related tumors, virus genome integrations can be critical driving events. It is thus important to investigate the integration sites of the virus genomes. Currently, a few algorithms for detecting virus integration sites based on high-throughput sequencing have been developed, but their insufficient performance in their sensitivity, specificity and computational complexity hinders their applications in multiple related tumor sequencing.ResultsWe develop VirTect for detecting virus integration sites simultaneously from multiple related-sample data. This algorithm is mainly based on the joint analysis of short reads spanning breakpoints of integration sites from multiple samples. To achieve high specificity and breakpoint accuracy, a local precise sandwich alignment algorithm is used. Simulation and real data analyses show that, compared with other algorithms, VirTect is significantly more sensitive and has a similar or lower false discovery rate.ConclusionsVirTect can provide more accurate breakpoint position and is computationally much more efficient in terms both memory requirement and computational time.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yuchao Xia"", ids = ""6391522""); list(name = ""Yun Liu"", ids = ""39798475""); list(name = ""Minghua Deng"", ids = ""1709706""); list(name = ""Ruibin Xi"", ids = ""2338289"")",d1bdc3beb792621ff7602cb2472716cbc3e97ca6; 56ba9fdea5d0b17a719c5fe4d08b6d26e12e59c6,e44b5f85d7b6c827dbeb6b125bdcbf5790774e30; 7876067a76ab9eca6ecd4cd513ff51238c91bf81; 425a537f6a898a11f3ab3c2e015ca9e42cbaf11f; c92788c06327144174acb293c8cb517212a069a2; ca46d763f1be9cc293c00f9bcdebb42a77fb7c9e; b4da5cc2676b86904a898490fc1c0a86906983d8; 571f5bbecd3a083a2bb6844f59a3f8cea237252e; d31f2a2f8dbf56eb90fe787074bc17e7a4a8be2d; 5a285e00abff841930f3b5d33ca936ac8bfb00b9; 72b72ea713217e12bfbd98da37860ef81e87f523; a5cd1a73534959eff5332bcd3e5bc012f38c9137; 141458d8a02c2244d75308b22fe48380a90c3e91; 14a82ef10b74e5dd4153add7f0f4b90b687d7724; 4a74bdc08e0f1bfd7b1c47b3e4dcea5d35b99c84; e045b4c95f22ca1690112b7509d68189a60a5700; 43546f35f8853dbaab3232a9561254a506ea53bb; 20125fc071617ad6621e3ba92d747cc22b9575b3; 974980fd0261a8ea76e65107277c2cd4e4019f47; 503a28508dbefa2694fb46aac68452cce6bfed60; 36535c6dab35982e6e85563a13291c1c1cd9e6a3; 48560ad1f0588732834759e4c358bf14784ed04f; cdb91f039a0e7f5fde482d930f2acab358758691; 62fa257968ecaedbf7dac5efe1593a31b5c0bf24; 6ac177cb2144f7271f4a7bf524a50c2ea96fffa8; 878092ff00d71a70adc15fbf7ca65d1de34488b5; a863d1b45ee7f5f855e4247d97840891c8a317ab; bfa9da21de8896272d4cc4b6da8ab8eac4da2fcf; 3224e37fefc1c3b5da369784ecec6506606fd630; 4602429c4fc1b3bfcb846c0b977f42515f35bf6f,BMC Medical Genomics,12,

Despite the critical importance of proper evaluation and interpretation of the results generated by these algorithms there is still little consistency in their application or understanding of their similarities and differences. A survey was conducted of four tandem mass spectrometry peptide identification search algorithms, including Mascot, Open Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm, Sequest, and X! Tandem. The same input data, search parameters, and sequence library were used for the searches. Comparisons were based on commonly used scoring methodologies for each algorithm and on the results of a target-decoy approach to sequence library searching. The results indicated that there is little difference in the output of the algorithms so long as consistent scoring procedures are applied. The results showed that some commonly used scoring procedures may lead to excessive false discovery rates. Finally an alternative method for the determination of an optimal cutoff threshold is proposed.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Brian M.

56a8579f9bfef37932b646ee42323f78282a4173,Controlling the multiplicity using weighted T-sum statistic.,"We introduce a new test procedure for multiple hypothesis testing based on the permutation space of the sum of test-statistics (t-sum). The underlying combining function is shown to be an instance of a family to which it also belongs the well-known combining functions based on the maximum of test-statistics (t-max). After discussing the family-wise error rate and the false discovery rate, two common approaches to the control of the type I error in multiple testing, we consider two further error rates, the stochastic family error and the mean square error model fit estimator. By means of a two large set of simulations we shoe that besides controlling the family-wise error rate the weak sense, the t-sum procedure also controls the stochastic family error and could considerably outperform the t-max procedure in power and mean square error in experiments with low degrees of freedom. They are also shown several circumstances in which it fits the model better than a procedure controlling the false discovery rate and even better of simply performing a series of univariate tests, which do not control any errors. The t-sum procedure is suitable for pilot and exploratory studies in neuroimaging and in other experimental contexts in which the sample size/number of hypotheses ratio is low, the data correlation is moderate, and the proportion of false hypothesis is possibly large. We end the discussion outlining possible investigations of the more general form of combining function (weighted sum) with the aim of data-driven selection of an optimal poewer combining function.",2003,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Marco Congedo"", ids = ""3276441""); list(name = ""Livio Finos"", ids = ""2340811""); list(name = ""Federico E.

13634b77c469cd0a40f3afbbe8ccb851708fc219,Abstract 2006: Genome-wide study of DNA methylation alterations in response to pesticide exposure inin vitro,"Pesticides are widely used in the US and worldwide, and are pervasive in our environment. All pesticides sold in the US have passed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) screening procedures for carcinogenicity based on their genotoxicity and mutagenicity. However exposure to pesticides among pesticide applicators and manufacturing workers has repeatedly been shown to increase cancer risk, suggesting that pesticides may cause cancer via alternative mechanisms, such as epigenetic changes. The purpose of the present study is to examine whether exposure to organophosphate pesticides (OPs), a group of the most commonly used pesticides in the US, induces DNA methylation alterations in in-vitro. The K562 progenitor blood cell line was exposed to several OPs (i.e., chlorpyrifos, diazinon, fonofos, malathion, parathion, phorate, and terbufos) at different dosages and time periods. DNA was prepared from samples exposed to ethanol (control) and a range of pesticide concentrations similar to exposure levels experienced by the US licensed pesticide applicators. We conducted genomewide DNA methylation analysis using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip that covers 27,578 individual promoter CpG sites in the entire genome. The relative level of methylation was calculated as the ratio of signal from a methylated probe relative to an unmethylated probe. Bayesian-adjusted t-tests were used to identify differentially methylated sites. A cut-off of False Discovery Rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value (q-value) 2 was used to identify candidate CpG sites. We observed significant differences in genomewide DNA methylation patterns in relation to exposure to three pesticides (i.e., fonofos, parathion, and terbufos) that have been associated with cancers in human studies. Out of all genes with differentially methylated CpG site(s) for each of the three pesticides, we identified 712 genes (625 were hypermethylated and 87 were hypomethylated) overlapped for these three pesticides. Gene ontology analysis showed that these hyper- or hypo-methylated genes are implicated in carcinogenesis and related biological process, such as tumor protein p53 inducible protein 11 (TP53I11) (4.0-fold for fonofos, 4.7-fold for parathion, 3.1-fold for terbufos, respectively), growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible gamma (GADD45G) (25.2-fold for fonofos, 23.1-fold for parathion, 31.2-fold for terbufos, respectively), and interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R1) (âˆ’2.2-fold for fonofos, -2.1-fold for parathion, -2.2 fold for terbufos, respectively). Our results provided direct experimental evidence that pesticides can modify DNA methylation in gene promoter CpG sites, which may play pathological role in cancer development. Further studies in other cell types and human samples are required before any firm conclusion could be reached on the significance of pesticide-induced methylation.

2def5ea8b905c5742e989279f14bab82e560a07e,Large-Scale Simultaneous Hypothesis Testing: The Choice of a Null Hypothesis,"Current scientific techniques in genomics and image processing routinely produce hypothesis testing problems with hundreds or thousands of cases to consider simultaneously. This poses new difficulties for the statistician, but also opens new opportunities. In particular, it allows empirical estimation of an appropriate null hypothesis. The empirical null may be considerably more dispersed than the usual theoretical null distribution that would be used for any one case considered separately. An empirical Bayes analysis plan for this situation is developed, using a local version of the false discovery rate to examine the inference issues. Two genomics problems are used as examples to show the importance of correctly choosing the null hypothesis.",2004,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Bradley Efron"", ids = ""47537846"")",8530f24753460c35a4b0324a6e75067195995737;

e4b48633e87c34384624d1c2e8b57afcfb7e2568,The Effect of Gestational Age on Angiogenic Gene Expression in the Rat Placenta,"The placenta plays a central role in determining the outcome of pregnancy. It undergoes changes during gestation as the fetus develops and as demands for energy substrate transfer and gas exchange increase. The molecular mechanisms that coordinate these changes have yet to be fully elucidated. The study performed a large scale screen of the transcriptome of the rat placenta throughout mid-late gestation (E14.25-E20) with emphasis on characterizing gestational age associated changes in the expression of genes involved in angiogenic pathways. Sprague Dawley dams were sacrificed at E14.25, E15.25, E17.25 and E20 (n = 6 per group) and RNA was isolated from one placenta per dam. Changes in placental gene expression were identified using Illumina Rat Ref-12 Expression BeadChip Microarrays. Differentially expressed genes (>2-fold change, <1% false discovery rate, FDR) were functionally categorised by gene ontology pathway analysis. A subset of differentially expressed genes identified by microarrays were confirmed using Real-Time qPCR. The expression of thirty one genes involved in the angiogenic pathway was shown to change over time, using microarray analysis (22 genes displayed increased and 9 gene decreased expression). Five genes (4 up regulated: Cd36, Mmp14, Rhob and Angpt4 and 1 down regulated: Foxm1) involved in angiogenesis and blood vessel morphogenesis were subjected to further validation. qPCR confirmed late gestational increased expression of Cd36, Mmp14, Rhob and Angpt4 and a decrease in expression of Foxm1 before labour onset (P<0.0001).

e0e91b00908f3e8b0ccf054127f8c29f1ec1851a,A practical guide to methods controlling false discoveries in computational biology,"BackgroundIn high-throughput studies, hundreds to millions of hypotheses are typically tested. Statistical methods that control the false discovery rate (FDR) have emerged as popular and powerful tools for error rate control. While classic FDR methods use only p values as input, more modern FDR methods have been shown to increase power by incorporating complementary information as informative covariates to prioritize, weight, and group hypotheses. However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another. We investigate the accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six modern FDR-controlling methods by performing a systematic benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case studies in computational biology.ResultsMethods that incorporate informative covariates are modestly more powerful than classic approaches, and do not underperform classic approaches, even when the covariate is completely uninformative. The majority of methods are successful at controlling the FDR, with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings. Furthermore, we find that the improvement of the modern FDR methods over the classic methods increases with the informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses.ConclusionsModern FDR methods that use an informative covariate provide advantages over classic FDR-controlling procedures, with the relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of available covariates.

0abd2b0f53f701ecdb0190d34ca088f04fd322c5,A variable selection method for genome-wide association studies,"MOTIVATION
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving half a million or more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) allow genetic dissection of complex diseases in a holistic manner. The common practice of analyzing one SNP at a time does not fully realize the potential of GWAS to identify multiple causal variants and to predict risk of disease. Existing methods for joint analysis of GWAS data tend to miss causal SNPs that are marginally uncorrelated with disease and have high false discovery rates (FDRs).


RESULTS
We introduce GWASelect, a statistically powerful and computationally efficient variable selection method designed to tackle the unique challenges of GWAS data. This method searches iteratively over the potential SNPs conditional on previously selected SNPs and is thus capable of capturing causal SNPs that are marginally correlated with disease as well as those that are marginally uncorrelated with disease. A special resampling mechanism is built into the method to reduce false positive findings. Simulation studies demonstrate that the GWASelect performs well under a wide spectrum of linkage disequilibrium patterns and can be substantially more powerful than existing methods in capturing causal variants while having a lower FDR. In addition, the regression models based on the GWASelect tend to yield more accurate prediction of disease risk than existing methods. The advantages of the GWASelect are illustrated with the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) data.

Today, these data most often originate from mass spectrometryâ€“based shotgun proteomics experiments. In this review, we survey computational methods for the analysis of such proteomics data, focusing on the explanation of the key concepts. Starting with mass spectrometric feature detection, we then cover methods for the identification of peptides. Subsequently, protein inference and the control of false discovery rates are highly important topics covered. We then discuss methods for the quantification of peptides and proteins.

b060176f39bab184976ba3374006e2f507a33cf8,Tailor: non-parametric and rapid score calibration method for database search-based peptide identification in shotgun proteomics.,"Peptide-spectrum-match (PSM) scores used in database searching are calibrated to spectrum- or spectrum-peptide-specific null distributions. Some calibration methods rely on specific assumptions and use analytical models (e.g. binomial distributions), whereas other methods utilize exact empirical null distributions. The former may be inaccurate because of unjustified assumptions, while the latter are accurate, albeit computationally exhaustive. Here, we introduce a novel, non-parametric, heuristic PSM score calibration method, called Tailor, which calibrates PSM scores by dividing them with the top 100-quantile of the empirical, spectrum-specific null distributions (i.e. the score with an associated p-value of 0.01 at the tail, hence the name) observed during database searching. Tailor does not require any optimization steps or long calculations; it does not rely on any assumptions on the form of the score distribution (i.e. if it is e.g. binomial); however, it relies on our empirical observation that the mean and the variance of the null-distributions are correlated. In our benchmark, we re-calibrated the match scores of XCorr from Crux, HyperScore scores from X!Tandem, and the p-values from OMSSA with Tailor method, and obtained more spectrum annotations than with raw scores at any false discovery rate level. Moreover, Tailor provided slightly more annotations than E-values of X!Tandem and OMSSA and approached the performance of the computationally exhaustive exact p-value method for XCorr on spectrum datasets containing low-resolution fragmentation information (MS2) around 20-150 times faster. On high-resolution MS2 datasets, the Tailor method with XCorr achieved state-of-the-art performance, and produced more annotations than the well-calibrated Res-ev score around 50-80 times faster.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Pavel Sulimov"", ids = ""46237638""); list(name = ""Attila KertÃ©sz-Farkas"", ids = ""1399953812"")",,,Journal of proteome research,,
430cbddbddebf944ee27a98f1e04ace5614f71d6,Bimodal plasma metabolomics strategy identifies novel inflammatory metabolites in inflammatory bowel diseases.,"INTRODUCTION
Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) characterized by variable phenotypes. Metabolites are signatures of biochemical activity that can reveal unknown pathogenic pathways. We employed untargeted mass spectrometry (MS) based metabolomics to identify novel inflammatory mechanisms in IBD and a targeted assay to quantify metabolites of the auto-immunomodulating kynurenine pathway (KP) in IBDs and health.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Metabolome analysis of CD, UC, and control plasmas was performed on a Liquid Chromatography (LC)-MS/MS system. KP metabolites quinolinic acid (QA) and picolinic acid (PA) were quantified by gas chromatography/MS.


RESULTS
Nineteen UC, 25 CD, and 9 control plasmas were analyzed: 34 metabolites exhibited abundance profiles associated with CD by global metabolome analysis (Pâ‰¤0.05, false discovery rate qâ‰¤0.01). Notably, inflammatory-implicated metabolites angiotensin IV (P=0.049, q<0.001), diphthamide (P=0.018, q<0.001), and GM3 gangliosides (P<0.001, q<0.001) were increased in CD. By targeted kynurenine metabolites assay, QA (73.53 ng/mL Â± 23.40 SD) and combined kynurenine metabolites (CKM) were increased in CD (120.19 Â± 39.71) compared to controls (QA 50.14 Â± 15.04; P<0.01; CKM 92.73 Â± 26.30; P<0.01). CD QA positively correlated with CDAI (r=0.85; P<0.01), CRP (r=0.46; P=0.01), and ESR (r=0.42; P=0.03), while CKMs correlated with CDAI (r=0.615; P<0.01) and CRP (r=0.615; P=0.02).


CONCLUSIONS
Associations of angiotensin IV, diphthamide, and GM3 gangliosides with CD implicate novel pathways in activating a Th1/Th17 inflammatory profile. Increased QA concentrations in CD may indicate a defective auto-immunomodulation mechanism.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yunki Y Yau"", ids = ""38389279""); list(name = ""Rupert W L Leong"", ids = ""2346156""); list(name = ""Sean Seunghun Shin"", ids = ""11467974""); list(name = ""Sonia Bustamante"", ids = ""48605167""); list(name = ""Russell Pickford"", ids = ""145326823""); list(name = ""Leila Hejazi"", ids = ""5310675""); list(name = ""Beth Robin Campbell"", ids = ""48797110""); list(name = ""Valerie C Wasinger"", ids = ""6875985"")",f9330c1abfdb0c677d7c3f9f80679250204e06c3; 68340777a7bbb011844b137192345379acace177; 7c9acbc6cac9decd8062dd2a15a4a48ef2e1515a; 2cf53f58e32ae31ff046b6bdbb11c1e40db9da93; 6ac6c51101e89711b69508d80b6969229b4c279d,,Discovery medicine,18 98,"

f2d8586a4dd537a2b9050e85a4518d97f27d8cb2,Peptide separation methodologies for in-depth proteomics in Arabidopsis.,"In the post-genome era, several tools that have increased our global understanding of the molecular basis of several cell-based phenomena have been developed. However, proteomics has not been efficiently integrated with the other 'omics' (e.g. transcriptomics and metabolomics), because of the relatively low number of proteins identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Peptides from low-abundance proteins are often not detected by MS due to ionization suppression. To improve the number of peptide identifications in MS analyses, we propose three separation methodologies; namely, OFFGEL electrophoresis, 2D-liquid chromatography (LC) and the long monolithic silica-C18 capillary column method, with the common aim to decrease peptide complexity prior to MS analyses. Proteomics using the above three peptide separation methods were separately applied to protoplasts collected from the epidermal cell layer of Arabidopsis roots using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. In each method alone, 1,132, 836 and 795 proteins were specifically identified, respectively. This has allowed the identification of 1,493 proteins with no redundancy and with <1.0% false discovery rate. Moreover, approximately two-thirds of these proteins are identified here for the first time in the epidermal cell layer. These results show that use of different proteomic approaches can increase the total number of proteins identified. We propose that the integration of data from these methodologies represents a powerful tool for generation of proteome maps by enabling identification of low-abundance proteins in the various Arabidopsis root cell layers.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yoichiro Fukao"", ids = ""4291318""); list(name = ""Masami Yoshida"", ids = ""47222664""); list(name = ""Rie Kurata"", ids = ""122635528""); list(name = ""Mami Kobayashi"", ids = ""4193430""); list(name = ""Miyako Nakanishi"", ids = ""10348068""); list(name = ""Masayuki Fujiwara"", ids = ""40329796""); list(name = ""Keiji Nakajima"", ids = ""4641115""); list(name = ""Ali Ferjani"", ids = ""143874077"")",3a31c25cad6ccb22cf12525d6de8d09c15deb786; 11687b4463ab3abc6a356d98b98c868b1c3cb9d9; ea94cc55a7c41d82562dcb3891806a7472c4b393; 2674327fe9d328a0045ce30b9da2f224958c42e3; 08062ad9fd39d4fe6a9d069b85277fb6424db1e5; b6a07d50f8222ccfe5a0a85ccdb66af07609a837; 9882d3e4a0056553666a67157764396c92fbae40; bcc50b22f205329f76bd2c5b3fa31b7c61279e2a; a41fc55f10a09a1a282a7a2425f0314bb59f6968; 3b3fc1ef1495ab0f66c8f663666bc6535f201532,32a478cc9abca24cda422a0d85f3998a015fb000; c3260dd411166e5cf564ee24b4be460cce33e97e; 05317913045cd4ef1dd476e2e7e7822cb5d2e858; b9f78c8ee3c16d163b35fa5be75a2dcc6b5e5340; e3479db7a3d93a6522abc0e75e3de9464874335a; 9c4192367d312805e4a34b5c9081a75959eb6f2d; a7dcc03051a063a5412cecaa87c03745070a1b7f; dbaf3ae140e1ff09721b89168c50bd1ddaa3e6d3; 1a285ebc2003a572544c476adf525912da5ed548; b534c62461c9849d2e29f66158e3316bb6c6447a; fb0a645eae02bb966c5b8dc2a8b9b82be98f6fb5; 33a280e4a5c427d5dcf5bb69a094eeed36b54e7d; 7a9a6efc8b53e8a7d5cbcba8b9f982441c655a42; ad192d5ae8277b6804ebc5b730b2eb8ca7c3ddf0; f0a1a656ed2e24085c1fd54b7f669aaabf765145; 6a32bd8b182fc8dc6f74dc0de43a0dbb950687ce; fb6c62e8588e9a9b5eb306eda2a3559a9a595557; 70de56ab97ec598e6a0d4ca2c65c2357f29d430f; d5e4af592db756545ebbf892912676ead536ca0a; 7415c348b5da274bc26e81c96f5f0a84e1a7177b; df240ae02730855feec46da4df0fc45d455e1ebd; a672d12f0671d0a587f6da8209564ab69baa0d47; f4073646b976e33bd64441807abb7a7dae869bee; a99e1b6fc150202fccd6c0c5ed1e341bd270546f; e9dbd42c6b2a5146901fc5f2871ff388db192507; 777bc5f3402d15f970df7f022eca71601180c9ca; 3a96bcc648623c87429788a8d50da603080ff1e3; 476cb8852884c41aa841c6795ab42e74b2dd2782; 89b2074aa7e93e0895653281fac5e391e89f3eeb; ecf8af06a2b42192877fc789ed9d7031ec2f16b8; fe1a3058174ea28e698affd1880484bcb95f6a4f; 99cb2cc358d0a5bb7228b8aed006884d848f92d2; 6792a0820f649b4a5b5d3409469236dad246a080; 27e973bb2642556dc58833cba20615b8e8de681d; e9668f8c50c3884219398b68da0acac1f3da8794; ec6456d3f015de090733c2659dc568dc8c41dc28; 59b206a56927aa2644eed3b5108f6146ff4bbcaa; eedd164c9c86db9bed6ba77734494f0b7084ad01; 232ec8cd1a8afe53556c448597a9bef98ca4a1b3; 3c20310b69beaa753620fc010da1b64b58f3cfba; 609cfddb88fe196acd659be2285c3ff94560ca93; ca18b2b134d8dbf178045d388eec00a3bb24d67b; c042124e994bcdf0732e9ce04d36ccea9c62f6d4; 919ccbc7bf462e5abf79777eea5715bee8ccc558; b8f6a92827de5f9ba4734bea8265119000139958; 61b2113654131a48a61631b888d4ced45e7d0026; f7923e4fcbe8271eccf35d8074ac4d8e36fac87f,Plant & cell physiology,54 5,"

3a2bd8c5ded8baaaa7a316f73dd4b391d20c0634,A new INDEL detection strategy based on feature extraction,"Insertions and deletions (indels) are important structural variations in the human genome. Many researchers have created effective detection algorithms; however, the results include a significant amount of false discovery. Increasing the accu- racy of indel detection schemes remains a challenge. As coverage has increased, existing methods such as Pindel generate high false-discovery rates, owing to the number of reads. In order to resolve this problem, we present a new indel detection strategy. Our strategy uses related variation features, and combines the Pindel and Adaboost algorithms based on feature extraction. We utilized data from the internationally recognized 1000 Genomes Project for our simulations. The experimental results show that the new strategy effectively increases upon the accuracy of the single indel detection algorithm, and reduces the false discovery rate of the Pindel detection results.",2015,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Fei Qi"", ids = ""46534309""); list(name = ""Jing-Yang Gao"", ids = ""3133245"")",,,J.

330e1de09103c795ce504825de4029d6703afdb1,Mechanisms for rescue of corpus luteum during pregnancy: gene expression in bovine corpus luteum following intrauterine pulses of prostaglandins E1 and F2Î± â€ ,"Abstract In ruminants, uterine pulses of prostaglandin (PG) F2Î± characterize luteolysis, while increased PGE2/PGE1 distinguish early pregnancy. This study evaluated intrauterine (IU) infusions of PGF2Î± and PGE1 pulses on corpus luteum (CL) function and gene expression. Cows on day 10 of estrous cycle received 4 IU infusions (every 6 h; n = 5/treatment) of saline, PGE1 (2 mg PGE1), PGF2Î± (0.25 mg PGF2Î±), or PGE1 + PGF2Î±. A luteal biopsy was collected at 30 min after third infusion for determination of gene expression by RNA-Seq. As expected, IU pulses of PGF2Î± decreased (P < 0.01) P4 luteal volume. However, there were no differences in circulating P4 or luteal volume between saline, PGE1, and PGE1 + PGF2Î±, indicating inhibition of PGF2Î±-induced luteolysis by IU pulses of PGE1. After third pulse of PGF2Î±, luteal expression of 955 genes were altered (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.01), representing both typical and novel luteolytic transcriptomic changes. Surprisingly, after third pulse of PGE1 or PGE1 + PGF2Î±, there were no significant changes in luteal gene expression (FDR > 0.10) compared to saline cows. Increased circulating concentrations of the metabolite of PGF2Î± (PGFM; after PGF2Î± and PGE1 + PGF2Î±) and the metabolite PGE (PGEM; after PGE1 and PGE1 + PGF2Î±) demonstrated that PGF2Î± and PGE1 are entering bloodstream after IU infusions. Thus, IU pulses of PGF2Î± and PGE1 allow determination of changes in luteal gene expression that could be relevant to understanding luteolysis and pregnancy. Unexpectedly, by third pulse of PGE1, there is complete blockade of either PGF2Î± transport to the CL or PGF2Î± action by PGE1 resulting in complete inhibition of transcriptomic changes following IU PGF2Î± pulses. Summary Sentence Treatment with PGF2Î± induced dramatic changes in expression of 955 genes, based on RNA-Seq after the third PGF2Î± pulse (FDR < 0.01), whereas simultaneous treatment with pulses of PGE1 blocked luteolysis and gene expression induced by PGF2Î±.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""JuliÃ¡n Camilo Ochoa"", ids = ""11208754""); list(name = ""Francisco PeÃ± agaricano"", ids = ""1441028295""); list(name = ""Giovanni M.

4f682adc82e0cdb11b594c96b2c7a3272c0677bb,Characterization of peptides and proteins in commercial HSA solutions.,"HSA solutions account for 14% of the world market for plasma products. Albumin is indicated for reestablishing and maintaining circulatory volume in situations resulting from traumatic shock, surgery, or blood loss. Albumin is also used in extracorporeal liver support devices that perform blood dialysis against this protein. However, the protein composition of therapeutic albumin is only partially known. We performed an exhaustive analysis of albumin composition using a proteomic approach. Low abundance proteins and peptides in these samples were concentrated using a strong anion exchange resin. The absorbed material was eluted with a stepwise gradient of ammonium trifluoroacetate and the protein fraction was digested and analyzed by multidimensional liquid chromatography coupled to ESI-MS/MS using a linear ion trap. A total of 1219 peptides corresponding to 141 proteins different from albumin were identified with a false discovery rate <1%. Near 50% of these proteins have been described previously as forming part of the albuminome. Some of these proteins are proteases (kallikrein) or protease inhibitors (kininogen and SRPK1) or have relevant functions in cell surface adhesion (selectin, cadherins, and ICAMs) or in immunity and defense (molecules of the complement system and attractin).

30606cf3bbc5b7787979a8edfbf8fd2fd69059c1,Parafoveal thinning of inner retina is associated with visual dysfunction in Lewy body diseases,"BACKGROUND
Retinal optical coherence tomography findings in Lewy body diseases and their implications for visual outcomes remain controversial. We investigated whether region-specific thickness analysis of retinal layers could improve the detection of macular atrophy and unravel its association with visual disability in Parkinson's disease.


METHODS
Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (n = 63), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 8), and E46K mutation carriers in the Î±-synuclein gene (E46K-SNCA) (n = 4) and 34 controls underwent Spectralis optical coherence tomography macular scans and a comprehensive battery of visual function and cognition tests. We computed mean retinal layer thicknesses of both eyes within 1-, 2-, 3-, and 6-mm diameter macular discs and in concentric parafoveal (1- to 2-mm, 2- to 3-mm, 1- to 3-mm) and perifoveal (3- to 6-mm) rings. Group differences in imaging parameters and their relationship with visual outcomes were analyzed. A multivariate logistic model was developed to predict visual impairment from optical coherence tomography measurements in Parkinson's disease, and cutoff values were determined with receiver operating characteristic analysis.


RESULTS
When compared with controls, patients with dementia with Lewy bodies had significant thinning of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer complex within the central 3-mm disc mainly because of differences in 1- to 3-mm parafoveal thickness. This parameter was strongly correlated in patients, but not in controls, with low contrast visual acuity and visual cognition outcomes (P <â€‰.05, False Discovery Rate), achieving 88% of accuracy in predicting visual impairment in Parkinson's disease.


CONCLUSION
Our findings support that parafoveal thinning of ganglion cell-inner plexiform complex is a sensitive and clinically relevant imaging biomarker for Lewy body diseases, specifically for Parkinson's disease.

BH significance threshold of 0.05 was produced truly statistically significant coefficients to describe ER of two material systems. A group of plasma modified samples was chosen to be used for composite manufacturing to drive an assessment of interlaminar shear properties under static loading. Transversal and longitudinal electrical resistivity (DC, Ï‰ =0) of composite samples were studied to compare both the effects of CNT grafting and plasma modification on ER of resultant composites.",2017,Materials Science,"list(name = ""Hande Yavuz"", ids = ""153433780""); list(name = ""Jinbo Bai"", ids = ""48747337"")",,050ae47420affa36452e28c7367cf0b82a0f06d0; 5068d012e9c5cfd8427f8297e1401ac6ff136116; ccdd46d6e5953068670920d2ebef011fb797cc5b; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; dfbe4d110e648b9be9bdc43b6f8e8d5743add595; 367c302e8c6950b5d5ce79343661d1fa4f6d57d9; a61eb692776a5fc22e8bad222b0083e0dbb573fe; 9bcbae350202a221b5dfc1b547dd3da79cb6f57c; 089bc6feea590731abe2759c557fefb27e0d3b5b; 3f2e23f837e95132c6704c62bb1f2a7f08d8e8a8; 3bd471b0a8642d20e5a2e7cd664cbb926ea7adbf; 78d0be0b1f1fd695a2a32399574a4e93bf8c2d47; d0a2c421b395cc77bd43e7c351e8612114608197; 3dcff0514295902ae99a2582ab3549cc37fa8212; 543803c6f969dfb5bf83a98bd7917d9f6f7386c7; a71a05e9ab3e11979c783833a97b5e40d0435cb9; e271b57d7aca0dacda05689fc6a65b0af5640727; 63cedc6316eb42ea208118c24bfef04566266b81; ce2e4d7a88cf0ade4aae1466de91dca7ce36eaa6; 6fe269801ca44777385ba28230a68c70744ea969; 0a7a4a7310d59ae42b6df7e7b51253c89649864f; ac9044b0f9127210548f85930c54dedb8fbf1c47; 093537c7275e03e3fe133cad4994c6fb7302d46d; bd7e66c0a3245c23f0d5030a0d756529713e172a; 094435f6f316e1f0dea0dfc1335201538647be1c; 1f82f34d4898c59b3da98a22afb60dde8424d40c; b283d16a9346c8fc10a7f4de6f8cf007213b587a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 9e2d6ad4e00b82e27868f588fec068711b7811c8,Applied Composite Materials,25,661-674

4fa78a1b15e73469b3322e87437db1c274894d03,Comparing effect sizes across variables: generalization without the need for Bonferroni correction,"Studies in behavioral ecology often investigate several traits and then apply multiple statistical tests to discover their pairwise associations. Traditionally, such approaches require the adjustment of individual significance levels because as more statistical tests are performed the greater the likelihood that Type I errors are committed (i.e., rejecting H0 when it is true) (Rice 1989). Bonferroni correction that lowers the critical P values for each particular test based on the number of tests to be performed is frequently used to reduce problems associated with multiple comparisons (Cabin and Mitchell 2000). However, this procedure dramatically increases the risk of committing Type II errors as it results in a high risk of not rejecting a H0 when it is false. To reach 80% statistical power, it is necessary to have huge sample sizes to detect medium (r1â„4 0.3 or d 1â„4 0.5; sensu Cohen 1988) or small (r 1â„4 0.1 or d 1â„4 0.2; sensu Cohen 1988) strength effects (e.g., say N 1â„4 128 or N 1â„4 788, respectively, for a 2-sample t-test), but sample size is often limited when studying behavior. The strict application of Bonferroni correction in the field of ecology and behavioral ecology has therefore been criticized for mathematical and logical reasons (Wright 1992; Benjamini and Hochberg 1995; Perneger 1998; Moran 2003; Nakagawa 2004). As a potential solution, Wright (1992) and Chandler (1995) advocated that the sacrificial loss of power can be avoided by choosing an experimentwise error rate higher than the usually accepted 5%, which results in a balance between different types of errors. As another alternative, the researcher might be more interested in controlling the proportion of erroneously rejected null hypotheses, the socalled false discovery rate, than in controlling for familywise error rate (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Although this approach allows for increased power in large series of repeated tests, it is rarely applied in ecological studies (Garcia 2003, 2004). Recently, Nakagawa (2004) suggested reporting effect sizes together with confidence intervals (CIs) for all potential relationships to allow the readers to judge the biological importance of the results and to reduce publication bias. Due to the low power of the tests, the majority of investigated relationships are expected to be nonsignificant, which is thought to make publication difficult. Such difficulty is generally assumed to cause behavioral ecologists to selectively report data (Moran 2003; Nakagawa 2004). The omission of nonsignificant results from publications is undesirable for both scientific and ethical reasons, which makes Bonferroni adjustment problematic. It is noteworthy that direct tests comparing effect sizes of representative samples of published and unpublished studies showed no evidence of publication bias in the biological literature (Koricheva 2003; Moller et al. 2005). However, independent of publication bias, conclusions drawn from effect sizes and the associated CIs should be encouraged. Such an approach considers the magnitude of an effect on a continuous scale, whereas conventional hypothesis testing based on significance levels tends to treat biological questions as allor-nothing effects depending on whether P values exceed the critical limit or not (Chow 1988; Wilkinson and Task Force Stat Inference 1999; Thompson 2002). Hence, using the same data, the former approach may reveal that a particular effect is small, but still biologically important, whereas, the later approach may lead the investigator to conclude that the hypothesized phenomenon does not exist in nature. Although such philosophical differences may dramatically influence our knowledge, presenting standardized effect sizes is still uncommon in ecology and evolution (Nakagawa 2004). Here, I suggest that, in addition to their presentation, the calculated effect sizes may be further used in simple analyses that can help to estimate the true effect of a predictor variable and thus make general conclusions. These analytical tools rely on the fact that the strength and direction of relationships, as reflected by standardized measures of effect sizes (Pearsonâ€™s r, Cohenâ€™s d, or Hedgesâ€™ g), are comparable and independent of the scale on which the variables were measured (e.g., Hedges and Olkin 1985; Cohen 1988; Rosenthal 1991). Thus, if multiple traits are measured and multiple correlations are calculated, the corresponding effect sizes tabulated among the variables measured will have a certain statistical distribution with measurable attributes. Below, I present 4 simple analyses to demonstrate how such statistical attributes can be used to make general interpretations. I will confine myself to a typical sampling design from behavioral ecology in which the experimenter is interested in explaining variation in certain traits (response variables) in the light of other (predictor) variables. Specific sampling designs can be tailored according to the biological question at hand that will be illustrated by using real data on the collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis from Garamszegi et al. (2004). I will also discuss the confounding effect of colinearity between variables that may violate the assumption of statistical independence and the potentially low power of the suggested tests.",2006,Biology,"list(name = ""LÃƒÂ¡szlÃƒÂ³ Zsolt Garamszegi"", ids = ""88611248"")",9786896672fa2237f9ec69aa84476de0c013e80e;

1bcf0761d86e0f2750cbf370498f9f56575c0e70,Large-scale identification and visualization of human liver N-glycome enriched from LO2 cells,"Aberrant glycosylation has been commonly observed in various physiological and pathological disorders (including cancers), and quite a few glycoproteins have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as markers for early diagnosis. Each glycoprotein may have multiple glycoforms, and cancer-related ones can be only some specific glycoforms which have much higher sensitivity and specificity; for example, AFP glycoform AFP-L3 with N-glycan of 01Y(61F)41Y41M(31M41Y41L41S61M41Y41L41S is of bigger diagnostic value for hepatocellular carcinoma than total AFP (i.e., combination of all glycoforms). Mass spectrometry-based glycomics is currently the state-of-the-art instrumental analytical pipeline for high-throughput characterization of various glycoforms, where not only monosaccharide composition but also comprehensive structural information (sequence and linkage) of N-glycans are now reported thanks to our recently developed N-glycan database search engine GlySeeker. With this new capability, here, we report our large-scale characterization of human liver N-glycome with primary structures; 214 unique N-glycans with unique primary structures were identified and visualized with spectrum-level false discovery rate â‰¤Â 1% and number of best hits of 1. The LO2 N-glycans reported here serve as a basic reference for future liver N-glycome study, and further quantitative analysis will enable characterization of differentially expressed N-glycans and discovery of more effective markers for liver and other diseases.

11a78b45bff104c0ac84a2c5b5dc9f0394f32df4,AB0025 Proteomic analysis of anti-ccp immunoglobulins for the identification of rheumatoid arthritis patients requiring early aggressive treatment with anti-tnf,"Background Antibodies against citrullinated peptides (ACPA) are a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and are associated with poor outcome. ACPA are usually detected using the anti-CCP test, identifying antibodies against a broad spectrum of citrullinated antigens. Most citrullinated antigens however appear to be bystander antigens that are not thought to be involved in the disease process. While controversy remains over the identity of the pathogenic antigen, it has been hypothesized that the fine-specificity of the ACPA response in the patient harbors prognostic properties. Objectives The study aim is to analyze ACPA from early arthritis patients with a novel technique in order to show differences in the fine-specificity of these ACPA, and to test whether this information is predictive for the optimal treatment strategy in these patients. Methods We recently showed that the antibody response to a particular antigen results in rearranged immunoglobulin segments that are shared between individuals exposed to that antigen(1,2). In patients with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes, such sequences were found after proteomics analysis of affinity enriched immunoglobulins. In the current study, ACPA positive RA sera were drawn from 58 patients participating in the tREACH-study(3). This is a study with a protocolized treatment regime for patients with early RA aimed at obtaining low-disease activity (DAS Results Up to 1 Î¼g of CCP specific IgG was obtained from 180 Î¼l of serum. The LC-MS data was analyzed for correlations between ACPA derived peptides and the need for treatment with anti-TNF-Î± to control disease activity. However, no such correlations were found in excess of the false discovery rate in this dataset. In addition to ACPA, we also affinity purified rheumatoid factors from sera as a control. These preparations could be distinguished from the ACPA, suggesting our method performed appropriately. Conclusions Our experiments could not show a significant difference between anti-CCP antibodies in early RA sera from patients with different disease outcome. While this could indicate that anti-CCP fine-specificities are not associated with disease outcome, additional experiments are needed to interpret these results. In future work we will compare IgG with known affinity to subclasses of CCP antigens to verify that our technique distinguishes these more subtle differences in epitope specificity. In addition, it will be investigated whether fine specificity may affect the progression to arthritis in ACPA+ arthralgia patients. References VanDuijn, M. M., Dekker, L.

d7d2d671ab237afb234319b26260cb7b66e064bc,Evaluation of candidate genes in a genome-wide association study of childhood asthma in Mexicans.,"BACKGROUND
More than 200 asthma candidate genes have been examined in human association studies or identified with knockout mouse approaches. However, many have not been systematically replicated in human populations, especially those containing a large number of tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).


OBJECTIVE
We comprehensively evaluated the association of previously implicated asthma candidate genes with childhood asthma in a Mexico City population.


METHODS
From the literature, we identified candidate genes with at least 1 positive report of association with asthma phenotypes in human subjects or implicated in asthma pathogenesis using knockout mouse experiments. We performed a genome-wide association study in 492 asthmatic children aged 5 to 17 years and both parents using the Illumina HumanHap 550v3 BeadChip. Separate candidate gene analyses were performed for 2933 autosomal SNPs in the 237 selected genes by using the log-linear method with a log-additive risk model.


RESULTS
Sixty-one of the 237 genes had at least 1 SNP with a P value of less than .05 for association with asthma. The 9 most significant results were observed for rs2241715 in the gene encoding TGF-beta1 (TGFB1; P = 3.3 x 10(-5)), rs13431828 and rs1041973 in the gene encoding IL-1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1; P = 2 x 10(-4) and 3.5 x 10(-4)), 5 SNPs in the gene encoding dipeptidyl-peptidase 10 (DPP10; P = 1.6 x 10(-4) to 4.5 x 10(-4)), and rs17599222 in the gene encoding cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2; P = 4.1 x 10(-4)). False discovery rates were less than 0.1 for all 9 SNPs. Multimarker analysis identified TGFB1, IL1RL1, the gene encoding IL-18 receptor 1 (IL18R1), and DPP10 as the genes most significantly associated with asthma.


CONCLUSIONS
This comprehensive analysis of literature-based candidate genes suggests that SNPs in several candidate genes, including TGFB1, IL1RL1, IL18R1, and DPP10, might contribute to childhood asthma susceptibility in a Mexican population.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Hao Wu"", ids = ""2610469""); list(name = ""Isabelle ed Romieu"", ids = ""5414336""); list(name = ""Min Shi"", ids = ""143931949""); list(name = ""Dana B.

ce8b2886004c5c3b99e8f7a409fb3506fec0eb37,Widespread DNA hypomethylation at gene enhancer regions in placentas associated with early-onset pre-eclampsia,"Pre-eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy that can affect both maternal and fetal outcomes. Early-onset pre-eclampsia (EOPET) is a severe form of pre-eclampsia that is associated with altered physiological characteristics and gene expression in the placenta. DNA methylation is a relatively stable epigenetic modification to DNA that can reflect gene expression, and can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying such expression changes. This case-control study focused on DNA methylation and gene expression of whole chorionic villi samples from 20 EOPET placentas and 20 gestational age-matched controls from pre-term births. DNA methylation was also assessed in placentas affected by late-onset pre-eclampsia (LOPET) and normotensive intrauterine growth restriction (nIUGR). The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to assess DNA methylation at >480 000 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites. The Illumina HT-12v4 Expression BeadChip was used to assess gene expression of >45 000 transcripts in a subset of cases and controls. DNA methylation analysis by pyrosequencing was used to follow-up the initial findings in four genes with a larger cohort of cases and controls, including nIUGR and LOPET placentas. Bioinformatic analysis was used to identify overrepresentation of gene ontology categories and transcription factor binding motifs. We identified 38 840 CpG sites with significant (false discovery rate <0.01) DNA methylation alterations in EOPET, of which 282 had >12.5% methylation difference compared with the controls. Significant sites were enriched at the enhancers and low CpG density regions of the associated genes and the majority (74.5%) of these sites were hypomethylated in EOPET. EOPET, but not associated clinical features, such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), presented a distinct DNA methylation profile. CpG sites from four genes relevant to pre-eclampsia (INHBA, BHLHE40, SLC2A1 and ADAM12) showed different extent of changes in LOPET and nIUGR. Genome-wide expression in a subset of samples showed that some of the gene expression changes were negatively correlated with DNA methylation changes, particularly for genes that are responsible for angiogenesis (such as EPAS1 and FLT1). Results could be confounded by altered cell populations in abnormal placentas. Larger sample sizes are needed to fully address the possibility of sub-profiles of methylation within the EOPET cohort. Based on DNA methylation profiling, we conclude that there are widespread DNA methylation alterations in EOPET that may be associated with changes in placental function. This property may provide a useful tool for early screening of such placentas. This study identifies DNA methylation changes at many loci previously reported to have altered gene expression in EOPET placentas, as well as in novel biologically relevant genes we confirmed to be differentially expressed. These results may be useful for DNA- methylation-based non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of at-risk pregnancies.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""John D.

f9ba71704db0c70f3abfb4c5c5171be885ba9777,Bovine Mammary Gene Expression Profiling during the Onset of Lactation,"BACKGROUND
Lactogenesis includes two stages. Stage I begins a few weeks before parturition. Stage II is initiated around the time of parturition and extends for several days afterwards.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
To better understand the molecular events underlying these changes, genome-wide gene expression profiling was conducted using digital gene expression (DGE) on bovine mammary tissue at three time points (on approximately day 35 before parturition (-35 d), day 7 before parturition (-7 d) and day 3 after parturition (+3 d)). Approximately 6.2 million (M), 5.8 million (M) and 6.1 million (M) 21-nt cDNA tags were sequenced in the three cDNA libraries (-35 d, -7 d and +3 d), respectively. After aligning to the reference sequences, the three cDNA libraries included 8,662, 8,363 and 8,359 genes, respectively. With a fold change cutoff criteria of â‰¥ 2 or â‰¤-2 and a false discovery rate (FDR) of â‰¤ 0.001, a total of 812 genes were significantly differentially expressed at -7 d compared with -35 d (stage I). Gene ontology analysis showed that those significantly differentially expressed genes were mainly associated with cell cycle, lipid metabolism, immune response and biological adhesion. A total of 1,189 genes were significantly differentially expressed at +3 d compared with -7 d (stage II), and these genes were mainly associated with the immune response and cell cycle. Moreover, there were 1,672 genes significantly differentially expressed at +3 d compared with -35 d. Gene ontology analysis showed that the main differentially expressed genes were those associated with metabolic processes.


CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that the mammary gland begins to lactate not only by a gain of function but also by a broad suppression of function to effectively push most of the cell's resources towards lactation.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yuanyuan Gao"", ids = ""46636696""); list(name = ""Xueyan Lin"", ids = ""4823438""); list(name = ""Kerong Shi"", ids = ""4247036""); list(name = ""Zhengui Yan"", ids = ""6187881""); list(name = ""Zhonghua Wang"", ids = ""47196514"")",ac7075ef3d1949450ac37c6aaa78bcb60f924abf; 9d77b27f9bb2c80121c17253e95e95a20ab02d50; 3f096693918b819fb81eb5b064338f71650faa81; d409e57691bed22217ae667783777ebf97631bbf; ec6fa15d8b6ce14959b5453085ca1568213ebebb; 9169d87bc5cfbc45b138956707b9a821bbdaebea; 9b0a24f428b6de0605de12d21485bd8414732a66; a65520061b8c72d111dfd1ed3162cfc9825894c2; 6e35b8f6c39eb01724a3bb7d57eab27cd60156ac; 99164b08ce0a0f8a8d052757f4e704bdfcfe8af0; a0481d91cca95ae6dc0cdb8eaf094621e4b255ac; 2fca1cb85f5b54ea939df29a936dd28f74d14110; 335697f5d1aa7942d540f859bc5565b4e8fcc6fe; ca45dfecbc835998e22e017b3f56a692267fc5f1; 70c4a12c8b1ced60568c3b07739c4579db0f7219; 7f2719a25e2137e4b6156dba2650e59ffe6da1ae; e11847bbd090190e92aca9c70e32efab3ed8215d; 20a85fb2597378ad3d4b55b87b7b748f92a8b36b; b814ba6b3b0de29d8e3bb27d4ab0d743551c8c05; 9808aa41f330489bf7962a452d77352891320779; d8b246dd0cb6f17bffb941df96587cfc1e449118; fa079a284c3e15bb607097f3dd854768d77103ae,3dc6452dae2e25475173268341f04667e84747e3; 102b6a28b7512a1c6bb34bcd4d4b096597588d9b; ef546e351fb6dc0b366f174afc2308262980cbb7; 3543d4e97fc70c5c514d2a4393f84767b15b8640; 5609ac3dbba6f8ea35feb46fcb894d2b68ff90a9; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 4bfe125e82d74fb5027718c76c42d8f676fa2d5c; fc77573f8d90afd94623f6688f49bc4c40438100; 7b75eb247a3c12feeacfaf61a547b3c9368c288a; 7365c7c2aae639f68ec65fa98058a3bb2997ad55; 3d2fca8a0576e3c55f5c615731c09b6e24d22dd1; 46c2f5ed4c340253d908960d51d5d6df5fe17a1f; 1dbb2107625dd626a9e22d882c94e9cfb9ff3826; 265072c83a50edf88724184ede28f9e7f5ac699f; d0462481341976df81d6c16ca2e2f8d1f1599977; cbb08ecaaf7847c6696a73b59ba8a15996794084; e091e11bdae20a9df1f5ed6c8276ff894fda37c8; 15d63d21db8364fd35fdba15e99839ad54c49db8; 5da60059c776b5f236da410ab7427aa96d2f4f80; 8ccc444649b68ac97d7424aca0ed20591b7272d0; 478a0d9f1e3e41991cf47e4c1ef2a98153f0ef98; 58b48b7480e7f328336db4e75526034c357ab93f; 55557c0ebc71ff48881ef0c8531fc1bea4c28b5c; ac7ed3e5504e3e509aba9df54d0c0285535437ec; cadd8879f947ed294451683015b897b069c0dc6f; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; 0ccb8fba06fa8a0bcc8bbf43837bc1a0d23c2261; d9b3fb2de68f4f7e019d12acbc4cbcea0fd6a355; b75fdac5c3d4396e75184d85478314ac186e7b4f; c46e8acadf2f9bc44f44b5359709bdf8b6939a70; 7c624a2f6b3d5c4bc90c9d311458dba675571be7; 9d6fd33d223ebfe129fe39350da7642e6e5f7e3e; ec2c99ab0458980242ee642bb303e9d3bc599586; 372d3cce29164a00b160222fcbeacb084e621ffa; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; cde9b2658746892f0e19dd39b87b675bbd0777a4; 474e8ad5e4d187c77786da460baac65e62016f44; 04dabfa285ea75979d07432531abd6c061ee6807; fd747dd9b8d9ee84a09f172fee99b8ef73528489; df948b1f8fac6404728e3655a93a6df5f2892fdd; 45d0f1929fc2239d392937654b070058f75ac82f; ae711f7f96142ed489cb548702f1ba6159987de2; a7eab6aaa94f2b4bcb74fcff619aeed81547bf2c; 20cbe7521eb6358dc1319ffc05608b09676f114d; 04481ad41cc4e85e4065ea2f52302ef0faad3163; a310422e3e4c601e3906fabb3c3707175bdd25ef; a576dc5ca798496b341911b42d1a3bfa888af8e7; 55c6fba7bead54a4340c4d0d364e5cf4614dc60d,PLoS ONE,8,
ab30c422498b0877108ddfcdeaeeb8a0eef0d874,mRNA Expression Profiles from Whole Blood Associated with Vasospasm in Patients with Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,"Though there are many biomarker studies of plasma and serum in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), few have examined blood cells that might contribute to vasospasm. In this study, we evaluated inflammatory and prothrombotic pathways by examining mRNA expression in whole blood of SAH patients with and without vasospasm. Adult SAH patients with vasospasm (nâ€‰=â€‰29) and without vasospasm (nâ€‰=â€‰21) were matched for sex, race/ethnicity, and aneurysm treatment method. Diagnosis of vasospasm was made by angiography. mRNA expression was measured by Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays. SAH patients with vasospasm were compared to those without vasospasm by ANCOVA to identify differential gene, exon, and alternatively spliced transcript expression. Analyses were adjusted for age, batch, and time of blood draw after SAH. At the gene level, there were 259 differentially expressed genes between SAH patients with vasospasm compared to patients without (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05, |fold change|â€‰â‰¥â€‰1.2). At the exon level, 1210 exons representing 1093 genes were differentially regulated between the two groups (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.005,â€‰â‰¥â€‰1.2 |fold change|). Principal components analysis segregated SAH patients with and without vasospasm. Signaling pathways for the 1093 vasospasm-related genes included adrenergic, P2Y, ET-1, NO, sildenafil, reninâ€“angiotensin, thrombin, CCR3, CXCR4, MIF, fMLP, PKA, PKC, CRH, PPARÎ±/RXRÎ±, and calcium. Genes predicted to be alternatively spliced included IL23A, RSU1, PAQR6, and TRIP6. This is the first study to demonstrate that mRNA expression in whole blood distinguishes SAH patients with vasospasm from those without vasospasm and supports a role of coagulation and immune systems in vasospasm.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Huichun Xu"", ids = ""82162336""); list(name = ""Boryana Stamova"", ids = ""3587790""); list(name = ""Bradley P.

72520051e5174e478f7b2e8984586bff7cb19346,Identification of differentially-expressed genes between early-stage adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma lung cancer using meta-analysis methods.,"Lung adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell lung carcinoma (SCC) are two major subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Previous studies have demonstrated that fundamental differences exist in the underlying mechanisms of tumor development, growth and invasion between these subtypes. The investigation of differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) between these two NSCLC subtypes is useful for determining and understanding such differences. The present study aimed to identify those DEGs using meta-analysis and the data from four microarray experiments, consisting of 164 AC and 161 SCC samples. Raw gene expression values were converted into the probability of expression (POE) representing the differentially-expressed probability of a gene and expression barcode values representing its expression status. The results indicated that when applying a meta-analysis using barcode values, heterogeneity in genes across studies was less severe than when applying a meta-analysis using POE values. DEGs in each meta-analysis method overlapped substantially (P=1.3Ã—10-4), but the barcode method yielded a lower global false discovery rate.

6e6afce14c0b35e5a13f92efc8901b50645fdf64,Coplanar and coaxial orientations of RNA bases and helices.,"Electrostatic interactions, base-pairing, and especially base-stacking dominate RNA three-dimensional structures. In an A-form RNA helix, base-stacking results in nearly perfect parallel orientations of all bases in the helix. Interestingly, when an RNA structure containing multiple helices is visualized at the atomic level, it is often possible to find an orientation such that only the edges of most bases are visible. This suggests that a general aspect of higher level RNA structure is a coplanar arrangement of base-normal vectors. We have analyzed all solved RNA crystal structures to determine the degree to which RNA base-normal vectors are globally coplanar. Using a statistical test based on the Watson-Girdle distribution, we determined that 330 out of 331 known RNA structures show statistically significant (p < 0.05; false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.05) coplanar normal vector orientations. Not surprisingly, 94% of the helices in RNA show bipolar arrangements of their base-normal vectors (p < 0.05). This allows us to compute a mean axis for each helix and compare their orientations within an RNA structure. This analysis revealed that 62% (208/331) of the RNA structures exhibit statistically significant coaxial packing of helices (p < 0.05, FDR = 0.08). Further analysis reveals that the bases in hairpin loops and junctions are also generally planar. This work demonstrates coplanar base orientation and coaxial helix packing as an emergent behavior of RNA structure and may be useful as a structural modeling constraint.",2007,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Alain Laederach"", ids = ""49935631""); list(name = ""Joseph M.

b6ff701a8588d4d695c1ea687df86a4b0eb4c27b,Comparison of human platelet membrane-cytoskeletal proteins with the plasma proteome: Towards understanding the platelet-plasma nexus.,"Platelets are essential for maintaining vascular integrity. Given the anucleate nature of platelets, definition of their proteome is essential for understanding platelet pathophysiology. We describe here a detailed MS-based proteomic analysis of the platelet membrane/cytoskeletal sub-proteome from purified, normal, non-activated human platelets. In contrast to previous platelet proteomic purification strategies, the buffy-coat method was utilized in this study to isolate and purify minimally activated platelets, yielding significantly reduced contaminants for leukocytes (0.02â€…Â±â€…0.007Ã—10(6) /L) and erythrocytes (0.21â€…Â±â€…0.02%). Using a false discovery rate of 1%, 203 proteins were identified and characterized with respect to their subcellular localization, biological function, and cellular processes. Of these, 16 have not been identified in previous human platelet proteome studies. As a first approach towards understanding the dynamic platelet-plasma protein composition nexus, we re-analysed the entire HUPO plasma proteome project dataset (647 plasma proteins identified) and compared these data with our platelet proteome dataset. Co-identified proteins (41) were further analysed with respect to their relative abundances (exponentially modified protein abundance index) and functional enrichment in these two proteomes, as well as their correlation with the platelet transcriptome. Both platelet membrane/cytoskeletal and plasma proteome reference datasets, comprising both processed and unprocessed MS/MS spectra, are publicly accessible (http://www.ludwig.edu.au/archive/).",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""David W.

a94fb709f29171d9270aeda7c9d394c157cea5fe,Brain MR Imaging in Patients with Lower Motor Neuron-Predominant Disease.,"Purpose To investigate the patterns of cortical thinning and white matter tract damage in patients with lower motor neuron (LMN)-predominant disease compared with healthy control subjects and those with classic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to evaluate the relationship between brain structural changes and clinical and cognitive features in these patients. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the local ethical committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before enrollment. Twenty-eight patients with LMN-predominant disease were compared with 55 patients with ALS and 56 healthy control subjects. Patients underwent a clinical and neuropsychological assessment and T1-weighted and diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Surface-based morphometry was used to assess cortical thickness. Tract-based spatial statistics and tractography were used to study white matter tract damage. Results Patients with LMN-predominant disease did not show differences compared with healthy control subjects in cortical thickness and diffusion-tensor MR imaging metrics. Patients with ALS showed cortical thinning of the motor-related cortices and a distributed involvement of the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal gyri (P < .05, false discovery rate corrected). Patients with ALS also showed white matter damage along motor and extramotor tracts compared with control subjects and patients with LMN-predominant disease (tract-based spatial statistics: P < .05, family-wise error corrected; tractography: P values < .001 to .05, false discovery rate corrected). In patients with LMN-predominant disease, cognitive deficits correlated with alterations in diffusivity in the left cingulum (r = -0.66, P = .01) and superior longitudinal fasciculus (r = -0.65, P = .05). Conclusion Motor and extramotor cortical thinning and diffusion-tensor MR imaging alterations were specific for motor neuron disease phenotypes, with clinically overt upper motor neuron involvement.

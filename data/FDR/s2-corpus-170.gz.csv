19741d1b6274990647a618f9f4bdb817739da8b3,Enhanced Gene Expression of EZH2 In Patients with Primary Myelofibrosis,"Abstract 4118 

Introduction: The polycomb repressive complex (PRC) 2 contains 3 core proteins, EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), SUZ12, and EED, in which the SET (suppressor of vaegation-enhancer of zeste-trithorax) domain of EZH2 mediates the histone methyltransferase activity. This induces trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3, regulates the expression of HOX genes, and promotes proliferation and aggressiveness of neoplastic cells. EZH2, a known repressor of gene transcription, has been reported to be overexpressed in many cancers and correlates with poor prognosis. EZH2 may also be involved in disease progression in patients with the classical Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (CMPNs) encompassing essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Since the potential oncogenic role of EZH2 in CMPNs has never been investigated, we have assessed gene expression of EZH2 in a cohort of patients with CMPNs.

Patients and Methods: Using Affymetrix HG-U133 2.0 Plus microarrays, recognizing 54675 probe sets (38500 genes), gene expression profiling has been performed on control subjects (n=21) and patients with ET (n =19), PV (n=41), and PMF (n=9). All patients were diagnosed according to the WHO criteria of a CMPN. Total RNA was purified from whole blood and amplified to biotin-labeled RNA and hybridized to microarray chips.

Results: We identified 20439, 25307, 17417, and 25421 probe sets which were differentially expressed between controls and patients with ET, PV, PMF, and CPMNs as a whole, respectively (false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p values < 0.05). These genes included EZH2, which was highly significantly upregulated in patients with PMF as compared to controls (2.3 fold upregulated; uncorrected p-value=1.09Ã—10-8 and FDR=1.75Ã—10-6, and between PMF and non-PMF patients (fold change=2.0, FDR < 0.0005). No significant differences in EZH2 gene expression were recorded between controls and ET patients, controls and PV patients, or controls and the CMPN group as a whole. Within patients, the EZH2 gene was also differentially expressed with the highest levels being recorded in patients with PMF compared to PV patients (fold change=2.4, FDR < 7.5 Ã—10-6).

Discussion and Conclusions: Using global gene expression profiling we have found the EZH2 gene to be significantly upregulated in CMPN patients, with the highest expression levels being found in PMF. We hypothesize that an altered expression of EZH2 may be involved in the transformation of ET and PV into myelofibrosis. It remains to be clarified if deregulation of EZH2 occurs consequent to mutations in the EZH2-gene. Enhanced EZH2 expression may also be associated with silencing of differentiation genes during myelofibrotic and leukemic transformation. An increased expression of EZH2 may provide a proliferative advantage of the malignant clone through interaction with the pathways of key elements controlling cell growth arrest and differentiation, (e.g. nuclear factor kappa beta and - the proteasome pathway). Studies are in progress to elucidate if genomic loss of distinct microRNAs (microRNA 101 leads to overexpression of EZH2 in cancer is associated with overexpression of EZH2 in CMPNs. Highly expressed EZH2 may be a new marker of an aggressive clinical phenotype which might imply EZH2 as a novel biomarker for predicting prognosis. If so, EZH2-blockade might be a novel approach to be incorporated in the strategies for developing epigenetic therapies in patients with CMPNs.

This method is based on deconvolution of the hemodynamic response from the voxel time series assuming a linear response and using a ridge-regression algorithm. Statistical inference is performed by defining a spatio-temporal t-statistic and by controlling for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate procedure. The methodology was validated on five subjects who performed self-paced and visually cued finger tapping at 7 Tesla, with moderate (TR = 2 s) and high (TR = 0.4 s) temporal resolution. The results demonstrate that detection of single-trial BOLD events is feasible without a priori information on the stimulus paradigm. The proposed method opens up the possibility of designing temporally unconstrained paradigms to study the cortical response to unpredictable mental events.",2011,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""CÃ©sar Caballero Gaudes"", ids = ""7218642""); list(name = ""Natalia Petridou"", ids = ""145147883""); list(name = ""Ian L.

The determinants of weight loss following RYGB are poorly understood. Clinical factors have been able to account for only a fraction of the observed variation, and several studies have implicated additional biological determinants. In this study, we sought to determine the role of genetic contributions to weight loss after RYGB. Methods: We collected liver samples from 1018 patients undergoing RYGB. DNA from these samples was genotyped for 660,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Percent excess weight loss (%EWL) for the nadir weight after surgery was calculated against a reference BMI of 25 kg/m2. We identified 40 genetically related individuals within this cohort, based on percentage of their genome shared. Using electronic medical records, we identified 20 additional individuals who were cohabitating and genetically unrelated. We used mixed effects models to determine whether degree of relatedness (1Â°, 2Â°, or 3Â°, or cohabitating) is associated with%EWL. In addition, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the 789 non-related Caucasians within the total cohort. Results: The average difference in %EWL was 13.7%, 25.1% and 36.8% for 1Â°, 2Â°, and 3Â° relatives, and 25.4% for cohabitating individuals, respectively. There was a significant association of %EWL between 1Â° relatives (p=0.04, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient [ICC]=57.3%), which was not seen between 2Â° relatives (p=0.54, ICC=38.2%), 3Â° relatives (p=0.36, ICC=0%), or cohabitating individuals (p=0.53, ICC=0). The GWAS identified a single region on chromosome 6 that was significantly associated with %EWL (p=2.1x10-7; false discovery rate=9.2% for the highest ranked SNP in this region). Conclusions: These data suggest that there are genetic determinants of weight loss after RYGB. Despite the small number of related individuals, the significant correlation between outcomes of 1Â° relatives indicates that there is a significant genetic impact beyond any shared environmental influences. In addition, even in this modest-sized cohort, we identified a chromosomal region significantly associated with %EWL. These observations underscore the biological nature of the response to RYGB and suggest that variation in the genetic background of individuals influences weight loss after this operation. Identification of the genes involved in this response could provide information about the method of action of RYGB and facilitate strategies for selecting patients most likely to benefit from this effective yet invasive procedure.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ida J.

Materials and Methods: Design: Institutional prospective pilot study. Study population: 65 subjects (35 open-angle glaucoma patients, 30 normal patients). Observation procedures: One eye of each subject was included. SD-OCT was used to obtain 2D RNFL thickness values and 5 neuroretinal rim parameters [ie, 3D minimum distance band (MDB) thickness, 3D Bruchâ€™s membrane opening-minimum rim width (BMO-MRW), 3D rim volume, 2D rim area, and 2D rim thickness]. Main outcome measures: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values, sensitivity, and specificity. Results: Comparing all 3D with all 2D parameters, 3D rim parameters (MDB, BMO-MRW, rim volume) generally had higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values (range, 0.770 to 0.946) compared with 2D parameters (RNFL thickness, rim area, rim thickness; range, 0.678 to 0.911). For global region analyses, all 3D rim parameters (BMO-MRW, rim volume, MDB) were equal to or better than 2D parameters (RNFL thickness, rim area, rim thickness; P-values from 0.023 to 1.0). Among the three 3D rim parameters (MDB, BMO-MRW, and rim volume), there were no significant differences in diagnostic capability (false discovery rate >0.05 at 95% specificity). Conclusions: 3D neuroretinal rim parameters (MDB, BMO-MRW, and rim volume) demonstrated better diagnostic capability for primary and secondary open-angle glaucomas compared with 2D neuroretinal parameters (rim area, rim thickness). Compared with 2D RNFL thickness, 3D neuroretinal rim parameters have the same or better diagnostic capability.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kenneth C Fan"", ids = ""49593867""); list(name = ""Edem Tsikata"", ids = ""4867927""); list(name = ""Ziad Khoueir"", ids = ""152187949""); list(name = ""Huseyin Simavli"", ids = ""8323199""); list(name = ""Rong Guo"", ids = ""145290960""); list(name = ""Regina A. de Luna"", ids = ""1432722317""); list(name = ""Sumir Pandit"", ids = ""37273246""); list(name = ""Christian John Que"", ids = ""40415698""); list(name = ""Johannes F. de Boer"", ids = ""120328005""); list(name = ""Teresa C.

986345f39db1ea7dd64dfd52199ad352b9e8e656,Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Atrial Tissue of Patients Developing Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation.,"BACKGROUND
Mitochondria are the major site of cellular oxidation. Metabolism and oxidative stress have been implicated as possible mechanisms for postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after cardiac operations. Establishing the precise nature of mitochondrial dysfunction as an etiologic factor for oxidative stress-related cell death and apoptosis could further the understanding of POAF. To establish this relationship, mitochondrial function was studied in patients undergoing cardiac operations that developed POAF and compared it with patients without POAF.


METHODS
Right atrial tissue and serum samples were collected from 85 patients before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Microarray analysis (36 patients) and RNA sequencing (5 patients) were performed on serum and atrial tissues, respectively, for identifying significantly altered genes in patients who developed POAF. On the basis of these results, Western blot was performed in 52 patients for the genes that were most altered, and functional pathways were established.


RESULTS
POAF developed in 30.6% (nÂ = 26) of patients. Serum microarray showed significant fold changes in the expression of 49 genes involved in inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and amyloidosis (p < 0.05) in the POAF group. Similarly, RNA sequencing demonstrated an increased expression of genes associated with inflammatory response, fatty acid metabolism, and apoptosis in the POAF group (false discovery rate > 0.05). Immunoblotting showed a significant increase in TNFAIP6 (tumor necrosis factor, Î±-induced protein 6; pÂ = 0.02) and transforming growth factor-Î² (pÂ = 0.04) after cardiopulmonary bypass in theÂ POAF group. There was a significant decrease in PGC-1Î± (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ coactivator-1Î±; pÂ = 0.002) and CPT1 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; p < 0.0005) in the POAF group after cardiopulmonary bypass.


CONCLUSIONS
Compared with patients without POAF, those with POAF demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction at various levels that are suitable for potential pharmacotherapy.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jelliffe Jeganathan"", ids = ""145326163""); list(name = ""Rabya Saraf"", ids = ""2958350""); list(name = ""Fathima Mahmood"", ids = ""50879397""); list(name = ""Anam Pal"", ids = ""37242748""); list(name = ""Manoj K.

3aff1195f89258da1cfcb2788c49c1d622bd4c4e,"Moving fast, thinking fast: The relations of physical activity levels and bouts to neuroelectric indices of inhibitory control in preadolescents","Background
Structured vigorous physical activity (VPA) can improve cognitive control in children, but studies relating daily physical activity (PA) to cognitive control have yielded conflicting findings. While objectively measured daily PA summarizes all occurrences of PA within a registered period, a minimum duration of continuous PA is required for registration of a PA bout. Because brief bouts of high-intensity PA can account for a large proportion of children's daily activity-related energy expenditure, this study assessed whether daily and bouted VPA were selectively related to cognitive control in preadolescents relative to other PA intensities.


Methods
A total of 75 children between the ages of 8 and 10 years (49% girls) wore an ActiGraph wGT3X+ on the hip for 7 days. The acceleration signal from the vertical axis was summarized over 1 s, 5 s, and 15 s epochs. Daily and bouted moderate PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA, and VPA were measured. PA bouts were expressed as the frequency and time spent in 2 different continuous PA bouts, one lasting â‰¥10 s and the other lasting â‰¥30 s at a given intensity. Inhibitory control was assessed using behavioral responses to a modified flanker task (mean reaction time (RTmean) and accuracy). Attentional resource allocation and cognitive processing speed were measured using the amplitude and latency of the P3 component of event-related brain potentials, respectively. Associations between PA, behavioral indices of inhibitory control, P3 amplitude, and latency were assessed using hierarchical regression models.


Results
Daily VPA was not related to RTmean or accuracy on either congruent or incongruent trials. In contrast, more time spent in VPA bouts lasting â‰¥30 s predicted shorter P3 latency across epochs and flanker congruencies (all Î² â‰¤ -0.24, all p â‰¤ 0.04). The associations between shorter P3 latency and the time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA bouts lasting â‰¥30 s were less consistent and largely limited to congruent trials (congruent: Î² (-0.31, -0.34)). No significant associations were observed upon correction for false discovery rate.


Conclusion
The pattern of uncorrected associations aligns with the dose-response literature and suggests that brief VPA bouts may yield the greatest benefits to cognitive processing speed in preadolescents. Future studies using measures of brain structure and function are needed to understand the mechanisms linking bouted VPA to neurocognitive function during childhood.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dominika Maria Pindus"", ids = ""88188326""); list(name = ""Eric S.

1d2fe7e2fd201d33111ce61898413bae5ced1155,Temporal Filtering to Improve Single Molecule Identification in High Background Samples,"Single molecule localization microscopy is currently revolutionizing the life sciences as it offers, for the first time, insights into the organization of biological samples below the classical diffraction limit of light microscopy. While there have been numerous examples of new biological findings reported in the last decade, the technique could not reach its full potential due to a set of limitations immanent to the samples themselves. Particularly, high background signals impede the proper performance of most single-molecule identification and localization algorithms. One option is to exploit the characteristic blinking of single molecule signals, which differs substantially from the residual brightness fluctuations of the fluorescence background. To pronounce single molecule signals, we used a temporal high-pass filtering in Fourier space on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We evaluated the performance of temporal filtering by assessing statistical parameters such as true positive rate and false discovery rate. For this, ground truth signals were generated by simulations and overlaid onto experimentally derived movies of samples with high background signals. Compared to the nonfiltered case, we found an improvement of the sensitivity by up to a factor 3.5 while no significant change in the localization accuracy was observable.",2018,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexander W.

aa75f5db4440e34d393b6b37fbb8a6d1a82d856e,Clonal diversity of recurrently mutated genes in myelodysplastic syndromes,"Recent studies suggest that most cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are clonally heterogeneous, with a founding clone and multiple subclones. It is not known whether specific gene mutations typically occur in founding clones or subclones. We screened a panel of 94 candidate genes in a cohort of 157 patients with MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). This included 150 cases with samples obtained at MDS diagnosis and 15 cases with samples obtained at sAML transformation (8 were also analyzed at the MDS stage). We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to define the clonal architecture in eight sAML genomes and identified the range of variant allele frequencies (VAFs) for founding clone mutations. At least one mutation or cytogenetic abnormality was detected in 83% of the 150 MDS patients and 17 genes were significantly mutated (false discovery rate â©½0.05). Individual genes and patient samples displayed a wide range of VAFs for recurrently mutated genes, indicating that no single gene is exclusively mutated in the founding clone. The VAFs of recurrently mutated genes did not fully recapitulate the clonal architecture defined by WGS, suggesting that comprehensive sequencing may be required to accurately assess the clonal status of recurrently mutated genes in MDS.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Matthew J.

6515279e6b3a90063a709cf7955ea866747bbf27,A Novel Algorithm for Transcriptome Analysis 1 2,"1 A growing body of evidence implicates the oocyte as a key regulator of ovarian 2 folliculogenesis and early embryonic development. We have screened bovine cDNA microarrays 3 (containing ESTs representing > 15,000 unique genes) with Cy3 and Cy5 labeled cDNA derived 4 from bovine oocyte samples collected at two different stages of meiotic maturation (germinal 5 vesicle versus metaphase II; n = 3 samples per group). Here, we present a novel data analysis 6 approach that uses all available information from above experiments to obtain and index the 7 transcriptome of bovine oocytes and changes in transcriptome composition in response to 8 meiotic maturation. Signal intensities (Fg) for all house-keeping genes were omitted prior to 9 analysis. A local threshold for gene expression was computed as background intensity (Bg) plus 10 2 times the standard deviation of background and foreground signals. Within each array, data 11 were normalized using the LOWESS procedure. Subsequently, a two-stage mixed model was 12 fitted to remove systematic variations. In the first stage, the response was the LOWESS 13 normalized Fg with treatment as a fixed effect. In stage two, the residuals from stage one were 14 analyzed in a gene-specific model that included treatment group and spots nested within patch 15 and array. A test for the difference between Least Squares Means (LSM) for the treatment effect 16 was performed. A False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjustment on the p-values for the difference was 17 carried out. This novel algorithm was compared with approaches that ignore the FDR and the 18 threshold described herein and stark differences obtained. 19 20",2006,,"list(name = ""Peter M Saama"", ids = ""7607258""); list(name = ""Osman V.

54c69539a3a4468aa6edf559b151104aca4ad210,"Partially sequenced organisms, decoy searches and false discovery rates.","Tandem mass spectrometry is commonly used to identify peptides, typically by comparing their product ion spectra with those predicted from a protein sequence database and scoring these matches. The most reported quality metric for a set of peptide identifications is the false discovery rate (FDR), the fraction of expected false identifications in the set. This metric has so far only been used for completely sequenced organisms or known protein mixtures. We have investigated whether FDR estimations are also applicable in the case of partially sequenced organisms, where many high-quality spectra fail to identify the correct peptides because the latter are not present in the searched sequence database. Using real data from human plasma and simulated partial sequence databases derived from two complete human sequence databases with different levels of redundancy, we could demonstrate that the mixture model approach in PeptideProphet is robust for partial databases, particularly if used in combination with decoy sequences. We therefore recommend using this method when estimating the FDR and reporting peptide identifications from incompletely sequenced organisms.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bjorn Victor"", ids = ""3706873""); list(name = ""Sarah GabriÃ«l"", ids = ""5116633""); list(name = ""Kirezi Kanobana"", ids = ""47552687""); list(name = ""Ekaterina Mostovenko"", ids = ""5731741""); list(name = ""Katja Polman"", ids = ""6615304""); list(name = ""Pierre Dorny"", ids = ""4668881""); list(name = ""AndrÃ© M.

179da35c90aa05b13565d2b2a7548565593bab28,Investigation of dietary factors and endometrial cancer risk using a nutrient-wide association study approach in the EPIC and Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and NHSII.,"Data on the role of dietary factors in endometrial cancer development are limited and inconsistent. We applied a ""nutrient-wide association study"" approach to systematically evaluate dietary risk associations for endometrial cancer while controlling for multiple hypothesis tests using the false discovery rate (FDR) and validating the results in an independent cohort. We evaluated endometrial cancer risk associations for dietary intake of 84 foods and nutrients based on dietary questionnaires in three prospective studies, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC; N = 1,303 cases) followed by validation of nine foods/nutrients (FDR â‰¤ 0.10) in the Nurses' Health Studies (NHS/NHSII; N = 1,531 cases). Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI). In multivariate adjusted comparisons of the extreme categories of intake at baseline, coffee was inversely associated with endometrial cancer risk (EPIC, median intake 750 g/day vs. 8.6; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.97, Ptrend = 0.09; NHS/NHSII, median intake 1067 g/day vs. none; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.96, Ptrend = 0.04). Eight other dietary factors that were associated with endometrial cancer risk in the EPIC study (total fat, monounsaturated fat, carbohydrates, phosphorus, butter, yogurt, cheese, and potatoes) were not confirmed in the NHS/NHSII. Our findings suggest that coffee intake may be inversely associated with endometrial cancer risk. Further data are needed to confirm these findings and to examine the mechanisms linking coffee intake to endometrial cancer risk to develop improved prevention strategies.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Melissa A Merritt"", ids = ""31511811""); list(name = ""Ioanna Tzoulaki"", ids = ""145781843""); list(name = ""Shelley S Tworoger"", ids = ""6018067""); list(name = ""Immaculata De Vivo"", ids = ""5629226""); list(name = ""Susan E.

541e82e57296f81ffa855271f847d20417793c73,Bacterial Interactomes: Interacting Protein Partners Share Similar Function and Are Validated in Independent Assays More Frequently Than Previously Reported.,"Numerous affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and yeast two-hybrid screens have each defined thousands of pairwise protein-protein interactions (PPIs), most of which are between functionally unrelated proteins. The accuracy of these networks, however, is under debate. Here, we present an AP-MS survey of the bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris together with a critical reanalysis of nine published bacterial yeast two-hybrid and AP-MS screens. We have identified 459 high confidence PPIs from D. vulgaris and 391 from Escherichia coli Compared with the nine published interactomes, our two networks are smaller, are much less highly connected, and have significantly lower false discovery rates. In addition, our interactomes are much more enriched in protein pairs that are encoded in the same operon, have similar functions, and are reproducibly detected in other physical interaction assays than the pairs reported in prior studies. Our work establishes more stringent benchmarks for the properties of protein interactomes and suggests that bona fide PPIs much more frequently involve protein partners that are annotated with similar functions or that can be validated in independent assays than earlier studies suggested.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Maxim Shatsky"", ids = ""47493734""); list(name = ""Simon Allen"", ids = ""144584141""); list(name = ""Barbara L Gold"", ids = ""31718879""); list(name = ""Nancy L Liu"", ids = ""4628685""); list(name = ""Thomas R.

4b061d9b44d235bcef34f385984a4cf8c0347ba5,Abstract 3980: Quantitative detection of discriminatory proteins in tissue and serum of ovarian cancer patients by LC-MSE,"Purpose To search for potential protein markers or activated pathways which play a role in ovarian cancer. Experimental procedures Serum of six patients with a serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary (stage IIIB or higher) was collected before treatment. Matched control patients with a serous cystadenoma of the ovary were chosen as a control group. In addition, homogeneous regions of cells that exhibited uniform histology were isolated from cancer tissue in three of these patients by laser capture microdissection (LCM), normal ovarian epithelial cell samples were taken from their matched controls. Subsequently we employed label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS E ) to identify proteins and determine their absolute concentrations in serum specimens and tissue lysates. Moderated t-tests were used to identify differentially expressed proteins between patient- and control-group, p-values were adjusted for multiple-testing using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rates. Proteins were considered to be differentially expressed if the adjusted p-values were Summary of the data In the serum specimens, 13 differentially expressed proteins were identified by LC-MS E profiling. Proteins with different concentrations in patients versus control sera include abundant serum proteins such as apolipoprotein AI and transferrin, that both exhibited a lower concentration in serum of cancer patients. Differential expression was also observed for apolipoproteins (APOA IV, APOA II and APOC III) and other proteins that have not been associated with ovarian cancer previously such as C9 and Afamin. In the tissue lysates, 17 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Amounts of collagen found were decreased in cancer tissue. Furthermore, proteins associated with the respiratory chain and cell migration were found in increased amounts in the cancer tissue lysates. Interestingly, no overlap was found between the discriminatory proteins in serum specimens and corresponding tissue lysates, illustrating the challenge to identify a single biomarker in the circulation reflecting ovary cancer. Conclusions Our study revealed several protein changes in serum and the ovary of patients suffering from serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary (stage IIIB or higher). Further investigation of these proteins is warranted to establish whether they could provide new insights into the etiology of the disease and act as potential new disease markers.

d7cff3d7cb8e99390cc53ac43177d8a0494af244,Identification of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Related to the Resistance Against Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease in the Pacific White Shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei by Target Sequencing Approach,"Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) is a major bacterial disease in Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei farming, which is caused by Vibrio parahaemolyticus. AHPND has led to a significant reduction of shrimp output since its outbreak. Selective breeding of disease-resistant broodstock is regarded as a key strategy in solving the disease problem. Understanding the relationship between genetic variance and AHPND resistance is the basis for marker-assisted selection in shrimp. The purpose of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the resistance against AHPND in L. vannamei. In this work, two independent populations were used for V. parahaemolyticus challenge and the resistant or susceptible shrimp were evaluated according to the survival time after Vibrio infection. The above two populations were genotyped separately by a SNP panel designed based on the target sequencing platform using a pooling strategy. The SNP panel contained 508 amplicons from DNA fragments distributed evenly along the genome and some immune-related genes of L. vannamei. By analyzing the allele frequency in the resistant and susceptible groups, 30 SNPs were found to be significantly associated with the resistance of the shrimp against V. parahaemolyticus infection (false discovery rate corrected at P < 0.05). Three SNPs were further validated by individual genotyping in all samples of population 1.

Based on both biological rationale and prior evidence of an impact on Parkinson's disease, we conducted an association study for 106 SNPs in the synaptic vesicle protein 2C (SV2C) gene using genetic and treatment response data from the Clinical Trial of Antipsychotic Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). We examined response to the atypical antipsychotics for Caucasian subjects in the blinded phases, Phases 1A, 1B, and 2, of CATIE with sample sizes as follows: olanzapine (N=134), quetiapine (N=124), risperidone (N=134), and ziprasidone (N=74). Response was defined as change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score using a mixed model repeat measures approach. Subjects homozygous for the T allele of rs11960832 displayed significantly worse response to olanzapine treatment, the only finding with study-wide significance (p=2.94Ã—10(-5); false discovery rate=2.18Ã—10(-2)). These subjects also displayed worse response to quetiapine with nominal significance (p=4.56Ã—10(-2)). While no other SNP achieved study-wide significance, one SNP (rs10214163) influencing Parkinson's disease displayed nominally significant association with olanzapine and quetiapine response, while the second such SNP (rs30196) showed a statistical trend toward correlating with olanzapine and quetiapine response. Furthermore, both coding SNPs examined (rs31244 and rs2270927) displayed nominally significant correlations with treatment response: one for olanzapine (rs227092), and one for quetiapine (rs31244). The fact that multiple SNPs in SV2C may impact response to atypical antipsychotics suggests that further evaluation of SNPs in this gene as PGx predictors of antipsychotic response is warranted.",2013,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Timothy Lynn Ramsey"", ids = ""39002753""); list(name = ""Qian Liu"", ids = ""144324267""); list(name = ""Bill W.

fd15566e90ecfa7fe7f08a0eda597ab50aa22dde,A combined approach with gene-wise normalization improves the analysis of RNA-seq data in human breast cancer subtypes,"Breast cancer (BC) is increasing in incidence and resistance to treatment worldwide. The challenges in limited therapeutic options and poor survival outcomes in BC subtypes persist because of its molecular heterogeneity and resistance to standard endocrine therapy. Recently, high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been used to identify biomarkers of disease progression and signaling pathways that could be amenable to specific therapies according to the BC subtype. However, there is no single generally accepted pipeline for the analysis of RNA-seq data in biomarker discovery due, in part, to the needs of simultaneously satisfying constraints of sensitivity and specificity. We proposed a combined approach using gene-wise normalization, UQ-pgQ2, followed by a Wald test from DESeq2. Our approach improved the analysis based on within-group comparisons in terms of the specificity when applied to publicly available RNA-seq BC datasets. In terms of identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we combined an optimized log2 fold change cutoff with a nominal false discovery rate of 0.05 to further minimize false positives. Using this method in the analysis of two GEO BC datasets, we identified 797 DEGs uniquely expressed in triple negative BC (TNBC) and significantly associated with T cell and immune-related signaling, contributing to the immunotherapeutic efficacy in TNBC patients. In contrast, we identified 1403 DEGs uniquely expressed in estrogen positive and HER2 negative BC (ER+HER2-BC) and significantly associated with eicosanoid, notching and FAK signaling while a common set of genes was associated with cellular growth and proliferation. Thus, our approach to control for false positives identified two distinct gene expression profiles associated with these two subtypes of BC which are distinguishable by their molecular and functional attributes.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaohong Li"", ids = ""50079762""); list(name = ""Eric C.

f7b568939bdbe7953c1a8e9c7560f2f1fa814565,TISA: tissue-specific alternative splicing in human and mouse genes.,"Alternative splicing (AS) is a mechanism by which multiple transcripts are produced from a single gene and is thought to be an important mechanism for tissue-specific expression of transcript isoforms. Here, we report a novel graphing method for transcript reconstruction and statistical prediction of tissue-specific AS. We applied three selection steps to generate the splice graph and predict the transcript isoforms: (i) a custom scoring rule for exon/intron sets, (ii) binomial statistics for selecting valid alternative splicing with a frequency of at least 1% for the predominant form and (iii) evaluation of transcript structure. We obtained 97 286 and 66 022 valid transcripts from 26 143 human and 27 741 mouse genes, respectively. In addition, we discovered 33 481 AS events for nine types of AS patterns in human. The statistical significance of tissue specificity for each gene, transcript and AS event was assessed based on EST tissue information, followed by a multiple testing correction procedure. In human, 12 711 genes, 16 016 transcripts and 1035 AS events were predicted to be tissue-specific (false discovery rate <0.01).

35e2bd3709a682bdae43d166b7a7106c1edcfacb,Candidate gene polymorphisms and risk of psoriasis: A pilot study,"Psoriasis is a complex genetic disease, which has previously been associated with numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are implicated in various processes, including skin barrier functions and in the regulation of inflammatory and immune responses. The present study aimed to investigate the genotypic and allelic frequencies of 32 SNPs at 24 genetic loci, and their association with psoriasis in a Mexican population. These SNPs, which were associated with psoriasis in previous studies, included the following genes: Major histocompatibility complex class I-C (HLA-C), interleukin (IL)-12B, IL-23R, IL-23A, IL-28RA, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, ring finger protein-114 (RNF114), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1, late cornified envelope 3B/3C, signal transducer and activator of transcription 4, LINC01185, interferon induced with helicase C domain 1, IL-13, TNF-Î±-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), TNFAIP3 interacting protein 1, endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1, TNF receptor-associated factor interacting protein 2, Leptin, nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor-alpha, F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 19, nitric oxide synthase 2, cluster of differentiation 40, nuclear receptor coactivator 5, and ADAM metallopeptidase domain 33. A total of 32 male and 14 female subjects with a clinical diagnosis of chronic plaque psoriasis, as well as 103 control subjects, were analyzed. Molecular analyses were performed using TaqManÂ® assays in a TaqManÂ® OpenArrayÂ® Genotyping system. Results were analyzed using the Golden Helix SNP and Variation Suite 7 program. Of the 32 SNPs, six were associated with an increased risk of developing psoriasis, including: HLA-C rs10484554 [allele T: odds ratio (OR) 3.51], IL-12B rs3212227 (allele T: OR 1.88), IL-12B rs3213094 (allele C: OR 1.94), HLA complex group 27 rs1265181 (allele C: OR 2.83), annexin A6 rs17728338 (allele A: OR 2.41), and RNF114 rs6125829 (allele G: OR 1.98). Fisher's exact test detected statistical significance; however, following false discovery rate and Bonferroni correction, this association was no longer significant (threshold for genome-wide significance, P<1.56Ã—10-3). SNPs that were associated with an increased risk of psoriasis in the present study have previously been associated with psoriasis in European, American, and Asian populations. In order to establish genome-wide significance, future studies must analyze a greater sample size. To the best of our knowledge, the present pilot study is the first to investigate the association between these 32 SNPs and psoriasis in a Mexican Mestizo population.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alejandra Villarreal-Martinez"", ids = ""1398099528""); list(name = ""Hugo L Gallardo-Blanco"", ids = ""1399103910""); list(name = ""Ricardo M Cerda-Flores"", ids = ""1399010144""); list(name = ""Iris Torres-MuÃ±oz"", ids = ""1422302794""); list(name = ""Minerva GÃ³mez-Flores"", ids = ""1431741830""); list(name = ""J C Salas-Alanis"", ids = ""1398198082""); list(name = ""Jorge Ocampo-Candiani"", ids = ""1422512411""); list(name = ""Laura Elia MartÃ­nez-Garza"", ids = ""1415939833"")",42945abb52ece4ba9b45515e22c577d85253d16f; 0a7994c02a1a46552fc2028a3e94669822be5cf2; 5b279351add5bdcfd6bf5d951e8b439a7e12850c; 5678f9f567392f606b45570db8d0f89b61c2f8db; 14ed62e10b1976c080e73612c0539c16b3d4e9f7; 8258bf4607563e5db221e448511bbc1a65a33543,88501bd6c08db514b3986e1cf12d676c7ce4193f; b37967fe6ae124d2efb3ffc9bf5b41ab6ee507d2; d8468d6e186a467ee722ca87c4ecd5f500c327c4; 4775dbc2afb76e4060aa5dce16ea1bc58e8f03f8; 294fb90c4b3286e65f4bc7a2409181355b0ef63c; 1714f3d5bc690fea4638ae8fd5275c19e20eb81b; df4645aee8b085c87fced03e50f9326e8731fedd; d7c64465c5272f28cfb25907ff3d6d5608aaaac7; 69959beabe2661194d3e900d863536327aa29735; d8a0dbc4f1168cb358db9dd9dfbd088aa298e7fd; ca09d1eeff1d24e068c116f59eadee0b369d3d57; f3f0a15cb8945f4c80b9a6aeff38132eeb8fc162; 1134a874b8396c0fc7dff8dca1338cf397b920ff; 6eb2267f1ee2d0dc6dd5604f515a45e9abf0d656; fa8062e83eb32e3644236e39198e4e283a2376d8; 8439ffc2a839b5cdd1766ff967a4ab0e64f0e44e; 9ea63f888926cd673b343549b84a47d5268df5b6; 1082866c1926f80f7395c0af01cb19c7f66fcc3c; cc3c97b2abc59ae28ae77f11d47b0a1d681e2ca3; ba0edf3561136e4fb41f7bec9515b1bb8898c956; a2392925f1140df4232b74173d38eb99224638cf,Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine,11,1217 - 1222
a4563e73eaafc4a1e46456599abac370101d225b,Robust and Gaussian spatial functional regression models for analysis of event-related potentials,"ABSTRACT Eventâ€related potentials (ERPs) summarize electrophysiological brain response to specific stimuli. They can be considered as correlated functions of time with both spatial correlation across electrodes and nested correlations within subjects. Commonly used analytical methods for ERPs often focus on preâ€determined extracted components and/or ignore the correlation among electrodes or subjects, which can miss important insights, and tend to be sensitive to outlying subjects, time points or electrodes. Motivated by ERP data in a smoking cessation study, we introduce a Bayesian spatial functional regression framework that models the entire ERPs as spatially correlated functional responses and the stimulus types as covariates. This novel framework relies on mixed models to characterize the effects of stimuli while simultaneously accounting for the multilevel correlation structure. The spatial correlation among the ERP profiles is captured through basisâ€space MatÃ©rn assumptions that allow either separable or nonseparable spatial correlations over time. We induce both adaptive regularization over time and spatial smoothness across electrodes via a correlated normalâ€exponentialâ€gamma (CNEG) prior on the fixed effect coefficient functions. Our proposed framework includes both Gaussian models as well as robust models using heavierâ€tailed distributions to make the regression automatically robust to outliers. We introduce predictive methods to select among Gaussian vs. robust models and models with separable vs. nonâ€separable spatiotemporal correlation structures. Our proposed analysis produces global tests for stimuli effects across entire time (or timeâ€frequency) and electrode domains, plus multiplicityâ€adjusted pointwise inference based on experimentâ€wise error rate or false discovery rate to flag spatiotemporal (or spatioâ€temporalâ€frequency) regions that characterize stimuli differences, and can also produce inference for any prespecified waveform components. Our analysis of the smoking cessation ERP data set reveals numerous effects across different types of visual stimuli.

903b3ce64c791bfaab86fabb2a65fe6543da0e7d,"Transcriptome variance in single oocytes within, and between, genotypes.","The zygote of sexually reproducing organisms contains a combination of parental genomes, and all subsequent cells of the embryo are derived from this original genotype. Although clonal, it is not known how much genetic variation exists in progeny of this original cell, or between cells of the same lineage resulting from this zygote. Oocytes in mammals, especially humans, have prolonged developmental histories and each may be quite different in terms of gene expression. It is clear that oocyte quality can differ significantly within a cohort, and the variation in early developmental success from each oocyte can be dramatic. Oocyte quality is ultimately best measured by success of the embryo, but other features, such as normalcy of the mRNA population, may be important criteria to identify such potential. Here we test the variation in steady-state levels of mRNAs in mouse oocytes to establish a baseline of â€œnormalâ€ variation, and compare it mRNA levels of individual oocytes of poor quality. We sequenced to saturation the mRNA from 5 wildtype oocyte samples (three individual oocytes, and 2 pools of 5 oocytes each from 2 wildtype mice) and 16 Taf4b-deficient oocyte samples (12 individual oocytes and 4 pools of 5 or 10 oocytes each from 2 Taf4b-deficient mice). The Taf4b-deficient mice are known to have oocytes that appear morphologically normal (Figure 1A and B), but are of poor quality with regards to successful embryogenesis. This genotype was selected as a model for human premature ovarian insufficiency (POI; Lovasco et al., 2010). Taf4b-null animals are viable as adults, but the oocytes they make die prematurely in adults, leading to a POI phenotype, and any oocytes that mature and are fertilized do not develop past the 2â€“4-cell stage (Falender et al., 2005; Lovasco et al., 2010).

The hypothesis tested here is that the transcriptome of the Taf4b-deficient oocyte differs significantly from that of the wildtype oocyte. To properly assess this, we also needed to determine the variance between individual oocytes to ascribe significance to the comparison. This data set was generated by high throughput DNA sequencing following transcriptome amplification (Reich et al., 2011) and compared within and between genotypes to determine the variance. To test the fidelity of the amplification process for this protocol, prior to and independent of high-throughput DNA sequencing, oocytes from a wildtype mouse were isolated and pooled before lysing. Following DNase treatment, one oocyte-equivalent was isolated and the cDNA library was synthesized. The resulting library was diluted 100 times, the approximate volume of a single polar body, which is important if a polar body were to be used to determine the oocyte quality without harming the oocyte (Reich et al., 2011). Three samples from this pool were independently amplified, and each technical replicate was tested by qPCR as a measure of the fidelity of the amplification procedure (Reich et al., 2011). Overall, low technical variation was detected, providing confidence in the protocol (Figure 1C). We do not know what kinds of bias the amplification procedure may have, but based on these results, the amplification appears to be consistent. The starting material for a polar body is so limiting, however, that even with this cDNA amplification, qPCR is only able to consistently amplify some transcripts â€“ most rare transcripts have high Ct values, thus the sensitivity of sequencing is therefore preferred. 
 
In order to test the inter- and intra-genotype variation, we collected oocytes from Taf4b-null and wildtype oviducts after ovulation, mechanically and enzymatically stripped of all granulosa cells, and processed the cells for cDNA synthesis and amplification for sequencing as described (Reich et al., 2011). The libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 2000, and the reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm9) using TopHat (Trapnell et al, 2009), yielding an average of 219,207 (std. 138,190) mappable reads per sample. These reads were tested for differential expression using edgeR (Robinson, and Smyth, 2007). A total of 11,373 genes were detected across all 21 samples that were also above a filter threshold of greater than 20 raw counts across all 21 libraries, and a total of 3,242 genes were differentially expressed with a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05 (Supplemental Table 1). A large number of genes are upregulated in the Taf4b mutant samples, including 3,465 genes undetected in the wildtype samples; 1,037 of these genes achieve significance (Supplemental Table 1 and Figure 1D). The gene-by-gene average of the RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) from one genetic background is very similar to the average RPKM from another background (Figure 1D). The log-transformed standard deviations of the RPKMs of wildtype and knockout samples (Supplemental Figure 2) closely mirrors the graph of the means of the RPKMs (Figure 1D), suggesting: a) as genes become more abundant, the variation increases, b) different genomic backgrounds have similar rates of variation, and c) assuming the qPCR results from (Figure 1C) represent the technical variability of all genes, then any bias introduced by the amplification process appears significantly less than the biological variability within a population. 
 
Although the gene-by-gene standard deviation of the RPKM scales linearly with the abundance of the gene, suggesting that samples within a background are similar, we compared how the entire gene set of a sample compared with another sample within the same genetic background and also across backgrounds. The 5 samples isolated from the two wildtype mice (WT1 and WT2) and 16 samples from the two Taf4b mutant mice (KO1 and KO2) clearly segregate by genotype into two main groups; within a group, the samples segregate by mouse to a great degree (Figure 2, and Supplemental Figure 1). Only one of the wildtype samples clustered together with the knockout samples, although the distance between this wildtype sample and all knockout samples (cophenetic distance) is larger than any of the other samples within this group; this indicates that its transcriptional profile is intermediate between the two genotypes.

We conclude that the biological variability of transcriptomes can be quantified between single cells within a genotype, and the comparison between genotypes can reveal genes that are differentially expressed in a robust manner. This approach may help reveal oocyte quality by use of the polar body metric without harm to the oocyte (Reich et al., 2011).",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Adrian Reich"", ids = ""39795058""); list(name = ""Nicola Neretti"", ids = ""1783996""); list(name = ""Richard N Freiman"", ids = ""5990930""); list(name = ""Gary M Wessel"", ids = ""2283624"")",23781b4d31b79daf5197b08a359c2b7fd8c94e01; 8b3dddaeaec9e8c885cccb523d374a7f2db58f7a; 556a0c7a744868cefebfcc647e8fbaf29d842311; fe59916e38a4588dcce887916bbb4f0e112335d8; 12223d00d9c892445ce807f67950357583e97085,9e8dc6fcc2a051beebd1cdf838ba1d1733d09f8b; 7de8b5ce383f19493ec3b1407115970229885b61; 5285aa459bc1415080cc7976cb4d8ee99723adbf; a813e4c10bc4d7dea2a45e5b0dfe37acadfc58d8; e70ba61fab6dfbc4506fc86ed19698cfd9db9384,Molecular reproduction and development,79 8,"

e14ca3cc90468074bd8fe9b409ad6060b52d4d2d,Choice of library size normalization and statistical methods for differential gene expression analysis in balanced two-group comparisons for RNA-seq studies,"High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has evolved as an important analytical tool in molecular biology. Although the utility and importance of this technique have grown, uncertainties regarding the proper analysis of RNA-seq data remain. Of primary concern, there is no consensus regarding which normalization and statistical methods are the most appropriate for analyzing this data. The lack of standardized analytical methods leads to uncertainties in data interpretation and study reproducibility, especially with studies reporting high false discovery rates. In this study, we compared a recently developed normalization method, UQ-pgQ2, with three of the most frequently used alternatives including RLE (relative log estimate), TMM (Trimmed-mean M values) and UQ (upper quartile normalization) in the analysis of RNA-seq data. We evaluated the performance of these methods for gene-level differential expression analysis by considering the factors, including: 1) normalization combined with the choice of a Wald test from DESeq2 and an exact test/QL (Quasi-likelihood) F-Test from edgeR; 2) sample sizes in two balanced two-group comparisons; and 3) sequencing read depths. Using the MAQC RNA-seq datasets with small sample replicates, we found that UQ-pgQ2 normalization combined with an exact test can achieve better performance in term of power and specificity in differential gene expression analysis. However, using an intra-group analysis of false positives from real and simulated data, we found that a Wald test performs better than an exact test when the number of sample replicates is large and that a QL F-test performs the best given sample sizes of 5, 10 and 15 for any normalization. The RLE, TMM and UQ methods performed similarly given a desired sample size. We found the UQ-pgQ2 method combined with an exact test/QL F-test is the best choice in order to control false positives when the sample size is small. When the sample size is large, UQ-pgQ2 with a QL F-test is a better choice for the type I error control in an intra-group analysis. We observed read depths have a minimal impact for differential gene expression analysis based on the simulated data.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaohong Li"", ids = ""50079762""); list(name = ""Nigel G.

The purpose of this paper was to analyze the connectivity of Brodmann's area (BA) 22 in lexico-semantic tasks. MethodsA connectivity fMRI co-activation study was performed by pooling data of lexico-semantic tasks in which BA22 (core of Wernicke's area) was reported. 283 subjects reported in 21 experiments were analyzed. Analysis of Likelihood Estimates of pooled data was utilized to generate the connectivity map; thresholds at p< 0.01 were corrected for multiple comparisons with false discovery rate. Resulting images were co-registered into MNI standard space.Results:network consisting of 13 clusters of activation was obtained. Main clusters were located in the left posterior temporal and left inferior frontal gyrus; in addition to these canonical areas, left insula, pre-supplementary motor area, left BA37, primary auditory areas and left occipital lobe were also involved. Conclusions: BA22-related networks involved in lexico-semantics processing were demonstrated utilizing a pooling-data connectivity study.

b23ca3d6dee5bd45e7557312567e5f5766c7f2b0,Contribution of Heritability and Epigenetic Factors to Skeletal Muscle Mass Variation in United Kingdom Twins,"CONTEXT
Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) is one of the major components of human body composition, with deviations from normal values often leading to sarcopenia.


OBJECTIVE
Our major aim was to conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation study in an attempt to identify potential genomic regions associated with SMM.


DESIGN
This was a mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal study.


SETTING
Community-based study.


PARTICIPANTS
A total of 1550 middle-aged United Kingdom twins (monozygotic [MZ] and dizygotic [DZ]), 297 of which were repeatedly measured participated in the study.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Appendicular lean mass assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry technology, and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing DNA methylation profiling genome-wide were obtained from each individual.


RESULTS
Heritability estimate of SMM, with simultaneous adjustment for covariates obtained using variance decomposition analysis, was h(2) = 0.809 Â± 0.050. After quality control and analysis of longitudinal stability, the DNA methylation data comprised of 723 029 genomic sites, with positive correlations between repeated measurements (Rrepeated = 0.114-0.905). Correlations between MZ and DZ twins were 0.51 and 0.38 at a genome-wide average, respectively, and clearly increased with Rrepeated. Testing for DNA methylation association with SMM in 50 discordant MZ twins revealed 36 081 nominally significant results, of which the top-ranked 134 signals (P < .01 and Rrepeated > 0.40) were subjected to replication in the sample of 1196 individuals. Seven SMM methylation association signals replicated at a false discovery rate less than 0.1, and these were located in or near genes DNAH12, CAND1, CYP4F29P, and ZFP64, which have previously been highlighted in muscle-related studies. Adjusting for age, smoking, and blood cell heterogeneity did not alter significance of these associations.


CONCLUSION
This epigenome-wide study, testing longitudinally stable methylation sites, discovered and replicated a number of associations between DNA methylation at CpG loci and SMM. Four replicated signals were related to genes with potential muscle functions, suggesting that the methylome of whole blood may be informative of SMM variation.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gregory Livshits"", ids = ""145529366""); list(name = ""Fei Gao"", ids = ""145910994""); list(name = ""Ida Malkin"", ids = ""113578809""); list(name = ""Maria Needhamsen"", ids = ""47836445""); list(name = ""Yudong Xia"", ids = ""34512432""); list(name = ""Wei Yuan"", ids = ""153714869""); list(name = ""Christopher G.

1db0b33529b2a852694cfad885cdcaa50fafd7d9,"Error, power, and cluster separation rates of pairwise multiple testing procedures.","In comparing multiple treatments, 2 error rates that have been studied extensively are the familywise and false discovery rates. Different methods are used to control each of these rates. Yet, it is rare to find studies that compare the same methods on both of these rates, and also on the per-family error rate, the expected number of false rejections. Although the per-family error rate and the familywise error rate are similar in most applications when the latter is controlled at a conventional low level (e.g., .05), the 2 measures can diverge considerably with methods that control the false discovery rate at that same level. Furthermore, we shall consider both rejections of true hypotheses (Type I errors) and rejections of false hypotheses where the observed outcomes are in the incorrect direction (Type III errors). We point out that power estimates based on the number of correct rejections do not consider the pattern of those rejections, which is important in interpreting the total outcome. The present study introduces measures of interpretability based on the pattern of separation of treatments into nonoverlapping sets and compares methods on these measures. In general, range-based (configural) methods are more likely to obtain interpretable patterns based on treatment separation than individual p-value-based measures. Recommendations for practice based on these results are given in the article. Although the article is complex, these recommendations can be understood without the necessity for detailed perusal of the supporting material.",2013,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Juliet Popper Shaffer"", ids = ""21801845""); list(name = ""Rhonda K.

b68d4530d48bbd9368a58f4aadfd25def6e101aa,Abstract 2846: SNPs in apoptosis and cell cycle control related genes and brain tumor risk among children in Korea,"Objective In a hospital-based case-control study in Korea, we evaluated the association between polymorphisms in genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle control and brain tumor risk among children. Methods Incident brain tumor cases (n=70) and non-cancer controls (n=254) were recruited from three teaching hospitals in Seoul between May 2003 and August 2006. Information on the characteristics of children and their parents were collected by trained interviewers using structured questionnaire. Tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected using a pairwise linkage-disequilibrium (LD) based algorithm (n=304) were genotyped for 43 cases and 153 controls in this study. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for SNP genotypes were estimated using unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age and birth weight.

However, in expanding populations, spatial demographic processes such as allele surfing can create spatial patterns of neutral genetic variation that appear similar to those generated through adaptive processes. As a result, the false discovery rate of adaptive loci may be inflated in landscape genomic analyses. Here, we take a simulation modelling approach to investigate how range expansion affects our ability to correctly distinguish between neutral and adaptive genetic variation, using the mountain pine beetle outbreak system as a motivating example. We simulated the demographic and population genetic dynamics of populations undergoing range expansion using an individual-based genetic model CDMetaPOP. We investigated how the false discovery rate of adaptive loci is affected by: 1) dispersal capacity; 2) timing of sampling; and 3) the strength of selection on an adaptive reference locus. We found that a combination of weak dispersal, weak selection, and early sampling presents the greatest risk of misidentifying loci under selection. Expanding populations present unique challenges to the reliable identification of adaptive loci. We demonstrate that there is a need for further methodological development to account for directional demographic processes in landscape genomics.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Paul Mayrand"", ids = ""107771559""); list(name = ""Ã‰lise Filotas"", ids = ""88649604""); list(name = ""Julian Wittische"", ids = ""89546155""); list(name = ""Patrick M.

710491a3991ff38c52ec5594dea896beeecac080,Gathering the Gold Dust: Methods for Assessing the Aggregate Impact of Small Effect Genes in Genomic Scans,"Genomewide association scan (GWAS) data mining has found moderate-effect ""gold nugget"" complex trait genes. But for many traits, much of the explanatory variance may be truly polygenic, more like gold dust, whose small marginal effects are undetectable by traditional methods. Yet, their collective effects may be quite important in advancing personalized medicine. We consider a novel approach to sift out the genetic gold dust influencing quantitative (or qualitative) traits. Out of a GWAS, we randomly grab handfuls of SNPs, modeling their effects in a multiple linear (or logistic) regression. The model's significance is used to obtain an iteratively updated pseudo-Bayesian posterior probability associated with each SNP, which is repeated over many random draws until the distribution becomes stable. A stepwise procedure culls the list of SNPs to define the final set. Results from a benchmark simulation of 5 quantitative trait genes among 1,000, in 1,000 random subjects, are contrasted with marginal tests using nominal significance, Bonferroni-corrected significance, false discovery rates, as well as with serial selection methods. Random handfuls produced the best combination of sensitivity (0.95) specificity (0.99) and true positive rate (0.71) of all methods tested and better replicability in an independent subject set. From more extensive simulations, we determine which combinations of signal to noise ratios, SNP typing densities, and sample sizes are tractable with which methods to gather the gold dust.",2008,Computer Science; Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Michael A.

We give the exact law of the sequence of knots conditional on the sequence of variables entering the model, i.e., the post-selection law of the knots of the LAR. Based on this result, we prove an exact of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in the orthogonal design case and an exact control of the existence of false negatives in the general design case. 
First, we build a sequence of testing procedures on the variables entering the model and we give an exact control of the FDR in the orthogonal design case when the noise level can be unknown. Second, we introduce a new exact testing procedure on the existence of false negatives when the noise level can be unknown. This testing procedure can be deployed after any support selection procedure that will produce an estimation of the support (i.e., the indexes of nonzero coefficients) for any designs. The type~$I$ error of the test can be exactly controlled as long as the selection procedure follows some elementary hypotheses, referred to as admissible selection procedures. These support selection procedures are such that the estimation of the support is given by the $k$ first variables entering the model where the random variable $k$ is a stopping time.

We investigated whether circulating immune markers were prospectively associated with MM and its precursor, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Methods: We characterized levels of 43 immune markers in banked sera from 243 MM cases, 506 subjects with MGUS (including those with light-chain disease) who did not progress to MM, and 258 MGUS-free controls using Luminex-based multiplex assay panels. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MM and MGUS were estimated using multivariate-adjusted polytomous logistic regression models. Results: Relative to MGUS-free controls, we observed statistically significant associations with MM risk for six markers using a false discovery rate of 10%, including several chemokines (MCP-2/CCL8, fourth quartile vs first: OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2-3.7; Ptrend=0.017 and SDF-1/CXCL12, 2.6; 1.5-4.4; Ptrend=2.9x10-4), angiogenesis markers (ANG-2, 3.0; 1.7-5.3; Ptrend=1.3x10-4 and HGF, 3.0; 1.7-5.1; Ptrend=2.8x10-5), and growth factors (EGF, 3.2; 1.9-5.5; Ptrend=1.9x10-6 and BMP-9, 2.3; 1.4-4.0; Ptrend=3.3x10-4). Associations with these markers remained after restricting to MM cases diagnosed â‰¥8 years after blood collection although risk estimates were somewhat attenuated (Ptrendâ‰¤0.07). MCP-2/CCL8, SDF-1/CXCL12, and HGF were also significantly elevated among those with MGUS compared with MGUS-free controls (Ptrendâ‰¤0.04). Four markers were associated with progression from MGUS to MM after adjusting for clinical characteristics such as M-protein concentration, serum free light-chain ratio, and immunoglobulin type (ANG-2, fourth quartile vs first: OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.6; HGF, 2.6, 1.4-5.0; EGF, 3.3, 1.8-6.0; and BMP-9, 1.9, 1.0-3.4); dose-response trends were statistically significant for all four markers (Ptrendâ‰¤0.03). Conclusions: This is, to our knowledge, the first prospective study to investigate circulating immunologic markers in relation to MM risk and progression from MGUS to MM. Our findings provide insights into potential biological mechanisms associated with MM development and may have clinical utility for improving risk stratification models assessing the likelihood of progression from MGUS to clinically manifest MM.

891d807fbf7f9aec34f128f9392119aab919d064,Associations of genetically determined iron status across the phenome: A mendelian randomization study,"BACKGROUND
Iron is integral to many physiological processes, and variations in its levels, even within the normal range, can have implications for health. The objective of this study was to explore the broad clinical effects of varying iron status.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data obtained from 48,972 European individuals (55% female) across 19 cohorts in the Genetics of Iron Status Consortium were used to identify 3 genetic variants (rs1800562 and rs1799945 in the hemochromatosis gene [HFE] and rs855791 in the transmembrane protease serine 6 gene [TMPRSS6]) that associate with increased serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation and decreased transferrin levels, thus serving as instruments for systemic iron status. Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of these instruments was performed on 424,439 European individuals (54% female) in the UK Biobank who were aged 40-69 years when recruited from 2006 to 2010, with their genetic data linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) from April, 1995 to March, 2016. Two-sample summary data mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to investigate the effect of varying iron status on outcomes across the human phenome. MR-PheWAS analysis for the 3 iron status genetic instruments was performed separately and then pooled by meta-analysis. Correction was made for testing of multiple correlated phenotypes using a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) threshold. Heterogeneity between MR estimates for different instruments was used to indicate possible bias due to effects of the genetic variants through pathways unrelated to iron status. There were 904 distinct phenotypes included in the MR-PheWAS analyses. After correcting for multiple testing, the 3 genetic instruments for systemic iron status demonstrated consistent evidence of a causal effect of higher iron status on decreasing risk of traits related to anemia (iron deficiency anemia: odds ratio [OR] scaled to a standard deviation [SD] increase in genetically determined serum iron levels 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.81, P = 4 Ã— 10-8) and hypercholesterolemia (hypercholesterolemia: OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.93, P = 2 Ã— 10-5) and increasing risk of traits related to infection of the skin and related structures (cellulitis and abscess of the leg: OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.10-1.42, P = 6 Ã— 10-4). The main limitations of this study relate to possible bias from pleiotropic effects of the considered genetic variants and misclassification of diagnoses in the HES data. Furthermore, this work only investigated participants with European ancestry, and the findings may not be applicable to other ethnic groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings offer novel, to our knowledge, insight into previously unreported effects of iron status, highlighting a potential protective effect of higher iron status on hypercholesterolemia and a detrimental role on risk of skin and skin structure infections.

b589e9a03333df86495b583bc2a5fa34a428037a,Cerebellar heterogeneity and its impact on PET data quantification of 5-HT receptor radioligands,"In the quantification of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer binding, a commonly used method is reference tissue modeling (RTM). RTM necessitates a proper reference and a ubiquitous choice for G-protein coupled receptors is the cerebellum. We investigated regional differences in uptake within the grey matter of the cerebellar hemispheres (CH), the cerebellar white matter (CW), and the cerebellar vermis (CV) for five PET radioligands targeting the serotonin system. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of choosing different reference regions when quantifying neocortical binding. The PET and MR images are part of the Cimbi database: 5-HT1AR ([11C]CUMI-101, nâ€‰=â€‰8), 5-HT1BR ([11C]AZ10419369, nâ€‰=â€‰36), 5-HT2AR ([11C]Cimbi-36, nâ€‰=â€‰29), 5-HT4R ([11C]SB207145, nâ€‰=â€‰59), and 5-HTT ([11C]DASB, nâ€‰=â€‰100). We employed SUIT and FreeSurfer to delineate CV, CW, and CH and quantified mean standardized uptake values (SUV) and nondisplaceable neocortical binding potential (BPND). Statistical difference was assessed with paired nonparametric two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and multiple comparison corrected via false discovery rate. We demonstrate significant radioligand specific regional differences in cerebellar uptake. These differences persist when using different cerebellar regions for RTM, but the influence on the neocortical BPND is small. Nevertheless, our data highlight the importance of validating each radioligand carefully for defining the optimal reference region.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Melanie Ganz"", ids = ""50996871""); list(name = ""Ling Feng"", ids = ""47010030""); list(name = ""Hanne D.

e41a83ea0c39e6a37a13d7a24783e2a8eb88ce68,Towards Unraveling the Human Tooth Transcriptome: The Dentome,"The goal of the study was to characterize the transcriptome profiles of human ameloblasts and odontoblasts, evaluate molecular pathways and advance our knowledge of the human ""dentome"". Laser capture microdissection was used to isolate odontoblasts and ameloblasts from human tooth buds (15-20week gestational age) from 4 fetuses. RNA was examined using Agilent 41k whole genome arrays at 2 different stages of enamel formation, presecretory and secretory. Probe detection was considered against the array negative control to control for background noise. Differential expression was examined using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) 4.0 between different cell types and developmental stages with a false discovery rate of 20%. Pathway analysis was conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. We found that during primary tooth formation, odontoblasts expressed 14,802 genes, presecretory ameloblasts 15,179 genes and secretory ameloblasts 14,526 genes. Genes known to be active during tooth development for each cell type (eg COL1A1, AMELX) were shown to be expressed by our approach. Exploring further into the list of differentially expressed genes between the motile odontoblasts and non-motile presecretory ameloblasts we found several genes of interest that could be involved in cell movement (FN1, LUM, ASTN1). Furthermore, our analysis indicated that the Phospholipase C and ERK5 pathways, that are important for cell movement, were activated in the motile odontoblasts. In addition our pathway analysis identified WNT3A and TGFB1 as important upstream contributors. Recent studies implicate these genes in the development of Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia. The utility of laser capture microdissection can be a valuable tool in the examination of specific tissues or cell populations present in human tooth buds. Advancing our knowledge of the human dentome and related molecular pathways provides new insights into the complex mechanisms regulating odontogenesis and biomineralization. This knowledge could prove useful in future studies of odontogenic related pathologies.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shijia Hu"", ids = ""3724275""); list(name = ""Joel Parker"", ids = ""145406313""); list(name = ""John Timothy Wright"", ids = ""1740327"")",1e9c0de921cf6315bfaaccff86be64231a5404da; 7583c412aab37a0f5588771f4e3112881934c385; 42584ec26f27dfd72b7e07d82e87e8b49a5afff9; 231af85306782dae61b1fe7589db91bee196143e; 277888cb3b2b787b7c07d8ba9a5f152c77237956; 3b8e35c73b1342975088addd703e8bbe7ea31f78; 0831be044f6c8b398410d0339d178ba0a6fb66e4; 94cfd7d2bbed930a638e6837c93354b675b1843f; 035512da736b23c7083ba4712fabd190991c0597,742c81dd18cc651bde2c8e9109ba9f0b3c7178f3; 7cf11d9061e3228e682a7dbc3ee79a8384d7848b; f164db50124956a8edfcd327660c1532adfd5335; 17490dbaa07b5daa1c0e7be07f4e8c84a6a92fc0; e5750c993325e995b2d87f86fb963031f0dbd1f9; f5ee83efe4d3a01b8b3aa6099833e8b20d035a16; 2d0a3d3fe0f0bead2ecacc1e9f6a953caeb147cc; 0b62526addf9a5d04158f0199b70c7570a98ae61; 34489ebb97dc78b37ea02f3de38ae17003a48146; 71aded88c6361ee874f152844435c4f8786894ba; 18891c9cc7cef047c5a9cd60ddafaf7ecf63be77; 5855e5bcc40e38193dfc6106fe5fe6eff85c3dd3; f0d987c49cb2678490cd386efaf3d644a2639091; 8477c629e59fadd902bb194ad373a27a46fe6a80; 33cffa49a07c17a7d832b708f26e5533d85a936f; 925d73a8b28b1e2198f175dcfc219678c151959c; 57e5148dc4e8896bae13b8d0691bcace26f8b21d; 6ddac7e9497bfa1f390d77816586b10f827114e9; 753a218d6a49bf28ce98a60515b3bbfbe4e8dcd4; eb4254c206ba02a9914faf0af161203a3767761d; 8343b64c9afc9ec7cf2f27777afb28c33c4dd361; 2ba43b497643dbcc32c0eeac1a6407401ccbc861; 8e1cbb2173f53373c79fcdd61bc664e45ff3a824; 8d471de6aa0936bd8e62e6a827954b3b726cacf1; 4b71d410cb56318620bcdb35797ffe6d48a35dcf; 3d25f9eb650b9cb47f88eb6d32ec066cc0e32068; c57148b12563a4642d4d5386720eea3852167ea7; 903cff5bb35002cf98c260ade5d1c43473b118ec; d9afe9cf54eaebd0049fdd9fa059e4333466ac27; 1e3686fb6820b3d77dd97ccfd2093e66525e6036; bf01ef7f3d5b673e7fa5570305ebfca41d1986db; 248f40b2a0053edeb8d9ceb8b2aae91f40b99a23; 86b69c4f2b384ff0659ddfe38928f9617fea7fbf; 4f60e6cadcee82bb4aaadba3725bcd2baaca5e3c; 2b98cf3304bdfc8aa88179117709bf41810232a9; ace5aaa6af02f80b2a650f8cdd7ed68e6ebe8adf; 39655ead0ce45ebfd585684259d923f0aa3360a8; 790132d4cfb0fb403913b3bb95e3ecf2f4339fe8; b68e644e681ac6ef38851fb30d8ba3eb46c27ae2; 860a9014f81705ed52f36adf9a3d2b906e0b8aeb; 79397c94bbffa6b98440a099247ac18083b0a6c7; 36ea5e6bb41fed9214e5eb8b8513239fb3a7f00f; ef3dfedd47764cd3125e252515ba728a4a5c827b; a867cd6c4931fe8f01450294564a9f12e89e2ebc,PLoS ONE,10,
81e1dbc7d8723ba1bb444798511417e06df2425b,Accuracy of RNA-Seq and its dependence on sequencing depth,"BackgroundThe cost of DNA sequencing has undergone a dramatical reduction in the past decade. As a result, sequencing technologies have been increasingly applied to genomic research. RNA-Seq is becoming a common technique for surveying gene expression based on DNA sequencing. As it is not clear how increased sequencing capacity has affected measurement accuracy of mRNA, we sought to investigate that relationship.ResultWe empirically evaluate the accuracy of repeated gene expression measurements using RNA-Seq. We identify library preparation steps prior to DNA sequencing as the main source of error in this process. Studying three datasets, we show that the accuracy indeed improves with the sequencing depth. However, the rate of improvement as a function of sequence reads is generally slower than predicted by the binomial distribution. We therefore used the beta-binomial distribution to model the overdispersion. The overdispersion parameters we introduced depend explicitly on the number of reads so that the resulting statistical uncertainty is consistent with the empirical data that measurement accuracy increases with the sequencing depth.

3d0eb1ff65dca89180d0af6c76942c3bbe159be7,A statistical method for the detection of variants from next-generation resequencing of DNA pools,"Motivation: High-throughput sequencing technologies have made population-scale studies of human genetic variation possible. Accurate and comprehensive detection of DNA sequence variants is crucial for the success of these studies. Small insertions and deletions represent the second most frequent class of variation in the human genome after single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Although several alignment tools for the gapped alignment of sequence reads to a reference genome are available, computational methods for discriminating indels from sequencing errors and genotyping indels directly from sequence reads are needed. Results: We describe a probabilistic method for the accurate detection and genotyping of short indels from population-scale sequence data. In this approach, aligned sequence reads from a population of individuals are used to automatically account for context-specific sequencing errors associated with indels. We applied this approach to population sequence datasets from the 1000 Genomes exon pilot project generated using the Roche 454 and Illumina sequencing platforms, and were able to detect a significantly greater number of indels than reported previously. Comparison to indels identified in the 1000 Genomes pilot project demonstrated the sensitivity of our method. The consistency in the number of indels and the fraction of indels whose length is a multiple of 3 across different human populations and two different sequencing platforms indicated that our method has a low false discovery rate. Finally, the method represents a general approach for the detection and genotyping of small-scale DNA sequence variants for population-scale sequencing projects.

5452f4326925689da7e66a437a4a9ab2af60475f,The protease genes CYLD and USP40 are associated with Crohn's disease: results from a European Consortium,"Background: Proteases and protease inhibitors affect several components that contribute to mucosal barrier integrity, and therefore may be important players in the pathophysiology of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Aim: We aimed to elucidate if and which proteases/ protease inhibitors are involved in IBD pathogenesis. Methods: In a first step, a systematic review was performed of all relevant published genetic studies in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), to prioritize all known proteases/protease inhibitors based on the amount of available genetic evidence for association with IBD. In a second step, the topranked genes for CD and UC were followed up in a genetic association study. A total of 185 haplotype tagging SNPs in 23 genes were genotyped in an exploratory cohort of 650 CD (CD1), 721 UC (UC1), and 542 healthy controls (HC1). Replication of SNPs with puncorrected<0.1 was performed in 4 independent cohorts: CD2 (n=634), UC2 (n=528), HC2 (n=900); CD3 (n=377), UC3 (n=290), HC3(n=354); CD4 (n=432), UC4 (n=432); and CD5 (n=227), UC5 (n=141). Cases and controls were compared according to the additive genetic model. False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction was applied to correct for multiple testing (R 2.9.1). Results: All SNPs showing significant associations (pFDR<0.05) in the combined cohort [CD1-5 (n=2320) vs HC1-3 (n=1796), and UC1-5 (n=2112) vs HC1-3] are shown in Table 1. Strongest evidence was found in CD for CYLD, located 9kb downstream of CARD15, with 2 risk increasing and 2 protective SNPs. To test whether the signal seen in CYLD is driven by thewell-established CARD15 association, logistic regressionwas performed. CARD15 data were available in 1135 CD and 674 HC. The final model included both CARD15 and CYLD, pointing to independent signals from both genes (pCYLDrs12324931<0.001, OR=2.1[1.6-2.8]; pCARD15rs2066845<0.001, OR=2.9[1.8-4.8]; pCARD15rs2066847<0.001, OR= 3.7[2.5-5.5]). Patients without CARD15 variants showed significant association with rs12324931 (p=0.005, OR=2.9[1.3-6.6]). Another interesting outcome is the strong signal seen in CD for USP40, located near ATG16L1. Logistic regression analysis in CD1 (versus HC1), showed that rs10929178 and rs12472244 (USP40), and rs2241880 (ATG16L1) are independently associated with risk for CD (p=0.009, OR[0.6-0.9]; p=0.05, OR[0.8-1.0]; and p=0.009, OR[0.6-0.9] respectively). Conclusions: We provide strong evidence for association of CYLD on 16q12.1 in CD patients, which is independent from CARD15. CYLD, a cytoplasmic deubiquitinating enzyme, is a key negative regulator of NF-ÎºB, and has been shown to be significantly down-regulated in the intestine of IBD patients. Moreover, we identified several variants in other protease/protease inhibitor genes which are implicated in either CD (USP40, a ubiquitin-specific peptidase), UC (DAG1, MST1, PSMB8), or both (APEH, USP3).

d2af3c5b1f34a440baa5974e0546bc8201897fda,A weighted FDR procedure under discrete and heterogeneous null distributions.,"Multiple testing (MT) with false discovery rate (FDR) control has been widely conducted in the ""discrete paradigm"" where p-values have discrete and heterogeneous null distributions. However, in this scenario existing FDR procedures often lose some power and may yield unreliable inference, and for this scenario there does not seem to be an FDR procedure that partitions hypotheses into groups, employs data-adaptive weights and is nonasymptotically conservative. We propose a weighted p-value-based FDR procedure, ""weighted FDR (wFDR) procedure"" for short, for MT in the discrete paradigm that efficiently adapts to both heterogeneity and discreteness of p-value distributions. We theoretically justify the nonasymptotic conservativeness of the wFDR procedure under independence, and show via simulation studies that, for MT based on p-values of binomial test or Fisher's exact test, it is more powerful than six other procedures. The wFDR procedure is applied to two examples based on discrete data, a drug safety study, and a differential methylation study, where it makes more discoveries than two existingÂ methods.",2020,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Xiongzhi Chen"", ids = ""121023000""); list(name = ""R.

This paper is motivated by the need to account for challenging constraints that naturally arise in such applications such as channel model uncertainties and demanding sensitivity constraints of the sensing devices. We propose a False Discovery Rate (FDR) based cooperative strategy to sense the occupancy of the spectrum. The proposed strategy is robust to significant uncertainties such as lack of CSI, fading and shadowing effects.

FCAT is a flexible classification framework and toolbox for signal detection in a wide class of high-throughput sequencing applications where the objective is to locate signals in the genome based on their enrichment, shape and other features. FCAT takes aligned sequence reads (BAM files) as input. It uses supervised learning to automatically extract application-specific features that distinguish signals from noises. Users can aggregate multiple learning algorithms including random forests, L1and L2-regularized logistic regression to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. A non-parametric inference method is developed for estimating false discovery rate of prediction results. We demonstrate FCAT through a variety of applications including analyses of DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, GRO-seq and TIP-seq data.

95528b23b088aec038f5984f9911ad4cc17379e4,Medical consequences of pathogenic CNVs in adults: analysis of the UK Biobank.,"BACKGROUND
Genomic CNVs increase the risk for early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders, but their impact on medical outcomes in later life is still poorly understood. The UK Biobank allows us to study the medical consequences of CNVs in middle and old age in half a million well-phenotyped adults.


METHODS
We analysed all Biobank participants for the presence of 54 CNVs associated with genomic disorders or clinical phenotypes, including their reciprocal deletions or duplications. After array quality control and exclusion of first-degree relatives, we compared 381â€‰452 participants of white British or Irish origin who carried no CNVs with carriers of each of the 54 CNVs (ranging from 5 to 2843 persons). We used logistic regression analysis to estimate the risk of developing 58 common medical phenotypes (3132 comparisons).


RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Many of the CNVs have profound effects on medical health and mortality, even in people who have largely escaped early neurodevelopmental outcomes. Forty-six CNV-phenotype associations were significant at a false discovery rate threshold of 0.1, all in the direction of increased risk. Known medical consequences of CNVs were confirmed, but most identified associations are novel. Deletions at 16p11.2 and 16p12.1 had the largest numbers of significantly associated phenotypes (seven each). Diabetes, hypertension, obesity and renal failure were affected by the highest numbers of CNVs. Our work should inform clinicians in planning and managing the medical care of CNV carriers.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Karen L.

Genes that display differential regulation in cancer are a subtype of cancer biomarkers.ResultsWe present an approach to mine expressed sequence tags to discover cancer biomarkers. A false discovery rate analysis suggests that the approach generates less than 22% false discoveries when applied to combined human and mouse whole genome screens. With this approach, we identify the 200 genes most consistently differentially expressed in cancer (called HM200) and proceed to characterize these genes. When used for prediction in a variety of cancer classification tasks (in 24 independent cancer microarray datasets, 59 classifications total), we show that HM200 and the shorter gene list HM100 are very competitive cancer biomarker sets. Indeed, when compared to 13 published cancer marker gene lists, HM200 achieves the best or second best classification performance in 79% of the classifications considered.ConclusionThese results indicate the existence of at least one general cancer marker set whose predictive value spans several tumor types and classification types. Our comparison with other marker gene lists shows that HM200 markers are mostly novel cancer markers. We also identify the previously published Pomeroy-400 list as another general cancer marker set. Strikingly, Pomeroy-400 has 27 genes in common with HM200. Our data suggest that a core set of genes are responsive to the deregulation of pathways involved in tumorigenesis in a variety of tumor types and that these genes could serve as transcriptional cancer markers in applications of clinical interest. Finally, our study suggests new strategies to select and evaluate cancer biomarkers in microarray studies.",2006,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Fabien Campagne"", ids = ""47823776""); list(name = ""Lucy Skrabanek"", ids = ""2703689"")",451c7fe623a3095c8c56bebac4c5e514edb003ba; 3d9b26099e2bd6128242ef8dbeb367bd69534a00; 1b061e4e374163bf33614e4eadcc05bdac7b741a; 521f9668a4fed45c7b9e89a85f19e98548b803d3; 9c64abb1d445361f885c983fdaf33ba8967b9b50; 65c031eb666576d10e97eecb8ccb706a3ecafbdb; 685e734d3a3e35888290158f962052caa85cb7d5; aafc5f0b965bbcab1fab1db6a6c7baa98dbf3f02; 298817dfd32a05b3cd8a1c19c5fa95944fe13ee4; 646f5d5473f3325063c2f070a38f5db0e4a2e86f; e3a6bb8772600ab250f9582d16cbc3193f307d32; 218a3e29fe8ce6131680a8354bfc4b3b3d6194d5; 7286be483aab1e85fb460349f481ba9a2138e7db; 19415720709de5325590c108de67c1d82b10b7d4; 7c564b1985a81655e63ac7cfc1ced2a4789fff3e; ff508a6bc06df4402c38863ceeeffae0d8fadc7c,041e88cd4e8a32d5023c685d36203b1618f7d4b8; 2b588b189dfc022f5bb4f3c4ac7cd28220a84a2c; 7298768f373d97758e0b5f2375a74d48ff3a3a18; f5e07da0265bf3044979f58114fe28faa1bf5a51; 1d9dece252de9457f504c8e79efe50fda73a2199; 0289fe7893f4988a2cbeb01ba666005e7b04df20; bdd7686f978c075e0229bf5f5ade976636cd06ed; ef8161b95ba86b2644b56bfffa54f0926843376a; daade8268177e03cdaa8861a9665d543da68f43a; 5eced352445934615a8428f61887a58be67a0c80; cc9cb3ad0da54f26b3c938613c28ea36b0683834; 4cdda994eb54b7591da9e1b2dcda661502056451; a544671232d5cc450fc2e780b6f2a16af382d48d; c128ed2f7035f3f20c8e7f360097496baa140985; 8e5c7a7ad0ae36db7f00e238574567a72a0e6949; 872162ae237e3c34895495ff24719974b456752c; 1037548f688bd3e566df0d4184509976695124cf; 520fbe130c059fc7e2e8d4c446d9aa34a07610d0; 49409df130f420165422e5ba0798d31e76e9a870; 1f92b9fd56f9b3c3d053aba08700ddece891077a; 9940889401c95a5cd7e25ed4f5df0cf741273502; 1b37279dce5ca9606cbf62a1daf2cbc4dfecc339; 070eb63031af260d840534b33fd8385b7152fda6; 6cd435383c457686d1425adf0412d95169d3d301; 1fff874f8dc60c8e7f1124d3166235716c15df35; 52b7bf3ba59b31f362aa07f957f1543a29a4279e; 75ca252b6c7226f0ff978b3c695f200748fb0536; 0fe5cc324ca9cc96be6f3c54c302f3e120150110; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; f20029d640df5e13c58efffdfc1e418a7a88e92f; 5c5e795736703d9aa7147fedbb1d669ea5c989f0; 081345c658bb9d0398ccaa1832ca54b61108a2e0; 376a9cc7a05a63dfb2737db58b514721fadb0ac1; 20f5782a5fed99979ae406849d7d11bd59314996; 638ec084ada320715e757b375cacd0aa3a27d30f; 08e8680df09c235d559519ae1274e321ebf8dae0; e647363a84b596bfa67456d267e7aa0b41da3d26; 8bcbdc36554258e840230571ab1fa7785ca7e092; 74ec47a29e1f37fc264b3d811587b99d0047df5e; d55a40e168bd25019488993aa21fb6811e907157,BMC Bioinformatics,7,481 - 481

f232a0a82bd4506db7a7e22d1bdff5aaf1a9a9d2,A signal-noise model for significance analysis of ChIP-seq with negative control,"MOTIVATION
ChIP-seq is becoming the main approach to the genome-wide study of protein-DNA interactions and histone modifications. Existing informatics tools perform well to extract strong ChIP-enriched sites. However, two questions remain to be answered: (i) to which extent is a ChIP-seq experiment able to reveal the weak ChIP-enriched sites? (ii) are the weak sites biologically meaningful? To answer these questions, it is necessary to identify the weak ChIP signals from background noise.


RESULTS
We propose a linear signal-noise model, in which a noise rate was introduced to represent the fraction of noise in a ChIP library. We developed an iterative algorithm to estimate the noise rate using a control library, and derived a library-swapping strategy for the false discovery rate estimation. These approaches were integrated in a general-purpose framework, named CCAT (Control-based ChIP-seq Analysis Tool), for the significance analysis of ChIP-seq. Applications to H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 datasets showed that CCAT predicted significantly more ChIP-enriched sites that the previous methods did. With the high sensitivity of CCAT prediction, we revealed distinct chromatin features associated to the strong and weak H3K4me3 sites.

7705712b272f9622a5f7f1677452b45cb5c566b6,Association of genetic variants with chronic kidney disease in Japanese individuals.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Although genetic linkage analyses and association studies have implicated several loci and candidate genes in predisposition to chronic kidney disease (CKD), the genes that underlie genetic susceptibility to this condition have remained uncharacterized. The purpose of the present study was to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to CKD in Japanese individuals.


DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS
The study population comprised 5217 Japanese individuals (2955 men, 2262 women), including 778 subjects (480 men, 298 women) with CKD [estimated GFR (eGFR), <50 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)] and 4439 controls (2475 men, 1964 women; eGFR, > or =60 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)). The genotypes for 40 polymorphisms of 32 candidate genes were determined.


RESULTS
The chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates revealed that the -219G-->T polymorphism of APOE, the -519A-->G of MMP1, the -866G-->A of UCP2, the -1607/1G-->2G of MMP1, the A-->G (Lys45Glu) of MMP3, the G-->A (Ala163Thr) of AGTR1, the G-->A (Gly670Arg) of PECAM1, and the -55C-->T of UCP3 were significantly (false discovery rate <0.05) associated with CKD. Comparison of allele frequencies of these polymorphisms by the chi-square test between subgroups of CKD and control subjects individually matched for covariates revealed that the -519A-->G of MMP1 and the -866G-->A of UCP2 were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with CKD.

9bdb870539bb6cf74e6f2d6137138b1c7a3bc3f4,280 Indistinguishable Transcriptional Profiles between in Vivo- and in Vitro-produced Bovine Fetuses,"During the past several decades, in vitro fertilization (IVF) has been increasingly used in animal production and human infertility treatment. In vitro production (IVP) has been shown to cause reduced developmental competence, aberrant gene expression, and developmental abnormalities. Our objective was to determine how in vitro procedures influence global gene expression during fetal development. To this end, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of liver and placentome tissue samples (n = 18) from IVP and in vivo-derived fetuses at Days 90 and 180 of gestation (n = 5 IVP and n = 4 in vivo-derived pregnancies for each day of gestation). Standard in vitro maturation and fertilization protocols were employed. Putative zygotes were co-cultured with bovine oviductal epithelial cells to the blastocyst stage. In vivo embryos were collected 7 days after AI by nonsurgical uterine flushing. Blastocyst-stage IVP and in vivo embryos were transferred to synchronized recipients and monitored until collection at Day 90 or 180. The pregnancy rate at Day 90 was 12% and 27% for IVP and in vivo pregnancies, respectively (Bertolini et al. 2004 Reproduction 128, 341-354). To conduct expression profiling, total RNA from each tissue sample and a standard reference was indirectly labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively, and hybridized in duplicate to custom, bovine 13 K oligonucleotide microarrays. After Loess normalization, a two-way (origin and day) ANOVA model (GeneSpring 7.3.1) was used to identify differentially expressed genes in each tissue. The P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). The expression of 11 candidate genes was confirmed independently by quantitative RT-PCR. Surprisingly, in both the liver and placentome tissues, no differential gene expression was detected between the IVP and in vivo fetuses at Day 90 and 180. This was observed even when the FDR was relaxed to 10% and 20%. A total of 879 genes (523 genes â‰¥ 1.5-fold) were differentially expressed during liver development from 90 to 180 days of gestation. Conversely, no differential gene expression was detected in the placentomes during this developmental period. Our findings show that during early and mid gestation, surviving IVP fetuses had normal patterns of gene expression. It is possible that embryos with less severe perturbations may survive with their gene expression normalized as development proceeds. Additionally, initial changes in gene expression caused by IVP may affect subsequent development, but do not necessarily persist throughout gestation. Present addresses: L.

This experimental study quantified metabolite levels of Ï‰3-, Ï‰6- and Ï‰9-derived polyunsaturated fatty acids in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) after 4-weeks of repeated house dust mite (HDM) exposure in a murine (C57BL/6) asthma model. The challenge induced airway hyperresponsiveness, pulmonary eosinophil infiltration, but with low and unchanged mast cell numbers. Of the 112 screened LMs, 26 were increased between 2 to >25-fold in BALF with HDM treatment (pâ€¯<â€¯0.05, false discovery rateâ€¯=â€¯5%). While cysteinyl-leukotrienes were the most abundant metabolites at baseline, their levels did not increase after HDM treatment, whereas elevation of PGD2, LTB4 and multiple 12/15-lipoxygenase products, such as 5,15-DiHETE, 15-HEDE and 15-HEPE were observed.

Genome-wide association studies have contributed to the identification of genetic variants associated with coronary artery disease (CAD); a recent genome-wide association studies meta-analysis reported 66 loci significantly associated with CAD.1 However, the heritability explained by these loci remains low, around 15%. One of the limitations of genome-wide association studies is the likelihood of false-negative results related to the strict and commonly defined genome-wide significance threshold that accounts for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction ( P value <5Ã—10âˆ’8). Other methods to correct for the high number of comparisons, such as false discovery rate, provide a larger number of associated loci, but the explained heritability remains around 21%.2

The debate about the role of genetics (nature) versus the role of environmental factors (nurture) on health has classically confronted and opposed these 2 influences, but the interplay between the 2 also contributes to the pathogenesis of complex diseases and could partially explain the missing heritability of CAD. The geneâ€“environment interaction (GÃ—E) adds complexity to the already complex individual roles of genes and environment in the pathogenesis of some diseases, such as CAD. There are several reasons to study GÃ—E interactions: helping to unravel the pathogenic mechanisms of a disease such as in phenylketonuria (ie, 2 necessary causes)3 but also in complex diseases4; from a public health perspective, identifying the subset of individuals in whom a preventive intervention â€¦",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Roberto Elosua"", ids = ""5393829"")",,,Circulation.

5aad68aa29276d9182f38aa73589558b420da094,A Comparative Study of Methods of Analyzing Gene Expression Data,"In analyzing microarray data it is often necessary to detect genes that are differentially expressed between two or more samples. This project aims to apply two methods to address statistical issues that arise when identifying differentially expressed genes. The first is a geneby-gene analysis that attempts to overcome the small sample size issue that is often present in microarray data sets. By averaging the variances of genes with similar expression levels, we are able to stabilize the test statistics used in determining significant genes and obtain more powerful tests. When looking at thousands of tests, one for each gene, problems arise involving the type I error rates. The leads to multiple testing issues that must be addressed. We applied many methods of correcting or adjusting the p-values for multiple testing. Based on this study, the false discovery rate method appears to provide a reasonable balance between the type I error rate and allowing sufficient power to detect differential expression when present. A second approach is to use an overall model for the entire data set. A mixed-effects model is fit to a subset of 100 genes. The estimates of random-effects may be examined to identify differentially expressed genes. An alternative overall model uses a hierarchical Bayesian model to analyze the entire data set using BUGS. This method was also applied to a subset of 100 genes.",2004,,"list(name = ""Joseph DeCampo"", ids = ""78323922""); list(name = ""Kristin Harp"", ids = list()); list(name = ""Christopher H.

e39399f25d8e24b5bcfa7dafe574a4465ec1994e,Systematic Comparison of False-Discovery-Rate-Controlling Strategies for Proteogenomic Search Using Spike-in Experiments.,"Proteogenomic searches are useful for novel peptide identification from tandem mass spectra. Usually, separate and multistage approaches are adopted to accurately control the false discovery rate (FDR) for proteogenomic search. Their performance on novel peptide identification has not been thoroughly evaluated, however, mainly due to the difficulty in confirming the existence of identified novel peptides. We simulated a proteogenomic search using a controlled, spike-in proteomic data set. After confirming that the results of the simulated proteogenomic search were similar to those of a real proteogenomic search using a human cell line data set, we evaluated the performance of six FDR control methods-global, separate, and multistage FDR estimation, respectively, coupled to a target-decoy search and a mixture model-based method-on novel peptide identification. The multistage approach showed the highest accuracy for FDR estimation. However, global and separate FDR estimation with the mixture model-based method showed higher sensitivities than others at the same true FDR. Furthermore, the mixture model-based method performed equally well when applied without or with a reduced set of decoy sequences. Considering different prior probabilities for novel and known protein identification, we recommend using mixture model-based methods with separate FDR estimation for sensitive and reliable identification of novel peptides from proteogenomic searches.",2017,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Honglan Li"", ids = ""46382192""); list(name = ""Jonghun Park"", ids = ""152993562""); list(name = ""Hyunwoo Kim"", ids = ""38297125""); list(name = ""Kyu-Baek Hwang"", ids = ""3067161""); list(name = ""Eunok Paek"", ids = ""2301357"")",6726c162b4f4584114ad508ebfb14a3726ff2837,,Journal of proteome research,16 6,"

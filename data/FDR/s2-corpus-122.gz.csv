1c4e776b23c62e4a03011d07fcdf12ec1b0b9dc1,Genome-wide association mapping of milk production traits in Braunvieh cattle.,"A whole-genome association study of milk production traits: milk yield, protein yield, fat yield, protein percentage, and fat percentage, was performed on the population of Braunvieh cattle. Five hundred and fifty-four progeny-tested bulls and 36,219 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers on 29 Bos taurus autosomes (BTA) were included in the analysis. A principal component analysis was conducted to adjust for the effect of population stratification in the analyzed data set. For the principal component analysis, genome-wide relationships between individuals were calculated. Three different criteria (Horn's test, Kaiser's criterion, and Jolliffe's criterion) were tested to determine the number of significant principal components. Estimation of putative associations between SNP and milk production traits was carried out using a linear regression model in R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Significant principal components, adjusting for population stratification separately for each criterion and family relationships and genotypes at individual SNP were included as fixed effects in the model. The inflation factor Î» and quantile-quantile plots were calculated to compare how the different criteria deal with stratification in our mapping population. Based on the analyses on all of the aforementioned criteria, we can conclude that Jolliffe's criterion deals the best with population stratification. Furthermore, significance thresholds for a given genome-wide false discovery rate of 5% were estimated and used for specific traits. Three of the analyzed traits showed genome-wide significant association with SNP. Two SNP had an effect on milk yield on BTA4, 2 SNP affected fat yield on BTA14 and BTA23, and 1 SNP was associated with fat percent on BTA1. Single nucleotide polymorphisms identified in this study as associated with milk production traits will further contribute to the mapping of corresponding quantitative trait loci and investigation of the genes responsible for polymorphisms in milk production traits in dairy cattle. Described comparison of different criteria for determination of significant principal components can provide important information for similar studies in stratified populations.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jaroslav Maxa"", ids = ""13947798""); list(name = ""Markus Neuditschko"", ids = ""2783155""); list(name = ""Ingolf Russ"", ids = ""6371796""); list(name = ""Martin Foerster"", ids = ""50627402""); list(name = ""Ivica Medugorac"", ids = ""2724221"")",1e4291546460a9dd60ba087300a105cce3a83b1d; 394c721ade04899d24ea26c8909b5431f54cd80f; 04e7d1af767b77903b4e67ded61b4a7aa61aa56d; dad9ece1e2580e98b83095a063a6b8ae1a755d35; b789c7467490b05ab57ead2c0de1bf17f7b258f7; 9918cec6fb8ea923cb193480d8633365faa16b1a; 12fac8057e0ba1f6a51b5a3e3b96f05ab62fdb5f; 00231251fb5f5d59ae1a956148631eadac70b3a7; 8defd31b7a5832596e5ae8fa4c918cf3a1efe63d; 3607992afe0a8f2b0d0c157d176730a59dfe696b; 1b102299cb1ed881ef2c48a1f25b6ad06062f451; 5b08d6e8ad50c76d2ede15454c460befa229c3cc; b728c55d6c8e8b7eb838c9f87b4420d525f1b507; 7602a8933d2645b772d52377880d44f84fe45200; 5b33047f135c83ff184858249444d2bc78473aba; c71383113210e74f37d7328e76a05dcb04fe680c,3c52a169257abf3372d50b5072a4f15506ba07d5; cd3feaa37dcdd768cc68ec261471a40e18fa3a4c; e205a9cf860a45b34941cc0c0e0ac953134606a8; 198a1a291115a70c2241174cbcec38465efbe740; 75c9760037cbe5254d2e619f5fcd552d0e3694b4; 54843e04cbab6df1bf1203a29475a22d251468e6; 98b528e539c936911249d4d364aedc0e6236bec6; f7bb8b20c217c81cb446b0bd9c3f6b187de80b6c; 932e12077667f8cede6fad89369038ad162d98ef; 9ea69fd62ec005e8aa109ec83a6b1116301c4d51; 0b79167dd30c985cfbc065ab6ecde221aab3987a; f37f8cf2e68c44caffba1e43f48f8df02ccdfc74; 76663bb40c27687e79ff4da47292271a13d997bd; 5178bef97566263124c1a4810fad2eedb991cf05; 59185c7da895fe6b2195ab5482037da805b8625d; 18d3a9d82f0a48e88d44600c364e926ff15225ef; 7cd5382ff13830b6c263e15eb301f3ebcd9d203a; 91c99b3ee7effe171f52636b011e448d78b8018e; 6126379e9ffbf088fc5cf838ba53a9b95526d0d5; 6785bb32b6da76cc68d86fda1df8b0c251e13d7c; 5d00a4cea707b7ed6b1e6bde493b60b3c98a0b21; 7ec7e24dd4025819ae386a9ae016465f8d5076d1; 468b266b730d70642c62277ad0c4780cb2e85c30; c850813fe8d6249806ead14f7fcad21e7932f21d; 9caa4da3e39668ae9b3d3726890ba41299072259; 1efc86d78b94931fefdfd47614299f6c6c17980e; 041f84a120adb88b76405e5840f621d70497e865; 4b57f4f7516dd8003f179575257cd056f7dd3fd6; fbbdc2e73d4d49f42686b414473a9c876a33d875; 792b46c1aabfea00968033f8976cdba0b22367fa; 8e24be3916aff757fdac3fb390d6572f58d85296; 5e116533ae43a4ee839e1a40bb3f4dec1ead5511; b9ea56b03a7190ce015db7fb362d6d0f6ea09aee; 6ae3450e6c10d94298bfb1f5a61125f997bf4c26; 44c406f43660c6d96ef65365ddecab3b8ef982ad,Journal of dairy science,95 9,"

c256e10c620ae822ab4ca2cb9360d485d3eef3e5,RNA-seq analysis revealed novel genes and signaling pathway associated with disease resistance to avian influenza virus infection in chickens.,"Avian influenza virus (AIV) is a type A virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Avian influenza virus infection can cause significant economic losses to the poultry industry, and raises a great public health threat due to potential host jump from animals to humans. To develop more effective intervention strategies to prevent and control AIV infection in poultry, it is essential to elucidate molecular mechanisms of host response to AIV infection in chickens. The objective of this study was to identify genes and signal pathways associated with resistance to AIV infection in 2 genetically distinct highly inbred chicken lines (Fayoumi, relatively resistant to AIV infection, and Leghorn, susceptible to AIV infection). Three-week-old chickens were inoculated with 10(7) EID50 of low pathogenic H5N3 AIV, and lungs and trachea were harvested 4 d postinoculation. Four cDNA libraries (1 library each for infected and noninfected Leghorn, and infected and noninfected Fayoumi) were prepared from the lung samples and sequenced by Illumina Genome Analyzer II, which yielded a total of 116 million, 75-bp single-end reads. Gene expression levels of all annotated chicken genes were analyzed using CLC Genomics Workbench. DESeq was used to identify differentially expressed transcripts between infected and noninfected birds and between genetic lines (false discovery rate < 0.05 and fold-change > 2). Of the expressed transcripts in a total of 17,108 annotated chicken genes in Ensembl database, 82.44 and 81.40% were identified in Leghorn and Fayoumi birds, respectively. The bioinformatics analysis suggests that the hemoglobin family genes, the functional involvements for oxygen transportation and circulation, and cell adhesion molecule signaling pathway play significant roles in disease resistance to AIV infection in chickens. Further investigation of the roles of these candidate genes and signaling pathways in the regulation of host-AIV interaction can lead new directions for the development of antiviral drugs or vaccines in poultry.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ying I Wang"", ids = ""30028916""); list(name = ""Blanca Lupiani"", ids = ""4446313""); list(name = ""S.

7f8e259a67c775fb2f4ec041622ce3f88fd0be51,P.1.029 Multimodal neuroimaging with PET and MRI to investigate the relation between serotonergic neurotransmission and regional brain volumes,"Purpose of the study: Altered neuroplasticity is consistently reported to be involved in the neuropathophysiology of major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Morphometric methods using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and voxelbased morphometry (VBM) demonstrated losses of gray matter volume, whereby the hippocampus and other brain areas of the limbic system proved to be especially vulnerable [1]. Furthermore, growing evidence shows distinctive neuromodulatory properties of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in developing and mature brain networks [2]. The major inhibitory serotonergic (5-HT1A) receptor directly mediates neuroplasticity and was also demonstrated to be quantitatively altered in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with depression, schizophrenia and Alzheimerâ€™s disease [3]. In this study we examined the neuroplastic properties of 5-HT1A receptors in vivo using structural MRI and PET in healthy subjects. Methods: PET using the 5-HT1A-receptor-specific radioligand [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 and structural high-field MRI were performed in 35 healthy subjects (mean 26.6Â±6.8 years; 17 women) to quantify voxel-wise 5-HT1A receptor binding (5-HT1A BPND), associated with 5-HT1A receptor density, and gray matter volume (GMV), respectively. To demonstrate associations between 5-HT1A receptor BPND and GMV multiple linear regression was calculated with GMV as dependent and 5-HT1A BPND as independent variable. Additionally, to evaluate a potential regulatory influence of the major serotonergic nucleus, the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), we calculated regression analysis between whole brain GMV as dependent variable and 5-HT1A BPND of the DRN as independent variable. Control variables in both analyses were age, sex and total GMV. Finally, an independent ROI-approach using an anatomical atlas was used to confirm the results. Results: 5-HT1A receptor binding was highly significantly associated with GMV in the hippocampus, medial temporal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, medial occipital cortex and the pericalcarine region in each hemisphere (R2: 0.308â€“0.503, p< 0.05 false discovery rate corrected). ROI-based analysis further suggested significant positive associations in the hippocampus, but not in the insula, a selected control region with similar GMV values and a similar GMV/receptor BPND ratio as the hippocampus. This suggests that these associations do not dependent on the absolute value of local gray matter volumes. Finally, 5-HT1A receptor levels in the DRNwere associated with GMV of the anterior cingulate cortex (R2 = 0.656, p = 0.001, uncorrected). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that 5-HT1Areceptor-mediated neuroplasticity is detectable in vivo in healthy human subjects. These associations occur regionally in distinctive areas, symmetrically in the brain, but they were not associated with locally higher values of GMV. Moreover the DRN, previously known to regulate tonic serotonergic firing as well as 5-HT1A receptor densities throughout the brain, was discovered to regulate GMV of the medial forebrain. These results show that a combination of structural and molecular neuroimaging might be able to reveal dysfunctional neuroregulatory processes, which could lead to gray matter atrophy in clinical populations. This approach could provide a better understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease, schizophrenia and mood disorders and ultimately a better diagnostic assessment and therapeutic evaluation of patients with these highly life impairing disorders.",2012,Psychology,"list(name = ""Carolyn Kraus"", ids = ""33758852""); list(name = ""Markus Savli"", ids = ""3019327""); list(name = ""Andreas Hahn"", ids = ""32653778""); list(name = ""Anna S.

063e7a415bd7d090630e9c338a5f6394cceff518,Super-resolution track density imaging of glioblastoma: histopathologic correlation.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Super-resolution track density imaging generates anatomic images with submillimeter voxel resolution by using high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging and fiber-tractography. TDI within the diseased human brain has not been previously described. The purpose of this study was to correlate TDI with histopathologic features of GBM.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 43 tumor specimens (24 contrast-enhancing, 12 NE, and 7 centrally necrotic regions) were collected from 18 patients with treatment-naÃ¯ve GBM by use of MR imaging-guided neurosurgical techniques. Immunohistochemical stains were used to evaluate the following histopathologic features: hypoxia, architectural disruption, microvascular hyperplasia, and cellular proliferation. We reconstructed track density maps at a 0.25-mm isotropic spatial resolution by using probabilistic streamline tractography combined with constrained spheric deconvolution (model order, 8; 0.1-mm step size; 1 million seed points). Track density values were obtained from each tissue site. A P value of .05 was considered significant and was adjusted for multiple comparisons by use of the false discovery rate method.


RESULTS
Track density was not significantly different between contrast-enhancing and NE regions but was more likely to be elevated within regions demonstrating aggressive histopathologic features (P < .05). Significant correlation between relative track density and hypoxia (odds ratio, 3.52; P = .01), architectural disruption (odds ratio, 3.49; P = .03), and cellular proliferation (odds ratio, 1.70; P = .05) was observed irrespective of the presence or absence of contrast enhancement.


CONCLUSIONS
Numeric values of track density correlate with GBM biologic features and may be clinically useful for identification of regions of tumor infiltration within both enhancing and NE components of GBM.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ramon Francisco Barajas"", ids = ""4679893""); list(name = ""Christopher P.

8b04765acf4c474869ae69be0fb5752a5817330e,"Tools (Viewer, Library and Validator) that Facilitate Use of the Peptide and Protein Identification Standard Format, Termed mzIdentML*","The Proteomics Standards Initiative has recently released the mzIdentML data standard for representing peptide and protein identification results, for example, created by a search engine. When a new standard format is produced, it is important that software tools are available that make it straightforward for laboratory scientists to use it routinely and for bioinformaticians to embed support in their own tools. Here we report the release of several open-source Java-based software packages based on mzIdentML: ProteoIDViewer, mzidLibrary, and mzidValidator. The ProteoIDViewer is a desktop application allowing users to visualize mzIdentML-formatted results originating from any appropriate identification software; it supports visualization of all the features of the mzIdentML format. The mzidLibrary is a software library containing routines for importing data from external search engines, post-processing identification data (such as false discovery rate calculations), combining results from multiple search engines, performing protein inference, setting identification thresholds, and exporting results from mzIdentML to plain text files.

64483a0bfca60539672db04e77c80a69e8a0b15d,Genome-Wide Analysis of DNA Methylation and Acute Coronary Syndrome,"Rationale: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Immune functions play a vital role in ACS development; however, whether epigenetic modulation contributes to the regulation of blood immune cells in this disease has not been investigated. Objective: We conducted an epigenome-wide analysis with circulating immune cells to identify differentially methylated genes in ACS. Methods and Results: We examined genome-wide methylation of whole blood in 102 ACS patients and 101 controls using HumanMethylation450 array, and externally replicated significant discoveries in 100 patients and 102 controls. For the replicated loci, we further analyzed their association with ACS in 6 purified leukocyte subsets, their correlation with the expressions of annotated genes, and their association with cardiovascular traits/risk factors. We found novel and reproducible association of ACS with blood methylation at 47 cytosine-phosphoguanine sites (discovery: false discovery rate <0.005; replication: Bonferroni corrected P<0.05). The association of methylation levels at these cytosine-phosphoguanine sites with ACS was further validated in at least 1 of the 6 leukocyte subsets, with predominant contributions from CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and B cells. Blood methylation of 26 replicated cytosine-phosphoguanine sites showed significant correlation with expressions of annotated genes (including IL6R, FASLG, and CCL18; P<5.9Ã—10âˆ’4), and differential gene expression in case versus controls corroborated the observed differential methylation. The replicated loci suggested a role in ACS-relevant functions including chemotaxis, coronary thrombosis, and T-cellâ€“mediated cytotoxicity. Functional analysis using the top ACS-associated methylation loci in purified T and B cells revealed vital pathways related to atherogenic signaling and adaptive immune response. Furthermore, we observed a significant enrichment of the replicated cytosine-phosphoguanine sites associated with smoking and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Penrichmentâ©½1Ã—10âˆ’5). Conclusions: Our study identified novel blood methylation alterations associated with ACS and provided potential clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our results may suggest that immune signaling and cellular functions might be regulated at an epigenetic level in ACS.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jun Z.

3577e8651cc0ac78d0f11df785213de2458579ae,Cancer-related long noncoding RNAs show aberrant expression profiles and competing endogenous RNA potential in esophageal adenocarcinoma,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) govern gene expression by competitively binding to microRNA response elements (MREs). Although they were initially considered as transcriptional noise, lncRNAs have attracted increased attention in oncology. Dysregulation of lncRNAs occurs in various types of human tumor, including esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). However, the functions of these cancer-associated lncRNAs and of their related competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network in EAC remains unknown. To determine the relevant potential mechanisms, the present study analyzed the transcriptome sequencing data and clinical information of 79 patients with EAC, including 79 tumor samples and 11 normal samples, which were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas esophageal cancer project. The edgeR v3.25.0 software was used for differential gene expression analysis. The results exhibited 561 cancer-associated lncRNAs with a >2.0-fold change and a false discovery rate-adjusted P<0.01. Among these lncRNAs, 26 were significantly associated with patient overall survival. According to data from bioinformatics databases and differentially expressed RNAs, an lncRNA-regulated ceRNA network for EAC was constructed. The results demonstrated that the aberrantly expressed lncRNA-associated ceRNA network included 37 EAC cancer-associated lncRNAs, five miRNAs and 13 mRNAs. In conclusion, the present study identified novel lncRNAs as candidate prognostic biomarkers and revealed a potential regulatory network of gene expression in EAC.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yang Yu"", ids = ""144837155""); list(name = ""Xingxing Chen"", ids = ""48282755""); list(name = ""Shun-dong Cang"", ids = ""40408117"")",,ff47b6050fdc34c8d9e7657189785d4b782e96a3; 7cca189ad7e9dbc67f7eca68c026069bb6f0fcaa; 2e9b4661fd04f5b56a877a1df6b8997fe4fc5cb8; b1fcee7e7cbfe8219cd67ce54ec6e31c6bc73c49; 85ada8a3fd7dd4ae08cd1818ff7d54355944d02b; a06e4efd4b0368ae9a48ea0af545f2083eea8fef; 0c13852b5360c8fbf141d45ba0f5c8694369b29f; 43fe83678742bf8af13a3f7e28a8ec0d12658fa1; 5b5f561897b086a6ac929f4f9085db0257127bed; 4d88ba121d9993aedfcb7235e21606603c1fb21d; 044403b720efb6f8f73d6b0d37e48450005f2d42; 9b6695c64e03af831402171ad5f263cb2987e522; f1ae41b6c0dec8080f2c35b4c3b290d60aa680e4; 0f2df958e84aca9bf4130af17db5eec344424d84; 838bba5ab0a63420a9a3713849cc611f017f053c; 37b4e7be546b2a7075b4ff5dc1626b2f2e06d54e; 886f25336b5e8c4b711d28923e4f7d63c75d23ae; 5a8c2a83a8634ef46a834bfdfc2ec1ea19f88f2b; a1f85499656e39cc90b000475e16fa496dfafe47; b05820972b71cfb23cc74624a94116716b5e72d3; 02e70a69005abf21219271f460161ea4d1650dd9; 60bd12e2078ed5821b5336b70d3b7d11b0383f9b; eb831ad42c4a4b31ce82bc8bd912a1a67f7b95cb; 8f3d5ebfeaf185aec9b8eddafb6c9c758afccf96; 9c824b4c40414d2ecbabb5d0451eb7a4140e596b; 3eb0b4a77094cf3629eff803174c8451ea6bd61f; 78444d4f7b168cd9ba6ebd8ca0169cb656152893; 99f8f45541ca04aebdc6c1b26d33a26e5027d25e; 50317734da93fbf460142450d73e698a5b376221; 33452aa2b1e91e489f8aaad55984422eefc2dbac; 4bba1a483f5cb416a25197705038d236c3e84edf; 3b50e99f395770a06a9ba0c73a8b3fcb3b8c9f5a; acb729677de704efe4f639819eb02a5f3be32fd4; f633767df629ef5aa845682c93027fa8db4c31bc; 96d6dfc1ee549261f0c1696f110387e0aacf056a; 00aef89ba22649ff9aa8ed9d1774553d2a2fb867; 2813a7c5912bf79324e1387f0dfea848de0ef332; 331b4dc9d86c53de34c35550a64b2f44f55147bb; ecaea2e09373e768b4873664c26bbec0929c2a12; 415387a40c571e2521c9eb7a58ada1ab888c4f56; 5133a41f134718846614dcd9bd864321381c496d; 262a6586952697bc3421ca14318317ea4590eca6; 50dfd25fccf9891ec5fbf1a3c62bbd129bafe033; 34b495c7057ef1cc605ec5e8019e4433c2aefed7; e2d549a8ba420e3ffcbba0ad0fa154669209de22; 34d03a69a6b004bba1bc299f1a5755c02a2335ed; eb59bc95d3d45da27865e66a7e9d84e42816dd6f,Oncology Letters,18,4798 - 4808
a99eade401bcbda62707d2fff0b52d69ff45f532,Protein identification false discovery rates for very large proteomics data sets generated by tandem mass spectrometry.,"Comprehensive characterization of a proteome is a fundamental goal in proteomics. To achieve saturation coverage of a proteome or specific subproteome via tandem mass spectrometric identification of tryptic protein sample digests, proteomics data sets are growing dramatically in size and heterogeneity. The trend toward very large integrated data sets poses so far unsolved challenges to control the uncertainty of protein identifications going beyond well established confidence measures for peptide-spectrum matches. We present MAYU, a novel strategy that reliably estimates false discovery rates for protein identifications in large scale data sets. We validated and applied MAYU using various large proteomics data sets. The data show that the size of the data set has an important and previously underestimated impact on the reliability of protein identifications. We particularly found that protein false discovery rates are significantly elevated compared with those of peptide-spectrum matches. The function provided by MAYU is critical to control the quality of proteome data repositories and thereby to enhance any study relying on these data sources. The MAYU software is available as standalone software and also integrated into the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lukas Reiter"", ids = ""1969450""); list(name = ""Manfred Claassen"", ids = ""3522545""); list(name = ""Sabine P.

f214cc200b16db2433a2788607175a61e1af89ac,An alanine expanded PABPN1 causes increased utilization of intronic polyadenylation sites,"In eukaryote genomes, the polyadenylation site marks termination of mature RNA transcripts by a poly-adenine tail. The polyadenylation site is recognized by a dynamic protein complex, among which the poly-adenine-binding protein nuclear1 plays a key role. Reduced poly-adenine-binding protein nuclear1 levels are found in aged muscles and are even lower in oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy patients. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy is a rare, late onset autosomal dominant myopathy, and is caused by an alanine expansion mutation in poly-adenine-binding protein nuclear1. Mutant poly-adenine-binding protein nuclear1 forms insoluble nuclear aggregates leading to depletion of functional poly-adenine-binding protein nuclear1 levels. In oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy models, increased utilization of proximal polyadenylation sites has been observed in tandem 3â€²-untranslated regions, and most often cause gene upregulation. However, global alterations in expression profiles canonly partly be explained by polyadenylation site switches within the most distal 3â€²-untranslated region. Most poly-adenine signals are found at the distal 3â€²-untranslated region, but a significant part is also found in internal gene regions, like introns, exons, and internal 3â€²-untranslated regions. Here, we investigated poly-adenine-binding protein nuclear1â€™s role in polyadenylation site utilization in internal gene regions. In the quadriceps muscle of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy mice expressing expPABPN1 we found significant polyadenylation site switches between gene regions in 17% of genes with polyadenylation site in multiple regions (Nâ€‰=â€‰574; 5% False Discovery Rate). Polyadenylation site switches between gene regions were associated with differences in transcript expression levels and alterations in open reading frames. Transcripts ending at internal polyadenylation site were confirmed in tibialis anterior muscles from the same mice and in mouse muscle cell cultures overexpressing expPABPN1. The polyadenylation site switches were associated with nuclear accumulation of full-length transcripts. Our results provide further insights into the diverse roles of poly-adenine-binding protein nuclear1 in the post-transcriptional control of muscle gene expression and its relevance for oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy pathology and muscle aging.Muscle degeneration: RNA structures as modulator of muscle functionTranscriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression has a fundamental role in shaping the protein landscape. In skeletal muscles, the RNA landscape plays an important role in muscle function in both health and disease conditions. PABPN1 is a key regulator of mRNA processing in a late-onset muscular dystrophy and in aging. Here, the authors demonstrate that a decrease in PABPN1 function results in genome-wide alterations in mRNA structures. Reduced PABPN1 function alters both mRNA levels and RNA structures leading to altered protein sequences. Importantly, among the affected genes are muscle function regulators. Together, this study calls for a better understanding of alterations in RNA structures in disease and aging.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tooba Abbassi-Daloii"", ids = ""1405434920""); list(name = ""Soheil Yousefi"", ids = ""50263238""); list(name = ""Eleonora de Klerk"", ids = ""49580733""); list(name = ""Laurens Grossouw"", ids = ""18189788""); list(name = ""Muhammad Riaz"", ids = ""48044384""); list(name = ""Peter A.

Water infusion at a flow-rate of 0.4 mL/h yielded not only an average 16.6-fold increase in intensity of the quasimolecular ion for 20 MCF-derivatized metabolite standards through suppression of in-source fragmentation but also the most repeatable peak area integrals. The impact of water infusion was the greatest for dicarboxylic acids and the least for (hetero-) aromatic compounds. Water infusion also improved the ability to detect reliably fold changes as small as 1.33-fold for the same 20 MCF-derivatized metabolite standards spiked into a human serum extract. On the other hand, MO-TMS derivatives were not significantly affected by water infusion, neither in their fragmentation patterns nor with regard to the detection of differentially regulated compounds. As a proof of principle, we applied MCF derivatization and GC-APCI-TOFMS to the detection of changes in abundance of metabolites in pancreatic cancer cells upon treatment with 17-DMAG. Water infusion increased not only the number of metabolites identified via their quasimolecular ion but also the reproducibility of peak areas, thereby almost doubling the number of significantly regulated metabolites (false discovery rate < 0.05) to a total of 23.",2014,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christian J.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed for 30 men who underwent simultaneous PSMA PET-MR imaging for staging of prostate cancer. Thirty texture features were derived from each manually contoured T2-weighted, transaxial, prostatic TZ using texture analysis software which applies a spatial band-pass filter and quantifies texture through histogram analysis. Texture features of the TZ were compared to PSMA expression on the corresponding PET images. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction controlled the false discovery rate at <5%. RESULTS: 88 T2-weighted images in 18 patients demonstrated abnormal PSMA expression within the TZ on PET-MR. 123 images were PSMA negative. Based on the corrected p-value of 0.005, significant differences between the PSMA positive and negative slices were found for 16 texture parameters: Standard Deviation and Mean of Positive Pixels for all spatial filters (p=<0.0001 for both at all spatial scaling factor {SSF} values) and Mean Intensity following filtration for SSF 3-6mm (p=0.0002 0.0018). CONCLUSION: Abnormal expression of PSMA within the TZ is associated with altered texture on T2weighted MR, providing validation of MRTA for the detection of TZ prostate cancer.",2018,,,,f20bf69cbd0b37ccda2c29901439b88aa79fe5bc; 3640663a397dbdf340c10aa95d98a04457422637; c436851fd97c73204dd01003c4efa52106d0536a; e6e216cf0ac675af64e4a8b4dbbc0af9e1fcec28; d830afc0ae4681d3713c9ef76a19037d6b6c6236; 71dc285a4562efee46dbb5c29f8473293f54f836; 6d8185e426623b5c2cb945095096dfdfaefe9e88; e0649116628c85b35e91b148d47c88d334d9eb37; a41fee5d893012694755456c3ad331f4b32f8c20,,,
30d88b859633dedf4c1f66f67c94ad20f4955cd9,Lâ€Dopa responsiveness is associated with distinctive connectivity patterns in advanced Parkinson's disease,"BACKGROUND
Neuronal loss and dopamine depletion alter motor signal processing between cortical motor areas, basal ganglia, and the thalamus, resulting in the motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease. Dopamine replacement therapy can reverse these manifestations with varying degrees of improvement.


METHODS
To evaluate functional connectivity in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and changes in functional connectivity in relation to the degree of response to l-dopa, 19 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in the on-medication state. Scans were obtained on a 3-Tesla scanner in 3â€‰Ã—â€‰3â€‰Ã—â€‰2.5â€‰mm3 voxels. Seed-based bivariate regression analyses were carried out with atlas-defined basal ganglia regions as seeds, to explore relationships between functional connectivity and improvement in the motor section of the UPDRS-III following an l-dopa challenge. False discovery rate-corrected P was set atâ€‰<â€‰0.05 for a 2-tailed t test.


RESULTS
A greater improvement in UPDRS-III scores following l-dopa administration was characterized by higher resting-state functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and the striatum (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001) and lower resting-state functional connectivity between the pallidum (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), subthalamic nucleus (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.003), and the paracentral lobule (supplementary motor area, mesial primary motor, and primary sensory areas).


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings show characteristic basal ganglia resting-state functional connectivity patterns associated with different degrees of l-dopa responsiveness in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. l-Dopa exerts a graduated influence on remapping connectivity in distinct motor control networks, potentially explaining some of the variance in treatment response.

TGF-Î² signalling is involved in pathogenesis and progress of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This bioinformatics study consequently aims to determine the underlying molecular mechanism of TGF-Î² activation in HCC cells.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Dataset GSE10393 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, including 2 Huh-7 (HCC cell line) samples treated by TGF-Î² (100 pmol/L, 48 h) and 2 untreated samples. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using Limma package (false discovery rate < 0.05 and |log2 fold change| > 1.5), and then enrichment analyses of function, pathway, and disease were performed. In addition, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed based on the PPI data from multiple databases including INACT, MINT, BioGRID, UniProt, BIND, BindingDB, and SPIKE databases. Transcription factor (Tf)-DEG pairs (Bonferroni adjusted p-value < 0.01) from ChEA database and DEG-DEG pairs were used to construct TF-DEG regulatory network. Furthermore, TF-pathway-DEG complex network was constructed by integrating DEG-DEG pairs, TF-DEG pairs, and DEG-pathway pairs.


RESULTS
Totally, 209 DEGs and 30 TFs were identified. The DEGs were significantly enriched in adhesion-related functions. PPI network indicted hub genes such as CUL4Band NEDD4. According to the TF-DEG regulatory network, the two hub genes were targeted by SMAD2, SMAD3, and HNF4A. Besides, the 11 pathways in TF-pathway-DEG network were mainly enriched by UGT1Afamily and CYP3A7, which were predicted to be regulated by SMAD2, SMAD3, SOX2, TP63, and HNF4A.


CONCLUSIONS
TGF-Î² might influence biological processes of HCC cells via SMAD2/SMAD3-NEDD4, HNF4A-CUL4B/NEDD4, SOX2/TP63/HNF4A-CYP3A7, and SMAD2/SMAD3/SOX2/TP63/HNF4A-UGT1As regulatory pathways.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhaowei Qu"", ids = ""46988987""); list(name = ""Di Li"", ids = ""1802612""); list(name = ""Haitao Xu"", ids = ""1895598""); list(name = ""Rujia Zhang"", ids = ""11727300""); list(name = ""Bing Jin Li"", ids = ""144772607""); list(name = ""Chengming Sun"", ids = ""1821130""); list(name = ""Wei Dong"", ids = ""144980063""); list(name = ""Yubao Zhang"", ids = ""2988469"")",,,Annals of hepatology,15 4,"

cbf862a44b0ac4f999e502425c042ce9f94f0943,Propensity Score-Based Approaches in High Dimension for Pharmacovigilance Signal Detection: an Empirical Comparison on the French Spontaneous Reporting Database,"Classical methods used for signal detection in pharmacovigilance rely on disproportionality analysis of counts aggregating spontaneous reports of a given adverse drug reaction. In recent years, alternative methods have been proposed to analyze individual spontaneous reports such as penalized multiple logistic regression approaches. These approaches address some well-known biases resulting from disproportionality methods. However, while penalization accounts for computational constraints due to high-dimensional data, it raises the issue of determining the regularization parameter and eventually that of an error-controlling decision rule. We present a new automated signal detection strategy for pharmacovigilance systems, based on propensity scores (PS) in high dimension. PSs are increasingly used to assess a given association with high-dimensional observational healthcare databases in accounting for confusion bias. Our main aim was to develop a method having the same advantages as multiple regression approaches in dealing with bias, while relying on the statistical multiple comparison framework as regards decision thresholds, by considering false discovery rate (FDR)-based decision rules. We investigate four PS estimation methods in high dimension: a gradient tree boosting (GTB) algorithm from machine-learning and three variable selection algorithms. For each (drug, adverse event) pair, the PS is then applied as adjustment covariate or by using two kinds of weighting: inverse proportional treatment weighting and matching weights. The different versions of the new approach were compared to a univariate approach, which is a disproportionality method, and to two penalized multiple logistic regression approaches, directly applied on spontaneous reporting data. Performance was assessed through an empirical comparative study conducted on a reference signal set in the French national pharmacovigilance database (2000-2016) that was recently proposed for drug-induced liver injury. Multiple regression approaches performed better in detecting true positives and false positives. Nonetheless, the performances of the PS-based methods using matching weights was very similar to that of multiple regression and better than with the univariate approach. In addition to being able to control FDR statistical errors, the proposed PS-based strategy is an interesting alternative to multiple regression approaches.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ã‰meline Courtois"", ids = ""51291454""); list(name = ""Antoine Pariente"", ids = ""1955245""); list(name = ""Francesco Salvo"", ids = ""3476999""); list(name = ""Ã‰tienne Volatier"", ids = ""51287299""); list(name = ""Pascale Tubert-Bitter"", ids = ""1398734189""); list(name = ""IsmaÃ¯l Ahmed"", ids = ""2802717"")",f9b1139260ab3d0eae2320c08725bb5fb95f65a0; b4977a4bca5cd2eaf00b4d612c20cdd7a23cae8a,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4017704a32e18da6e57bb39a3c77ec553dc78114; 0ecf8c56300c20622f317e1e6cefdeeb85c513e2; 2c65e74142ac0fe999212ec1d60346520a6a9190; 94ef23b86a4fd9f05f377560dcfd00268e1001c6; bf78a18dd547155c83eda81de3fb75321ef143e5; ace06c445ecbd48c222268ad7290632557c7e86f; adebf3c77ba07cc149ee1c27f7a3bfba5ad05ab6; 4ee24f2cc25f84a4a40491efba11c63310003cdc; 359a2fc4a44e90f03d79401af0d68a2f4e8a3f93; fc03abb0fa5fd0281b966545bd016e9cb950526e; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 1cb694d39a3fe5ddd2a76ed4f7e98de9647a5b4a; f0b25b16bdcb7b6418e284255b9e2ba32a7585d4; 8d19635c86977ca55f2863ee1d4acab06498a961; 3e9a0801bd1a6557a8e60e3ee457b66377ed4948; 2f4d0f1b26500375c55a83855e2ce0b3f665229c; 81719e267980178e410b4bb9bbd92fcfebb0f828; c104df9aabcd2e38345cbf5387b1bb4acc38ccc0; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; d897b2aafee70e1b52a5f064f8d8c9655a9282a0; e6381f459117d05288178b16cc18a5a92d36d881; 5958031ab33bbfeb51b3323079019dacd6635002; 8b36088fbe43f731c9d8afb7b8c5f67e536a6566; ab4b156d0d6d598cfb366d5fd0e1091f48d0376d; 33883ef563e6b9ced8c319ec73d5af606f4eaf09; f25007026feb9d6b388ac526f95e38c331fb2348,Frontiers in Pharmacology,9,
8d059e2b6ee45b8470013fbb984557295d94cc3f,Gene expression signatures differentiate ovarian/peritoneal serous carcinoma from breast carcinoma in effusions,"Ovarian/primary peritoneal carcinoma and breast carcinoma are the gynaecological cancers that most frequently involve the serosal cavities. With the objective of improving on the limited diagnostic panel currently available for the differential diagnosis of these two malignancies, as well as to define tumour-specific biological targets, we compared their global gene expression patterns. Gene expression profiles of 10 serous ovarian/peritoneal and eight ductal breast carcinoma effusions were analysed using the HumanRef-8 BeadChip from Illumina. Differentially expressed candidate genes were validated using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using all 54,675 genes in the array separated ovarian from breast carcinoma samples. We identified 288 unique probes that were significantly differentially expressed in the two cancers by greater than 3.5-fold, of which 81 and 207 were overexpressed in breast and ovarian/peritoneal carcinoma, respectively. SAM analysis identified 1078 differentially expressed probes with false discovery rate less than 0.05. Genes overexpressed in breast carcinoma included TFF1, TFF3, FOXA1, CA12, GATA3, SDC1, PITX1, TH, EHFD1, EFEMP1, TOB1 and KLF2. Genes overexpressed in ovarian/peritoneal carcinoma included SPON1, RBP1, MFGE8, TM4SF12, MMP7, KLK5/6/7, FOLR1/3, PAX8, APOL2 and NRCAM. The differential expression of 14 genes was validated by quantitative real-time PCR, and differences in 5 gene products were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Expression profiling distinguishes ovarian/peritoneal carcinoma from breast carcinoma and identifies genes that are differentially expressed in these two tumour types. The molecular signatures unique to these cancers may facilitate their differential diagnosis and may provide a molecular basis for therapeutic target discovery.",2010,Biology,"list(name = ""Ben Davidson"", ids = ""2035651""); list(name = ""Helene Tuft Stavnes"", ids = ""7859303""); list(name = ""Arild Holth"", ids = ""4026753""); list(name = ""Xu Chen"", ids = ""48283103""); list(name = ""Yanqin Yang"", ids = ""51285939""); list(name = ""Ie Ming Shih"", ids = ""4188458""); list(name = ""Tian-Li Wang"", ids = ""3287681"")",86303f6ae5de35ea6b17e3665e7af84fbd975778; 604b456b84d501280d4bb1871fb8ced4e3aa2f6f; fa95aacfa63314a09a4b62d9e221f11883ca54a3; a8d2f79cdc092acb6dcd52d53c1c0406b17bb53b; 8fe8de841641c74fa5796721e1a19a827b35b261; 30c1ee47d267d74113433d2a0f2d2ff5775a82ff; 90ca7b0c4b4ef20bf8d954c8030c1f0abaed95cf; ec4410cef5ab60a95770f7cfa95c23884b1a7f11; 47a3975a7103be75d83cf8c94b815abf99e53368; 09abffaae59a33398422e6fa819dabb004a5e4d0; 6c1248c2f13e9960c9a4a9f5c2f6d96bb83f6d3c; 2813a1a113afe46717dacdd39d6bc17480a51e19; b7121ae432dfa4f8d71c92027373c8d0088e6323; 0cca98b7b7dab925b33c23c85eec85dc0404a0fa; 3fc7d456fd4fe2a428a8697530ce11be8b482872; cdb627eff8825044f091915632a05a6120550881; cfe572460bc93a1d33f81e41b98440fa14f98b3e; c4e430f091e7094084e00c5a723a37cb0145139e; fde11b7091f4a977cd118bcfa14fe42479fd083e; 40e6baa731a46c8e40c3eca07f052da64ff76e3c; dee223f8278bb8cc358470446a32d96f269c2754; 6426c87ac7f896dfd63c775a00673c74c81bbd52; deb32e74ddd6d338dcea4915fd3b1467f3b07a46; 6b03eddc92cfd0f189f7cb2c30d26c4bae129db1; c6c3988bff72eb029462066cd7a7f12ca28456ce; 87f51e17d1ac9c942f118cd3e796bedd734b4e18,,Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine,15,535 - 544
88a541485baa4c817af257963652b32de169cc37,"Integrated Strategy for Unknown EI-MS Identification Using Quality Control Calibration Curve, Multivariate Analysis, EI-MS Spectral Database, and Retention Index Prediction.","Compound identification using unknown electron ionization (EI) mass spectra in gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is challenging in untargeted metabolomics, natural product chemistry, or exposome research. While the total count of EI-MS records included in publicly or commercially available databases is over 900â€¯000, efficient use of this huge database has not been achieved in metabolomics. Therefore, we proposed a ""four-step"" strategy for the identification of biologically significant metabolites using an integrated cheminformatics approach: (i) quality control calibration curve to reduce background noise, (ii) variable selection by hypothesis testing in principal component analysis for the efficient selection of target peaks, (iii) searching the EI-MS spectral database, and (iv) retention index (RI) filtering in combination with RI predictions. In this study, the new MS-FINDER spectral search engine was developed and utilized for searching EI-MS databases using mass spectral similarity with the evaluation of false discovery rate. Moreover, in silico derivatization software, MetaboloDerivatizer, was developed to calculate the chemical properties of derivative compounds, and all retention indexes in EI-MS databases were predicted using a simple mathematical model. The strategy was showcased in the identification of three novel metabolites (butane-1,2,3-triol, 3-deoxyglucosone, and palatinitol) in Chinese medicine Senkyu for quality assessment, as validated using authentic standard compounds.

b3fa25324b18cc2fea75a0b53a1622cba525117c,An informatics-assisted label-free quantitation strategy that depicts phosphoproteomic profiles in lung cancer cell invasion.,"Aberrant protein phosphorylation plays important roles in cancer-related cell signaling. With the goal of achieving multiplexed, comprehensive, and fully automated relative quantitation of site-specific phosphorylation, we present a simple label-free strategy combining an automated pH/acid-controlled IMAC procedure and informatics-assisted SEMI (sequence, elution time, mass-to-charge, and internal standard) algorithm. The SEMI strategy effectively increased the number of quantifiable peptides more than 4-fold in replicate experiments (from 262 to 1171, p < 0.05, false discovery rate = 0.46%) by using a fragmental regression algorithm for elution time alignment followed by peptide cross-assignment in all LC-MS/MS runs. In addition, the strategy demonstrated good quantitation accuracy (10-12%) for standard phosphoprotein and variation less than 1.9 fold (within 99% confidence range) in proteome scale and reliable linear quantitation correlation (R(2) = 0.99) with 4000-fold dynamic concentrations, which was attributed to our reproducible experimental procedure and informatics-assisted peptide alignment tool to minimize system variations. In an attempt to explore metastasis-associated phosphoproteomic alterations in lung cancer, this approach was used to delineate differential phosphoproteomic profiles of a lung cancer metastasis model. Without sample fractionation, the SEMI algorithm enabled quantification of 1796 unique phosphopeptides (false discovery rate = 0.56%) corresponding to 854 phosphoproteins from a series of non-small cell lung cancer lines with varying degrees of in vivo invasiveness. Nearly 40% of the phosphopeptides showed >2-fold change in highly invasive cells; validation of phosphoprotein subsets by Western blotting not only demonstrated the consistency of data obtained by our SEMI strategy but also revealed that such dramatic changes in the phosphoproteome result mostly from translational or post-translational regulation. Mapping of these differentially expressed phosphoproteins in multiple cellular pathways related to cancer invasion and metastasis suggests that the site and degree of phosphorylation might have distinct patterns or functions in the complex process of cancer progression.",2010,Medicine;

0a7bffe3a4615fec4140e002669ded740cf6510b,A new correction for controlling family-wise error rate in multiple comparison studies,Misleading conclusions can be drawn from multiple comparison studies if the critical p value is set as equivalent to the preselected statistical Î± level. This incorrect assumption is observed in many research publications where not enough attention was paid to the inflation of the critical p value as a result of increasing the number of comparisons. A new approach is proposed to control the false discovery rate for independent comparisons. The new approach renders more reliable critical p values and allows reducing the inflated values to the original preselected Î± level.,2020,Engineering,"list(name = ""Pedro Araujo"", ids = ""144302350"")",,60306cbf6056f490478bd760d04bbc43a5e79b8c; 3d3b2a4f1ae4e029a43c22171cb61f3c56516d72,Accreditation and Quality Assurance,25,167 - 169
2a989b0042c90390320edc2bebf123f241e3a547,GaMRedâ€”Adaptive Filtering of High-Throughput Biological Data,"Data filtering based on removing non-informative features, with unchanged signal between compared experimental conditions, can significantly increase sensitivity of methods used to detect differentially expressed genes or other molecular components measured in high-throughput biological experiments. Criteria for data filtering can be stated on the basis of averages or variances of signal levels across samples. The crucial parts of feature filtering are selection of filter type and cut-off threshold, which are specific to the particular dataset. In this paper, we present an algorithm and a stand-alone application, GaMRed, for adaptive filtering insignificant features in high-throughput data, based on Gaussian mixture decomposition. We have tested the performance of our algorithm using datasets from three different high-throughput biological experiments. We estimated the number of differentially expressed features after applying multiple testing correction and performed functional analysis of obtained features using Gene Ontology terms. Also, we checked if the control of false discovery rate and family-wise error rate after applying feature filtering remains at appropriate level. GaMRed is fast, automatic, and does not require expert knowledge in parameter tuning. The algorithm increases sensitivity of methods used to find differentially expressed features and biological validity of the findings.

Methods:Twenty-one subjects with aMCI were identified from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's research program who remained clinically stable for their entire observed clinical course (aMCI-S), where the minimum required follow-up time from MRI to last follow-up assessment was 3 years. These subjects were age- and gender-matched to 42 aMCI subjects who progressed to AD within 18 months of the MRI (aMCI-P). Each subject was then age- and gender-matched to a control subject. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to assess patterns of gray matter atrophy in the aMCI-P and aMCI-S groups compared to the control group, and compared to each other. Results:The aMCI-P group showed bilateral loss affecting the medial and inferior temporal lobe, temporoparietal association neocortex, and frontal lobes, compared to controls. The aMCI-S group showed no regions of gray matter loss when compared to controls. When the aMCI-P and aMCI-S groups were compared directly, the aMCI-P group showed greater loss in the medial and inferior temporal lobes, the temporoparietal neocortex, posterior cingulate, precuneus, anterior cingulate, and frontal lobes than the aMCI-S group. Conclusions:The regions of loss observed in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) who progressed to Alzheimer disease (AD) within 18 months of the MRI are typical of subjects with AD. The lack of gray matter loss in subjects with aMCI who remained clinically stable for their entire observed clinical course is consistent with the notion that patterns of atrophy on MRI at baseline map well onto the subsequent clinical course.

36b736da5f4f4d0696d9e2038337f6d9b409e14d,Detecting organisational innovations leading to improved ICU outcomes: a protocol for a double-blinded national positive deviance study of critical care delivery,"INTRODUCTION
There is substantial variability in intensive care unit (ICU) utilisation and quality of care. However, the factors that drive this variation are poorly understood. This study uses a novel adaptation of positive deviance approach-a methodology used in public health that assumes solutions to challenges already exist within the system to detect innovations that are likely to improve intensive care.


METHODS AND ANALYSIS
We used the Philips eICU Research Institute database, containing 3.3â€‰million patient records from over 50 health systems across the USA. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IVa scores were used to identify the study cohort, which included ICU patients whose outcomes were felt to be most sensitive to organisational innovations. The primary outcomes included mortality and length of stay. Outcome measurements were directly standardised, and bootstrapped CIs were calculated with adjustment for false discovery rate. Using purposive sampling, we then generated a blinded list of five positive outliers and five negative comparators.Using rapid qualitative inquiry (RQI), blinded interdisciplinary site visit teams will conduct interviews and observations using a team ethnography approach. After data collection is completed, the data will be unblinded and analysed using a cross-case method to identify themes, patterns and innovations using a constant comparative grounded theory approach. This process detects the innovations in intensive care and supports an evaluation of how positive deviance and RQI methods can be adapted to healthcare.


ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION
The study protocol was approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board (reference: 39509).

ae9aa4ab9c0fb7a77158e8929de8f7036f2bdb6c,Decreased microbial co-occurrence network stability and SCFA receptor level correlates with obesity in African-origin women,"We compared the gut microbial populations in 100 women, from rural Ghana and urban US [50% lean (BMIâ€‰<â€‰25â€‰kg/m2) and 50% obese (BMIâ€‰â‰¥â€‰30â€‰kg/m2)] to examine the ecological co-occurrence network topology of the gut microbiota as well as the relationship of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) with obesity. Ghanaians consumed significantly more dietary fiber, had greater microbial alpha-diversity, different beta-diversity, and had a greater concentration of total fecal SCFAs (p-valueâ€‰<â€‰0.002). Lean Ghanaians had significantly greater network density, connectivity and stability than either obese Ghanaians, or lean and obese US participants (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-valueâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.01). Bacteroides uniformis was significantly more abundant in lean women, irrespective of country (FDR corrected pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), while lean Ghanaians had a significantly greater proportion of Ruminococcus callidus, Prevotella copri, and Escherichia coli, and smaller proportions of Lachnospiraceae, Bacteroides and Parabacteroides. Lean Ghanaians had a significantly greater abundance of predicted microbial genes that catalyzed the production of butyric acid via the fermentation of pyruvate or branched amino-acids, while obese Ghanaians and US women (irrespective of BMI) had a significantly greater abundance of predicted microbial genes that encoded for enzymes associated with the fermentation of amino-acids such as alanine, aspartate, lysine and glutamate. Similar to lean Ghanaian women, mice humanized with stool from the lean Ghanaian participant had a significantly lower abundance of family Lachnospiraceae and genus Bacteroides and Parabacteroides, and were resistant to obesity following 6-weeks of high fat feeding (p-valueâ€‰<â€‰0.01). Obesity-resistant mice also showed increased intestinal transcriptional expression of the free fatty acid (Ffa) receptor Ffa2, in spite of similar fecal SCFAs concentrations. We demonstrate that the association between obesity resistance and increased predicted ecological connectivity and stability of the lean Ghanaian microbiota, as well as increased local SCFA receptor level, provides evidence of the importance of robust gut ecologic network in obesity.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lara R.

We investigated the self-renewal capabilities of the various hematopoietic cell types derived from Mll-AF9 knock-in mice. We used the murine knock-in model since it offers the advantage of a single copy of the Mll -fusion gene under the control of the endogenous promoter present in every hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell. In methylcellulose cultures, we compared myeloid colony formation of Mll-AF9 cells to wild type progenitor populations over three generations of plating. In the first generation of plating, the Mll-AF9 common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) formed more colonies than the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs). However, at the third generation of plating, colony numbers formed by Mll-AF9 HSCs and CLPs were significantly greater than those formed by CMPs and GMPs. By the third generation only occasional colonies were found in the wild type groups. These results demonstrate that while Mll-AF9 led to an increase in self-renewal of all 4 cell types studied, these effects were more pronounced in HSCs and CLPs. To identify the downstream genes that mediate the growth deregulatory effects of Mll-AF9, we compared gene expression profiles of Mll-AF9 derived cells to their wild type counterparts. To assess gene expression levels, we extracted RNA from wild type and Mll-AF9 HSCs, CLPs, CMPs and GMPs. We then amplified and labeled the RNA for analysis by Affymetrix murine 430 2.0 genome arrays. In an unsupervised analysis, the various Mll-AF9 cells clustered with their corresponding wild type counterparts, indicating that the expression of most genes was not significantly altered by Mll-AF9. To identify the genes that are differentially expressed in the Mll-AF9 derived cells, we performed a two-way ANOVA (with the genotype and cell type as the two variables) allowing for a false discovery rate of 10%. In this analysis, we found that 76 genes were up-regulated in all Mll-AF9 progenitor cells compared to their wild-type counterparts. This list included known targets of Mll-fusion proteins Hoxa5, Hoxa7, Hoxa9 and Hoxa10 . Also included were Evi1 and Mef2c , two genes that have been implicated in promoting enhanced self-renewal of murine hematopoietic cells. Importantly, in wild type mice, these 6 genes were expressed at higher levels in HSCs and CLPs compared to CMPs and GMPs (average 3â€“25 fold). While we observed an average 2â€“10 fold increase in expression of these genes in all Mll-AF9 cell types compared to their respective wild type controls, the expression level was 3â€“8 fold higher in Mll-AF9 HSCs and CLPs compared to CMPs and GMPs. Thus, the expression of genes known to be intrinsically related to self-renewal is further enhanced as a result of the Mll-AF9 fusion gene. In conclusion, while activation of the Mll-AF9 genetic program and the resulting enhanced self-renewal occurs in all 4 cell types studied, these effects are greatest in HSCs and CLPs. Thus, HSCs and CLPs are likely to be more efficient than CMPs and GMPs in producing cellular expansion and targets for cooperating mutations resulting in leukemia.",2006,Biology,"list(name = ""Ashish Kumar"", ids = ""40080943""); list(name = ""Wendy A.

The purpose of the present study was to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to myocardial infarction (MI) in Japanese individuals.


METHODS
The study population comprised 5014 Japanese individuals, including 1444 subjects with MI and 3570 controls. The 150 polymorphisms examined in the present study were selected by a genome-wide association study for ischemic stroke with the use of the GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set (Affymetrix), and were determined by a method that combines the polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes with suspension array technology.


RESULTS
An initial screen by the chi-square test revealed that the A-->G polymorphism of SEMA3F (rs12632110), the C-->T polymorphism of CLEC16A (rs9925481), the A-->G polymorphism of LAMA3 (rs12373237), and the C-->G polymorphism of PCSK2 (rs6080699) were significantly (false discovery rate for allele frequencies of <0.05) associated with MI. Subsequent multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates and a stepwise forward selection procedure revealed that the A-->G polymorphism of SEMA3F (dominant model; P=0.0014; odds ratio, 0.76), the C-->T polymorphism of CLEC16A (dominant model; P=0.0009; odds ratio, 0.75), the A-->G polymorphism of LAMA3 (recessive model; P=0.0099; odds ratio, 0.80), and the C-->G polymorphism of PCSK2 (recessive model; P=0.0155; odds ratio, 1.19) were significantly (P<0.05) associated with the prevalence of MI.


CONCLUSION
Determination of these genotypes may prove informative for assessment of the genetic risk for MI in Japanese individuals.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tetsuo Fujimaki"", ids = ""49996701""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Kiyoshi Yokoi"", ids = ""2332668""); list(name = ""Mitsutoshi Oguri"", ids = ""5005355""); list(name = ""Tetsuro Yoshida"", ids = ""9796442""); list(name = ""Sachiro Watanabe"", ids = ""66974556""); list(name = ""Norifumi Metoki"", ids = ""6157218""); list(name = ""Hidemi Yoshida"", ids = ""153124940""); list(name = ""Kei Satoh"", ids = ""49245021""); list(name = ""Yukitoshi Aoyagi"", ids = ""5446851""); list(name = ""Yoshinori Nozawa"", ids = ""7197365""); list(name = ""Genjiro Kimura"", ids = ""144734121""); list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711"")",93c2f2889ce5a2a3bb30bcbe67f6f3f71721e267; b4975c57f21922446df9ebbc7577ff69479a398a; ca82adba822cd5d316ddcac50da5efe5434a86f4; 78f42250f31592c2e60f8adedbc2059996468976; 90cddde9bf3c63ca4da7f968022a9fdc28d95520; 46c92b63ce39fad9325ceae6741222d2c7e64c55; af3aea0937cbf323224a704f8034aa027bcc91ce; ba909806093e46d206b89574407e86101a454dd0,4406a4ea9cc265888f75d36d942f0af6c28c8244; 7580de09a0b98c4309090f6988d963d7c8c1fc9d; 15428b611f4dc565b437064d6d67ac0dfdc439e8; 65b9993059c5f6baa2b919bb3b3e0f6976299d20; d93e1cd1cb792fc43c182833bf5156fcae592441; cb6614a033c4044a8aca23e41ece022bc1476a77; f65af859ec0401df3c2210e40d2924f34103e2db; 26490d36ddf87e9eccf37f25bc943c61b1474beb; 6a8485d2ebf5a22cadfc734a77fef2708a6af686; 3b0528b12ad9da2c5f4eef0050539a1c96950210; 3d223f4994e2164b1e8f6adb58f3727f0bd5ba6c; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 04e7ee38f90942bc51ca7a6f09ffd37bdd867c2e; 423df7d78cd7e556c7e7ef351a9081aa80496668; fe3739e41d878342a6dc8616b0182970c4044bdd; 5aaafa212640191412c214f54eb5e044599f05ba; bae217599597786c3925088435eefbda24970706,Atherosclerosis,210 2,"

The current peak detection procedure in SPM12 requires a pre-threshold for approximating p-values and a false discovery rate (FDR) nominal level for inference.

However, sex differences in aging-related phenotypes and mortality could suggest a critical role of the sex chromosomes in the aging process. We obtained blood-based DNA methylation data on the Y chromosome for 624 men from four cohorts and performed a chromosome-wide epigenetic association analysis to detect Y-linked CpGs differentially methylated over age and cross-validated the significant CpGs in the four cohorts. We identified 40-219 significant CpG sites (false discovery rate <0.05) with >82% of them hypermethylated with increasing age, which is in strong contrast to the patterns reported on the autosomal chromosomes. Comparing the rate of change in the Y-linked DNA methylation across cohorts that represent different age intervals revealed a trend of acceleration in DNA methylation with increasing age. The age-dependent DNA methylation patterns on the Y chromosome were further examined for their association with all-cause mortality with results suggesting that the predominant pattern of age-related hypermethylation on the Y chromosome is associated with reduced risk of death.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jesper Beltoft Lund"", ids = ""145469170""); list(name = ""Shuxia Li"", ids = ""48831092""); list(name = ""Kaare Christensen"", ids = ""144061761""); list(name = ""Jonas Mengel-From"", ids = ""1399234488""); list(name = ""Mette Soerensen"", ids = ""4981442""); list(name = ""Riccardo E.

ef8b59845865c7d03414667a53adcccc15666a78,Power and sample size estimation in microarray studies,"BackgroundBefore conducting a microarray experiment, one important issue that needs to be determined is the number of arrays required in order to have adequate power to identify differentially expressed genes. This paper discusses some crucial issues in the problem formulation, parameter specifications, and approaches that are commonly proposed for sample size estimation in microarray experiments. Common methods for sample size estimation are formulated as the minimum sample size necessary to achieve a specified sensitivity (proportion of detected truly differentially expressed genes) on average at a specified false discovery rate (FDR) level and specified expected proportion (Ï€1) of the true differentially expression genes in the array. Unfortunately, the probability of detecting the specified sensitivity in such a formulation can be low. We formulate the sample size problem as the number of arrays needed to achieve a specified sensitivity with 95% probability at the specified significance level. A permutation method using a small pilot dataset to estimate sample size is proposed. This method accounts for correlation and effect size heterogeneity among genes.ResultsA sample size estimate based on the common formulation, to achieve the desired sensitivity on average, can be calculated using a univariate method without taking the correlation among genes into consideration. This formulation of sample size problem is inadequate because the probability of detecting the specified sensitivity can be lower than 50%. On the other hand, the needed sample size calculated by the proposed permutation method will ensure detecting at least the desired sensitivity with 95% probability. The method is shown to perform well for a real example dataset using a small pilot dataset with 4-6 samples per group.ConclusionsWe recommend that the sample size problem should be formulated to detect a specified proportion of differentially expressed genes with 95% probability. This formulation ensures finding the desired proportion of true positives with high probability. The proposed permutation method takes the correlation structure and effect size heterogeneity into consideration and works well using only a small pilot dataset.",2009,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Wei-Jiun Lin"", ids = ""2731886""); list(name = ""Huey-miin Hsueh"", ids = ""38211103""); list(name = ""James J.

214e0ffa3368a65bd67ff3baaa318a571545f4c0,Transcriptome analysis of chronic lymphoid leukemia reveals isoform regulation associated with mutations in SF 3 B 1,"Genome sequence studies of chronic lympoid leukemia (CLL) have provided a comprehensive overview of recurrent somatic mutations in coding genes. One of the most intriguing discoveries has been the prevalence of mutations in the HEAT-repeat domain of the splicing factor SF3B1. A frequently observed variant is predicted to cause the substitution of a lysine with a glutamic acid at position 700 of the protein (K700E). However, the molecular consequences of the mutations and their contribution to the cancer phenotype are largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the consequences of the K700E mutation in SF3B1 on transcript isoform regulation in CLL. We sequenced the transcriptomes of six samples: four CLL tumour cells, of which two contained the K700E mutation in SF3B1, and CD19 positive cells from two healthy donors. We identified 41 genes that showed differential usage of exons associated with the mutated status of SF3B1 (false discovery rate 10%). These genes were enriched in pathways including â€interferon signalingâ€ and â€mRNA splicingâ€. Additionally, we found evidence of differential exon usage of the genes UQCC and RPL31 as a consequence of mutations in SF3B1 in our CLL data; notably, a similar effect on these genes was described in a previously published study of uveal melanoma. These data provide an initial view of transcript isoform consequences of the SF3B1 (K700E) mutation in CLL, some of which might contribute to the tumourigenesis of CLL. Studies of larger cohorts and model systems are required to extend these findings.",2013,,"list(name = ""Alejandro Reyes"", ids = ""144285115""); list(name = ""Carolin Blume"", ids = ""50404910""); list(name = ""Vicent Pelechano"", ids = ""4793493""); list(name = ""Petra Jakob"", ids = ""31827446""); list(name = ""Lars M.

20465cff4db669ef1819124be50e78a943a6b5b5,Common genetic variants in the 8q24 region and risk of papillary thyroid cancer.,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 8q24 chromosomal region identified from genome-wide scans have been associated with the risk of several cancers, including breast (rs1562430), prostate (rs1447295), and colon (rs6983267). A genome-wide scan in 26 families with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) also found susceptibility loci in 8q24, supporting a closer evaluation of this chromosomal region in relation to the risk of sporadic PTC.


STUDY DESIGN
Case-control study.


METHODS
We evaluated 157 tag SNPs in the 8q24 chromosomal region between 120.91 Mb and 128.78 Mb (including rs1562430, rs1447295, and rs6983267) in a case-control study of 344 PTC cases and 452 age and gender frequency-matched controls. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and compute P values of linear trend for PTC with genotypes of interest. To account for multiple comparisons, we applied the false discovery rate (FDR) method.


RESULTS
We did not find a significant association between rs1562430, rs1447295, or rs6983267 and PTC risk. We found that one SNP (rs4733616) was associated with PTC risk at P = .003, and 12 other SNPs were associated with PTC risk at P < .05. However, no SNPs remained significant after FDR correction.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings do not support a strong association between SNPs in the 8q24 chromosomal region and risk of sporadic PTC, but several SNPs with small effects might exist.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Gila I.

We used standardized shotgun proteomics and targeted protein quantitation platforms to analyze a panel of 10 colon cancer cell lines differing by mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. In addition, we performed transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to enable detection of protein sequence variants from the proteomic data. Biologic replicate cultures yielded highly consistent proteomic inventories with a cumulative total of 6,513 protein groups with a protein false discovery rate of 3.17% across all cell lines. Networks of coexpressed proteins with differential expression based on MMR status revealed impact on protein folding, turnover and transport, on cellular metabolism and on DNA and RNA synthesis and repair. Analysis of variant amino acid sequences suggested higher stability of proteins affected by naturally occurring germline polymorphisms than of proteins affected by somatic protein sequence changes. The data provide evidence for multisystem adaptation to MMR deficiency with a stress response that targets misfolded proteins for degradation through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. Enrichment analysis suggested epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in RKO cells, as evidenced by increased mobility and invasion properties compared with SW480. The observed proteomic profiles demonstrate previously unknown consequences of altered DNA repair and provide an expanded basis for mechanistic interpretation of MMR phenotypes.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Patrick J.

ebd24ef0917f6742b0f2cab7ff3a30f4b02e1e1b,New risk and protective factors for severe hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes.,"AIMS
To evaluate risk factors for severe hypoglycaemia (SH) in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM).


METHODS AND RESULTS
Retrospective observational and comparative study. All SH occurring between 2007 and 2014 in a German population (Lippe-Detmold) were captured. Characteristics of patients with T1DM and SH were compared with a control group being equivalent concerning age, diabetes duration, HbA1c, comorbidity, and Î²-blocker treatment. SH was defined as a symptomatic event requiring treatment with intravenous glucose or glucagon administration and being confirmed by a blood glucose measurement of <2.8Â mmol/l. Predictive factors for SH were analysed by a multivariable regression model. As many as 405 cases of SH in T1DM occurred in 206 subjects; 50% of episodes were related to 31 patients who experienced â‰¥3 SH. Need for nursing care (OR 4.88), treatment with NPH (OR 3.68), and impaired hypoglycaemia awareness (OR 2.06) were the strongest risk factors for SH (all pÂ <Â 0.05, all pFDR-adjustedÂ <Â 0.10; false discovery rate (FDR)). Depression (OR 0.14), treatment with CSII (OR 0.39) and short-acting insulin analogues (OR 0.31) appeared to be protective (all pÂ <Â 0.10; FDR-adjusted). The probability of SH onset was significantly higher in patients who had previously experienced recurrent SH episodes. Î²-Blocker treatment did not appear to be a risk factor.


CONCLUSION
The complex risk for SH in people with T1DM can be reduced by treatment with CSII and short-acting analogues. Future structures of diabetes care will be challenged by the need of treating increasingly geriatric subjects with T1DM having a high risk of SH.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tobias Wohland"", ids = ""32046515""); list(name = ""J D Holstein"", ids = ""32078597""); list(name = ""Olaf M Patzer"", ids = ""3543718""); list(name = ""Meinhard Mende"", ids = ""5315486""); list(name = ""Thomas K.

ABSTRACT Introduction Arising evidence suggests that resistance training has the potential to induce beneficial modulation of biomarker profile. To date, however, only immediate responses to resistance training have been investigated using high-throughput metabolomics whereas the effects of chronic resistance training on biomarker profile have not been studied in detail. Methods A total of 86 recreationally active healthy men without previous systematic resistance training background were allocated into (i) a resistance training (RT) group (n = 68; age, 33 Â± 7 yr; body mass index, 28 Â± 3 kgÂ·mâˆ’2) and (ii) a non-RT group (n = 18; age, 31 Â± 4 yr; body mass index, 27 Â± 3 kgÂ·mâˆ’2). Blood samples were collected at baseline (PRE), after 4 wk (POST-4wk), and after 16 wk of resistance training intervention (POST-16wk), as well as baseline and after the non-RT period (20â€“24 wk). Nuclear magnetic resonanceâ€“metabolome platform was used to determine metabolomic responses to chronic resistance training. Results Overall, the resistance training intervention resulted in favorable alterations (P < 0.05) in body composition with increased levels of lean mass (~2.8%), decreased levels of android (~9.6%), and total fat mass (~7.5%). These changes in body composition were accompanied by antiatherogenic alterations in serum metabolome profile (false discovery rate < 0.05) as reductions in nonâ€“high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (e.g., free cholesterol, remnant cholesterol, intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterols, low-density lipoprotein cholesterols) and related apolipoprotein B, and increments in conjugated linoleic fatty acids levels were observed. Individuals with the poorest baseline status (i.e., body composition, metabolome profile) benefitted the most from the resistance training intervention. Conclusions In conclusion, resistance training improves cardiometabolic risk factors and serum metabolome even in previously healthy young men. Thus, suggesting attenuated risk for future cardiovascular disease.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Heikki V.

This study was designed to investigate patterns of fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF, an indicator for the intensity of regional brain spontaneous activities) of patients with first-episode drug-naÃ¯ve panic disorder (PD).


METHODS
Thirty patients (17 females, 13 males, age: 47.70Â±10.69 years old) and twenty healthy controls (10 females, 10 males, age: 41.40Â±13.94 years old) received 3-Tesla resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RFMRI) scanning and the rating of clinical scales. RFMRI data was processed and analyzed by the REST toolbox (resting-state functional MRI data analysis toolbox) to calculate fALFF. fALFF were compared between patients and controls to detect endophenotype of fALFF in patients with first-episode drug-naÃ¯ve PD.


RESULTS
We found decreased fALFF in right middle occipital gyrus [FDR (false discovery rate) corrected p<0.05, cluster >5 voxles, volume >135mm(3), T threshold: 6.1168, surface connected theory] and increased fALFF in right putamen and right ventral lateral nucleus of thalamus of patients (uncorrected p<0.00005, cluster >5 voxles, volume >135mm(3), T threshold: 4.5439, surface connected theory). fALFF of patients also showed a positive correlation with clinical rating scores of PD in right cuneus.

To identify genes controlling resistance to soybean rust, transcriptome profiling was conducted in resistant and susceptible Glycine tomentella genotypes triggered by P. pachyrhizi infection. Among 38,400 genes monitored using a soybean microarray, at 5% false discovery rate, 1,342 genes were identified exhibiting significant differential expression between uninfected and P. pachyrhizi-infected leaves at 12, 24, 48, and 72Â h post-inoculation (hpi) in both rust-susceptible and rust-resistant genotypes. Differentially expressed genes were grouped into 12 functional categories, and among those, large numbers relate to basic plant metabolism. Transcripts for genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway were up-regulated early during rust infection. Similarly, genes coding for proteins related to stress and defense responses such as glutathione-S-transferases, peroxidases, heat shock proteins, and lipoxygenases were consistently up-regulated following infection at all four time points. Whereas, subsets of genes involved in cellular transport, cellular communication, cell cycle, and DNA processing were down-regulated. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on randomly selected genes from the different categories confirmed these findings. Of differentially expressed genes, those associated with the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway as well as those coding for peroxidases and lipoxygenases were likely to be involved in rust resistance in soybean, and would serve as good candidates for functional studies. These findings provided insights into mechanisms underlying resistance and general activation of plant defense pathways in response to rust infection.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ruth E.

672e502d51d59ad7e7473b14677c90aca833cd14,30-Day Survival Probabilities as a Quality Indicator for Norwegian Hospitals: Data Management and Analysis,"BACKGROUND
The Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services (NOKC) reports 30-day survival as a quality indicator for Norwegian hospitals. The indicators have been published annually since 2011 on the website of the Norwegian Directorate of Health (www.helsenorge.no), as part of the Norwegian Quality Indicator System authorized by the Ministry of Health. Openness regarding calculation of quality indicators is important, as it provides the opportunity to critically review and discuss the method. The purpose of this article is to describe the data collection, data pre-processing, and data analyses, as carried out by NOKC, for the calculation of 30-day risk-adjusted survival probability as a quality indicator.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
Three diagnosis-specific 30-day survival indicators (first time acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke and hip fracture) are estimated based on all-cause deaths, occurring in-hospital or out-of-hospital, within 30 days counting from the first day of hospitalization. Furthermore, a hospital-wide (i.e. overall) 30-day survival indicator is calculated. Patient administrative data from all Norwegian hospitals and information from the Norwegian Population Register are retrieved annually, and linked to datasets for previous years. The outcome (alive/death within 30 days) is attributed to every hospital by the fraction of time spent in each hospital. A logistic regression followed by a hierarchical Bayesian analysis is used for the estimation of risk-adjusted survival probabilities. A multiple testing procedure with a false discovery rate of 5% is used to identify hospitals, hospital trusts and regional health authorities with significantly higher/lower survival than the reference. In addition, estimated risk-adjusted survival probabilities are published per hospital, hospital trust and regional health authority. The variation in risk-adjusted survival probabilities across hospitals for AMI shows a decreasing trend over time: estimated survival probabilities for AMI in 2011 varied from 80.6% (in the hospital with lowest estimated survival) to 91.7% (in the hospital with highest estimated survival), whereas it ranged from 83.8% to 91.2% in 2013.


CONCLUSIONS
Since 2011, several hospitals and hospital trusts have initiated quality improvement projects, and some of the hospitals have improved the survival over these years. Public reporting of survival/mortality indicators are increasingly being used as quality measures of health care systems. Openness regarding the methods used to calculate the indicators are important, as it provides the opportunity of critically reviewing and discussing the methods in the literature. In this way, the methods employed for establishing the indicators may be improved.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sahar Hassani"", ids = ""14164466""); list(name = ""Anja Schou Lindman"", ids = ""5152635""); list(name = ""Doris Tove Kristoffersen"", ids = ""6061196""); list(name = ""Oliver TomiÄ‡"", ids = ""3565419""); list(name = ""Jon Helgeland"", ids = ""5687887"")",29f8895503172c5da035b770c77456b801d8a625; 46e2b686fe7894c9ff1b3da6ca92ee4f9b9dce70; 9d834d97a1e91b11e05364b0bf18a2041eedc4d0; 1012c40d09d9b4974cf5e6d6a420b30fb12a1420; 860aca1db7fb15263ebfa209fd860f9f4d09337b; ab4d526dba46b1a269f096f63a5db1f963549f7b; 322a53e656f9e9e1c5d74336d12f44eb3feca5e2; 8f76415db74d2172bc118b0e524fef5472ad03c0; 54d04f1bdf038bcaa38088584909e71a20ba3346; 9637bd34f1500458d3a83d30e684b9495bb90113; 3fcfde52c2b159973a3acbc101005c047075bdc4; dd98176b07930bcec0a6652511c6e81502c466bc; 814db01f26fb867795e29d6d3776775c1c3bfd0f; 883d80b08db7012fc86023eb9cc81a93017dfc63; c8973c4420ee2567cb52f03f99eb514daa1965d7,90eff97781c6ca9a6f4179e06e5f2ed211a05058; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 620480eb3cfcace42ae870f4b98f7af06f0ed818; 787c917d663c5dd8fad53fa3b18889d8e44cf695; d33c7c54a62c6dbee4410b27042f6a7a4a32efcb; 1fe31d951f14044a3793e1e0558d9873dac8cd5e; f1292972fdf2fb6b508df27d11902e1f9dd497df; ec0a7c8341992c64cb519f2fb172c00fc6b74023; e74931b35f0e17c09f1eb662b999bf087026436c; 8e32cd4f1e074b062b37708b37a96c34163d0d5b; d78ec59d6e5df8bc8285999916ff2932e92f6690; b414def5064e6853a7eb9264d6a3edd2e10f3fa0; d5c072a27b5cd2ed2f6c965ce14bd98efff02fc0; 7a2e13a4c64a51e791b6103d2c5165cef701d863; 6aaa239aaabce513e6d395337525e4b013552583; 81663f1e0685cd33fe2afd1ab587efada253c6db; ef4d2dd278d417432f640510cf8f852405a5e0eb; 4f5c1e0b69069a6210730a39fdf067b17c56de51; 338673d26ef67fd697c37d16704edcba505935a6; 5d4e053f60c45055b94fdcc7851ee973d7c24772; 2dca8394dc0dbe83529d86652130a2f01a60857b; adfcf516121e9775e38eb4e523708638b36d6dc3,PLoS ONE,10,

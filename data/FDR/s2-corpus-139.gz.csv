39d8a0e18c1b681a36b26237b73f49adc8ad6710,Dimensionality and the statistical power of multivariate genome-wide association studies,"Mutations virtually always have pleiotropic effects, yet most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) analyze effects one trait at a time. In order to investigate the performance of a multivariate approach to GWAS, we simulated scenarios where variation in a d-dimensional phenotype space was caused by a known subset of SNPs. Multivariate analyses of variance were then carried out on k traits, where k could be less than, greater than or equal to d. Our results show that power is maximized and false discovery rate (FDR) minimized when the number of traits analyzed, k, matches the true dimensionality of the phenotype being analyzed, d. When true dimensionality is high, the power of a single univariate analysis can be an order of magnitude less than the k=d case, even when the single trait with the largest genetic variance is chosen for analysis. When traits are added to a study in order of their independent genetic variation, the gains in power from increasing k up to d are much larger than the loss in power when k exceeds d. Simulations that explicitly model linkage disequilibrium (LD) indicate that when SNPs in disequilibrium are subjected to multivariate analysis, the magnitude of the apparent effect induced onto null SNPs by SNPs carrying a true effect weakens as k approaches d, such that the rank of P-values among a set of correlated SNPs becomes an increasingly reliable predictor of true positives. Multivariate GWAS outperform univariate ones under a wide range of conditions, and should become the standard in studies of the inheritance of complex phenotypes.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Eladio J.

c56fd9ad3895b7b1b9e9a7f6f17d63d2214a5ee6,Statistical Analysis of High-Dimensional Gene Expression Data,"The use of diagnostic rules based on microarray gene expression data has received wide attention in bioinformatics research. In order to form diagnostic rules, statistical techniques are needed to form classifiers with estimates for their associated error rates, and to correct for any selection biases in the estimates. There are also the associated problems of identifying the genes most useful in making these predictions. Traditional statistical techniques require the number of samples to be much larger than the number of features. Gene expression datasets usually have a small number of samples, but a large number of features. In this thesis, some new techniques are developed, and traditional techniques are used innovatively after appropriate modification to analyse gene expression data. Classification: We first consider classifying tissue samples based on the gene expression data. We employ an external cross-validation with recursive feature elimination to provide classification error rates for tissue samples with different numbers of genes. The techniques are implemented as an R package BCC (Bias-Corrected Classification), and are applied to a number of real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that the error rates vary with different numbers of genes. For each dataset, there is usually an optimal number of genes that returns the lowest cross-validation error rate. Detecting Differentially Expressed Genes: We then consider the detection of genes that are differentially expressed in a given number of classes. As this problem concerns the selection of significant genes from a large pool of candidate genes, it needs to be carried out within the framework of multiple hypothesis testing. The focus is on the use of mixture models to handle the multiplicity issue. The mixture model approach provides a framework for the estimation of the prior probability that a gene is not differentially expressed. It estimates various error rates, including the FDR (False Discovery Rate) and the FNR (False Negative Rate). We also develop a method for selecting biomarker genes for classification, based on their repeatability among the highly differentially expressed genes in cross-validation trials. The latter method incorporates both gene selection and classification. Selection Bias: When forming a prediction rule on the basis of a small number of classified tissue samples, some form of feature (gene) selection is usually adopted. This is a necessary step if the number of features is high. As the subset of genes used in the final form of the rule has not been randomly selected but rather chosen according to some criteria designed to reflect the predictive power of the rule, there will be a selection bias inherent in estimates of the error rates of the rule if care is not taken. Various situations are presented where selection biases arise in the formation of a prediction rule and where there is a consequent need for the correction of the biases. Three types of selection biases are analysed: selection bias from not using external cross-validation, selection bias of not working with the full set of genes, and the selection bias from optimizing the classification error rate over a number of subsets obtained according to a selection method. Here we mostly employ the support vector machine with recursive feature elimination. This thesis includes a description of cross-validation schemes that are able to correct for these selection biases. Furthermore, we examine the bias incurred when using the predicted rather than the true outcomes to define the class labels in forming and evaluating the performance of the discriminant rule. Case Study: We present a case study using the breast cancer datasets. In the study, we compare the 70 highly differentially expressed genes proposed by van 't Veer and colleagues, against the set of the genes selected using our repeatability method. The results demonstrate that there is more than one set of biomarker genes. We also examine the selection biases that may exist when analysing this dataset. The selection biases are demonstrated to be substantial.",2009,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Justin Zhu"", ids = ""48566512"")",,,,,

These address the special structure of clinical research, where the comparisons of treatments involve both primary and secondary endpoints, by assigning weights that reflect the relative importance of the endpoints in the error being controlled. In the hierarchical method, the primary endpoints and a properly weighted intersection hypothesis that represents all secondary endpoints are tested. Should the intersection hypothesis be among the rejected, individual secondary endpoints are tested. We identify configurations where each of the two procedures has the advantage. Both offer higher power than competing hierarchical (gatekeeper) familywise errorâ€rate controlling procedures being used for drug approval. By their design, the advantage of the proposed methods is the increased power to discover effects on secondary endpoints, without giving up the rigor of addressing their multiplicity.",2017,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yoav Benjamini"", ids = ""1808156""); list(name = ""Rami Cohen"", ids = ""2221482"")",d94ff71eb2bf0fa7339171882f40db2e50d7ad45; 3754a4c95911d47dc71df8411e108b5228d5eb54; e54ffbb9371e561e1e892bd3f4fa50871ebd8d96; 918788b31851867a52d27e03bb3acc8f077f7708; f71a878dc681935cc072e17fd8d7dfc22142c521; 007d89474f536e2996e4cd4d4c624ab30c3f40dd; b547c4e3aaba790e9fcbd86b8a33f435b7603ade; 3a59750ebf546d9a769b90dc0119f2cdfa15de69; dfd0486d742dfc78b8daf452607b99f598eb0dc9; 74b53a200b82590bda66b7829d115ed63921aa88; 385df23abf50b1d7ee3b53fe1f051b4261fe03e6; 1cc2dfaff595fad1d53f8aa6542707cc75ec29c2; f0d699fc15bd09a15c3620b26b21c3856d482e20; ef0a651732ba60cc8d3d53e460199bb85c990f03; d479a0866922c90bad725e9fa54281d2bb4c1d7a; b97c0fdfbdb992cf8603031812fc177d870fb939; 8841681ebacf12fad116ce57f68fb7838007e3f6; 944929c3ee7549d2fd3b4c0bc397392ee2d6b245; 6ae75c0506a0d7b61c850f581920e2144beb1ee1,5800894aa631837c684614c2e108da79f73af2a2; e78994431e72d3d1d64723fd05dcb2524cb8f873; 45a491b43b7318df857dd0ca0b749a7815eedcf7; 48293c2bb4c1e1f6536d774b24a0ce6ed8815ccc; 179d7b170048360a00877b55f9b8073ae1143009; c0d361344070a3d739f8d67e418f34805cd557b7; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; 220d19025c70489a87b139e7fa368dab588cb490; 88a5cd8f6a27dc12d8c65ceaa3007452c493eaac; 8db8646c94852e7b36cb9610fb998faab3eee8bb; 96ef799148b63e2f4399cb454b1dd1b0c6836c3d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; bcd2a1e2a53751ab3f3d312f0ec6da41a0628451,"Biostatistics (Oxford, England)",18,91 - 104
77019e3c23afa1393160dd9d9fa7c4342f784b05,Statistical Genetics: False discovery or missed discovery?,"T he Human Genome Project ushered the era of big science into human genetics. For some time, scientists have scanned the genome for evidence of linkage between widely spaced markers and disease phenotypes, but now tens of thousands of loci are being queried for their association with phenotypes related to complex disease, and thousands of genes are evaluated for differential expressions in different tissues or types of tumors. In the genomics arena, hypothesis tests to identify widespread genomic features are commonplace. In a recent article in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, Storey and Tibshirani (2003) point to a unifying principle in many of these investigations,namely a large number of features are tested, often independently, against a simple null hypothesis. When confronted with such a vast number of hypothesis tests and the potential for numerous false positives, the traditional statistical approach is to impose a penalty to account for multiple testing, such as the Bonferroni correction. As Storey and Tibshirani point out, that penalty can be far too severe, especially so when it is likely that many of the alternatives are true. In response to the new scientific environment, a competing approach to multiple testing has come to light that is based on controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). As noted by Storey and Tibshirani, this approach is appropriate when the goal of the experiment is â€˜to identify as many significant features in the genome as possible, while incurring a relatively low proportion of false positivesâ€™. The FDR approach is due to Benjamini and Hochberg (1995, 2000). Hypothesis testing is concerned with deciding between two hypotheses: a null hypothesis (the status quo) and the alternative hypothesis. The data analyst evaluates a test statistic T and then finds the P-value, the probability of getting a test statistic as or more extreme than T under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Small P-values are taken as evidence that the null hypothesis is false. When testing multiple hypotheses, the situation is much more complicated. There are several ways to measure the error rate (Table 1). Let m be the number of tests, F be the number of false positives, T be the number of true positives, and S1â„4 FÃ¾T be the total number of discoveries, or rejected null hypotheses. The common error measures are PCER 1â„4 EÃ°FÃž=m per comparison error rate FWER 1â„4 PÃ°FX1Ãž family wise error rate FDR 1â„4 EÃ°F=SÃž false discovery rate",2003,Biology,"list(name = ""Bernie Devlin"", ids = ""1853262""); list(name = ""Kathryn Roeder"", ids = ""144750484""); list(name = ""Larry A.

bd9149c7ea17d0d077858b4ed9b5a235016587d9,A robust permutation test for quantitative SILAC proteomics experiments,"Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC) along with other relative quantitation methods in proteomics have become important tools in the analysis of cellular and subcelluar functions. Although numerous experimental applications of SILAC have been developed, there is no consensus on the use of statistical procedures to analyze the resulting experimental data. SILAC experiments output relative abundance ratios for proteins to quantify dierences in cell populations. These ratios have traditionally been analyzed with fold-change methods and hypothesis testing procedures under Gaussian distribution assumptions. We find that the normality assumption is invalid and can lead to inaccurate quantitation of the significance of differences between cell populations. As a solution, a permutation based hypothesis test as an alternative for assessing significance is introduced. We develop distribution-free permutation testing methods for assessing SILAC experiments. These tests generate p-values which can be easily interpreted and if necessary, the false discovery rate of these p-values can be easily controlled. To compare the permutation test against competing methodology, we used a set of simulations based upon a theoretical model of SILAC ratio data. Through the simulation studies, we find that the permutation test is generally superior to the competing hypothesis tests across the range of simulation scenarios. We also find that the permutation test is typically more powerful and accurate than the competing methods at the five percent level of signicance and averaged over the spectrum of signicance levels. Because of the broad superiority of the permutation test and the ease of implementation, we propose the use of the permutation test as a standard measure of protein signicance in SILAC experiments.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Hien D.

5daa50bf64554a4e61eb9a3d9cfd356529d80e2e,Model-Free Inference for ChIP-Seq Data,"Due to its higher resolution mapping and stronger ChIP enrichment signals, ChIP-seq tends to replace ChIP-chip technology in studying genome-wide protein-DNA interactions, while the massive digital ChIP-seq data present new challenges to statisticians. To date, most methods proposed in the literature for ChIP-seq data analysis are model based, however, finding a single model workable for all datasets is impossible, given the complexity of biological systems and variations generated in the sequencing process. In this paper, we present a model-free approach, the so-called MICS (Model-free Inference for ChIP-Seq), for ChIP-seq data analysis. MICS has a few advantages over the existing methods: Firstly, MICS avoids assumptions for the data distribution, and thus it maintains high power even when model assumptions for the data are violated. Secondly, MICS employs a simulation-based method in estimating the false discovery rate. Since the simulation-based method works independently of ChIP samples, MICS can perform robustly to variety of ChIP samples; it can produce accurate identification of peak regions, even for those where the enrichment is weak. Thirdly, MICS is very efficient in computation, which takes only a few seconds on a personal computer for a reasonably large dataset. In this paper, we also present a simple semi-empirical method for simulating ChIP-seq data, which allows a better assessment of performance of different approaches for ChIP-seq data analysis. MICS is compared with several existing methods, including MACS, CCAT, PICS, BayesPeak and QuEST, based on real and simulated datasets. The numerical results indicate that MICS can outperform others.

Given the impact that conclusions derived from such analyses may have, we have evaluated the robustness of clustering individuals based on WGS data to three key factors: (1) next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform (HiSeq, MiSeq, IonTorrent, 454, and SOLiD), (2) algorithms used to construct a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) matrix (reference-based and reference-free), and (3) phylogenetic inference method (FastTreeMP, GARLI, and RAxML). We carried out these analyses on 194 whole genome sequences representing 107 unique Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ser. Montevideo strains. Reference-based approaches for identifying SNPs produced trees that were significantly more similar to one another than those produced under the reference-free approach. Topologies inferred using a core matrix (i.e., no missing data) were significantly more discordant than those inferred using a non-core matrix that allows for some missing data. However, allowing for too much missing data likely results in a high false discovery rate of SNPs. When analyzing the same SNP matrix, we observed that the more thorough inference methods implemented in GARLI and RAxML produced more similar topologies than FastTreeMP. Our results also confirm that reproducibility varies among NGS platforms where the MiSeq had the lowest number of pairwise differences among replicate runs. Our investigation into the robustness of clustering patterns illustrates the importance of carefully considering how data from different platforms are combined and analyzed. We found clear differences in the topologies inferred, and certain methods performed significantly better than others for discriminating between the highly clonal organisms investigated here.

These criteria are false discovery rate (FDR), variance-normalized differential expression levels (paired statistics), and minimum acceptable difference (MAD). The methodology also provides a set of simultaneous FDR confidence intervals on the true expression differences. The analysis can be implemented as a two-stage algorithm in which there is an initial screen that controls only FDR, which is then followed by a second screen which controls both FDR and MAD. It can also be implemented by computing and thresholding the set of FDR values for each gene that satisfies the MAD criterion. We illustrate the procedure to identify differentially expressed genes from a wild type versus knockout comparison of microarray data.",2004,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Alfred O.

Combinatorial Library Functional Screening","DNA-encoded synthesis is rekindling interest in combinatorial compound libraries for drug discovery and in technology for automated and quantitative library screening. Here, we disclose a microfluidic circuit that enables functional screens of DNA-encoded compound beads. The device carries out library bead distribution into picoliter-scale assay reagent droplets, photochemical cleavage of compound from the bead, assay incubation, laser-induced fluorescence-based assay detection, and fluorescence-activated droplet sorting to isolate hits. DNA-encoded compound beads (10-Î¼m diameter) displaying a photocleavable positive control inhibitor pepstatin A were mixed (1920 beads, 729 encoding sequences) with negative control beads (58â€¯000 beads, 1728 encoding sequences) and screened for cathepsin D inhibition using a biochemical enzyme activity assay. The circuit sorted 1518 hit droplets for collection following 18 min incubation over a 240 min analysis. Visual inspection of a subset of droplets (1188 droplets) yielded a 24% false discovery rate (1166 pepstatin A beads; 366 negative control beads). Using template barcoding strategies, it was possible to count hit collection beads (1863) using next-generation sequencing data. Bead-specific barcodes enabled replicate counting, and the false discovery rate was reduced to 2.6% by only considering hit-encoding sequences that were observed on >2 beads.

ee735881ea1ba85eda733d0f4b4b0f25eaa37877,Incorporation of Sparsity Information in Large-scale Multiple Two-sample t Tests,"Large-scale multiple two-sample Studentâ€™s t testing problems often arise from the statistical analysis of scientic data. To detect components with dierent values between two mean vectors, a well-known procedure is to apply the Benjamini and Hochberg (B-H) method and two-sample Studentâ€™s t statistics to control the false discovery rate (FDR). In many applications, mean vectors are expected to be sparse or asymptotically sparse. When dealing with such type of data, can we gain more power than the standard procedure such as the B-H method with Studentâ€™s t statistics while keeping the FDR under control? The answer is positive. By exploiting the possible sparsity information in mean vectors, we present an uncorrelated screening-based (US) FDR control procedure, which is shown to be more powerful than the B-H method. The US testing procedure depends on a novel construction of screening statistics, which are asymptotically uncorrelated with two-sample Studentâ€™s t statistics. The US testing procedure is dierent",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Weidong Liu"", ids = ""48152451"")",be3681e06bb3b0635b9a3775935dd15c0151c823; 2e5258900ba2f9134dcd5bee4a1f88091a972234; ee735881ea1ba85eda733d0f4b4b0f25eaa37877; 6de25f28f84c031d066466e04576b7038b85a403,8d4a82f8262abfb55754990665146f8bca94d8d6; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; d60607f4c936a83d3823d1dd3b575370ff7fbe3c; 2888f87e01c7adfd95f02c52339a7db8ad329677; 30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98; 632d948109728efbc57e45c6036c458644de26d3; aab93c206a61faafa791614f417041a9697cbc03; ef1bf316ce572888268aba556d8534768e8c816a; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; f35dfefdd5c44c5e717e17bb72c273b22b0878f1; a759777f7c4d59bd43f870d98f618ac09ad66fa3; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; 5e147ca57ea8ba09c571abc2fb75a02724c1b611; 76f667df49db0e5a3a2f4fdd45995a120d3a6c32; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 6416371037e6d6e602931e9674285f06ca2bb424; ee735881ea1ba85eda733d0f4b4b0f25eaa37877; e2bff19225be31650c4f54c17d36c6317237dd2a; b2b16a9bf487b00f80801ff57c7cbb96503a9e81; 14b741a091d7eae2a7b1c27281a9e4417a587f08,arXiv: Methodology,,

This work focused on ischemic stroke (IS) and aimed to identify novel lncRNA biomarkers and construct lncRNA-related networks in IS. Methods: Differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified using Arraystar Human LncRNA Microarray v4.0, and validated with qRT-PCR. A lncRNAâ€“mRNA co-expression network and a lncRNAâ€“miRNAâ€“mRNA regulatory network were constructed. Functional and pathway analyses were then performed. Results: In total, 560 up-regulated and 690 down-regulated differentially expressed lncRNAs were found (P < 0.05, false discovery rate < 0.05, absolute fold change â‰¥ 2). qRT-PCR results confirmed that lncRNA-ENST00000568297, lncRNA-ENST00000568243, and lncRNA-NR_046084 exhibited significant differential expression between IS and controls (all P < 0.05). Areas under the curves (AUCs) for these lncRNAs were 0.733, 0.743, and 0.690, respectively, and the combined AUC was 0.843. A codingâ€“noncoding co-expression (CNC) network was constructed based on Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient. A specific lncRNAâ€“miRNAâ€“mRNA regulatory network of ENST00000568297, ENST00000568243, and NR_046084 was also constructed. Functional annotation of the up- and down-regulated mRNAs was performed. Pathway analysis enriched IS-related pathways with mRNAs in the lncRNAâ€“miRNAâ€“mRNA regulatory network.

7c9f04ba96b60c5b92762b0d3ee3f8a0cba464e0,CAR T Cell Cytotoxicity Is Dependent on Death Receptor-Driven Apoptosis,"Background: T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors targeting the B-cell antigen CD19 (CART19) have demonstrated impressive results in the treatment of lymphoid cancers. Despite these promising outcomes, a significant subset of patients relapse after initial response. To investigate the molecular pathways that drive relapse, we performed an unbiased, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-wide knockout screen in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line Nalm6, and found that loss of CD19 was the primary driver of relapse after initial response. This finding is consistent with clinical observations that antigen loss is a primary driver of late disease recurrence, however it fails to address the molecular etiology of intrinsic resistance, which affects ~50% of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and ~20% of patients with ALL, or of late antigen-independent relapse, which accounts for ~40% of relapses in ALL. Identification of the mechanisms regulating CART19 susceptibility is an essential first step in overcoming resistance to this powerful therapy. We hypothesized that genetic alteration in ALL cells were responsible for mediating intrinsic, CD19-independent resistance. To investigate this, we conducted a genome-wide loss of function screen in a model designed to evaluate intrinsic resistance to CART19. Methods: Using a lentiviral guide RNA (gRNA) library containing four distinct gRNAs targeting each human gene (~80,000 gRNAs total), we enabled genome-wide knockout in Nalm6, whereby each target cell lost function of only one gene. This gene-modified cell pool was then exposed to either CART19 or control T cells at a low effector:target ratio (0.25:1) to model the expected in vivo E:T ratio. At 24h, surviving Nalm6 cells were collected and gRNA from these cells underwent next-generation sequencing. Sequenced samples were processed using three distinct genome-scale knockout screen algorithms (MAGeCK, permutation-based non-parametric analysis and ScreenBeam). This pipeline allowed identification of (i) significantly enriched gRNA, postulated to mediate loss of gene function that confers resistance to CART19, and (ii) significantly depleted guides, postulated to mediate loss of gene function that confers sensitivity to CART19. The role of identified genes was then validated in in vitro and in vivo studies. Results: Analysis of gRNA sequencing data from our screen (Figure 1) revealed that the three genes whose loss of function most significantly promoted resistance to CART19 were BID, FADD and CASP8, all of which are key regulators of death receptor-driven apoptosis. TNFRSF10B, encoding the death receptor TRAIL-R2, was also significantly enriched. Interestingly, amongst the 10 genes whose loss most significantly sensitized to CART19 were TRAF2, BIRC2 and CFLAR, all negative regulators of death receptor activity. Pathway analysis of the top 50 genes (25 enriched, 25 depleted) demonstrated significant enrichment in the death receptor pathway, with a false discovery rate of 3.79x10-7. We proceeded to functionally validate the role of BID and FADD in mediating resistance to CART19 by deleting these genes in Nalm6 using de novo designed gRNAs. Strikingly, BIDKO and FADDKO cells were highly resistant to CART19 cytotoxicity in vitro as compared to wild-type Nalm6. Resistance was evident as early as 6 hours after co-culture and was maintained for at least 7 days. Observed resistance to CART19 directly correlated to fraction of KO cells present, suggesting that gene loss was mechanistically responsible for failed CART19 cytotoxicity. We further evaluated the impact of BID or FADD loss on anti-leukemic activity of CART19 in our Nalm6 xenograft model. We observed that BIDKO or FADDKO significantly impaired the anti-leukemic activity of CART19 in vivo. Conclusions: CART19 can cure select patients with B-cell cancers, while others experience transient or no clinical benefit. Using a genome-wide loss of function screen, we identified that death receptor-associated proteins are centrally involved in regulating CART19 cytotoxicity, and that loss of these molecules leads to intrinsic resistance to CART19. These findings are, to our knowledge, the first to characterize the role of death receptors as critical regulators of CART19 cytotoxicity, and suggest that tumor cell modulation of death receptor signaling may drive both inherent resistance and antigen-independent relapse.

This quantity is typically estimated based on p-values or test statistics. In some scenarios, there is additional information available that may be used to more accurately estimate the false discovery rate. We develop a new framework for formulating and estimating false discovery rates and q-values when an additional piece of information, which we call an â€œinformative variableâ€, is available. For a given test, the informative variable provides information about the prior probability a null hypothesis is true or the power of that particular test. The false discovery rate is then treated as a function of this informative variable. We consider two applications in genomics. Our first is a genetics of gene expression (eQTL) experiment in yeast where every genetic marker and gene expression trait pair are tested for associations. The informative variable in this case is the distance between each genetic marker and gene. Our second application is to detect differentially expressed genes in an RNA-seq study carried out in mice. The informative variable in this study is the per-gene read depth. The framework we develop is quite general, and it should be useful in a broad range of scientific applications.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Xiongzhi Chen"", ids = ""40961028""); list(name = ""David G.

8258f2b4577c68ee6a7d903384bfe6442e082b4b,Identification of Gene Loci That Overlap Between Schizophrenia and Educational Attainment,"There is evidence for genetic overlap between cognitive abilities and schizophrenia (SCZ), and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) demonstrate that both SCZ and general cognitive abilities have a strong polygenic component with many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) each with a small effect. Here we investigated the shared genetic architecture between SCZ and educational attainment, which is regarded as a ""proxy phenotype"" for cognitive abilities, but may also reflect other traits. We applied a conditional false discovery rate (condFDR) method to GWAS of SCZ (n = 82 315), college completion (""College,"" n = 95 427), and years of education (""EduYears,"" n = 101 069). Variants associated with College or EduYears showed enrichment of association with SCZ, demonstrating polygenic overlap. This was confirmed by an increased replication rate in SCZ. By applying a condFDR threshold <0.01, we identified 18 genomic loci associated with SCZ after conditioning on College and 15 loci associated with SCZ after conditioning on EduYears. Ten of these loci overlapped. Using conjunctional FDR, we identified 10 loci shared between SCZ and College, and 29 loci shared between SCZ and EduYears. The majority of these loci had effects in opposite directions. Our results provide evidence for polygenic overlap between SCZ and educational attainment, and identify novel pleiotropic loci. Other studies have reported genetic overlap between SCZ and cognition, or SCZ and educational attainment, with negative correlation. Importantly, our methods enable identification of bi-directional effects, which highlight the complex relationship between SCZ and educational attainment, and support polygenic mechanisms underlying both cognitive dysfunction and creativity in SCZ.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Stephanie Le Hellard"", ids = ""4904017""); list(name = ""Yunpeng Wang"", ids = ""40566190""); list(name = ""Aree Witoelar"", ids = ""2222549""); list(name = ""Verena Zuber"", ids = ""2882566""); list(name = ""Francesco Bettella"", ids = ""2792807""); list(name = ""Kenneth Hugdahl"", ids = ""2976640""); list(name = ""Thomas Espeseth"", ids = ""2874733""); list(name = ""Vidar M.

f0bcde37e90ed0f471f5180cb5b037df64e0a22b,Segmentation of malaria parasite candidates from thick blood smear microphotographs image using active contour without edge,"Malaria is a serious health problem in Indonesia caused by malaria parasites. Early detection of Malaria is an important step to an effective treatment. Malaria parasite identification should be carried out based on observation on at least 100 fields view strong magnification of thick blood smears. Malaria parasite detection process is usually carried out with a microscope observation. But it consumes too much time and the number experts are limited. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a computer aided diagnosis system to automatically detecting malaria parasites. Parasite image segmentation is an important step in the detection process. But segmentation of malaria parasite that consists of a nucleus and cytoplasm in a thick blood smear is not easy because the boundary between object and background is not clear and has a low contrast. This study proposed a solution to the problem of segmentation of malaria candidate parasite candidates from thick blood smears. The proposed method focused on image enhancement and segmentation steps. Image enhancement consists of lowpass filtering to reduce noise and contrast stretching to increase contrast. Segmentation is used to detect object using active contour without edge, then erosion, dilation, masking, contrast stretching, and thresholding. The result showed that the proposed method is capable to segment malaria parasite candidates from thick blood smear with 97.57% accuracy, 12.04% (283 pixels) false negative rate (FNR), and 6.87% (202 pixels) false discovery rate (FDR), from 19600 pixels total in each image.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Sekar Rini Abidin"", ids = ""30846963""); list(name = ""Umi Daris Salamah"", ids = ""89092725""); list(name = ""Anto Satriyo Nugroho"", ids = ""2862751"")",ec723b4df8bec7e5cbdf555563b829fa3f023e07; 3aaad349f401a4047ff55d5861bcd07f2ede995e; fc64607fb0dfb7a4dc3c1fe6f5c63e68d7786a20,324d8caec63a6faf2ced3a70bd5e1a7b0f49146f; 711b5329524e1df0d3546b2be9fb1aeabe91a0f2; 7d747dec88d05c0d04d14f9073a9a1017c421869; d8c86bd895d8271f9618966b7e95643b793980ba; f5e7d8221ec2da20a22e1beba4fe164f9c8978f1; 9be1e4132a3ab06da6188527f9da701d91d14bd5; 78812ed19b13769c0239d62fa34c8680015c55e2,2016 1st International Conference on Biomedical Engineering (IBIOMED),,1-6
c174f3cd783f6d7c60f45465a11531dad3ec0ceb,A comparison of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with some Bayesian rules for multiple testing,"In the spirit of modeling inference for microarrays as multiple testing for sparse mixtures, we present a similar approach to a simplified version of quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Unlike in case of microarrays, where the number of tests usually reaches tens of thousands, the number of tests performed in scans for QTL usually does not exceed several hundreds. However, in typical cases, the sparsity $p$ of significant alternatives for QTL mapping is in the same range as for microarrays. For methodological interest, as well as some related applications, we also consider non-sparse mixtures. Using simulations as well as theoretical observations we study false discovery rate (FDR), power and misclassification probability for the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure and its modifications, as well as for various parametric and nonparametric Bayes and Parametric Empirical Bayes procedures. Our results confirm the observation of Genovese and Wasserman (2002) that for small p the misclassification error of BH is close to optimal in the sense of attaining the Bayes oracle. This property is shared by some of the considered Bayes testing rules, which in general perform better than BH for large or moderate $p$'s.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""M. L.

To determine molecular mechanisms of this response, we employed tandem mass tag (TMT) quantitative global proteomics approach on skin tumors from mice exposed to 180 mJ/cm2 UVB twice per week and fed control or 5% GP diet. We found 2,629 proteins modulated by GP feeding, with 34 identified using stringent cutoffs (false discovery rate (FDR) q-value â‰¤0.1, fold change â‰¥1.2, p-value â‰¤0.05, â‰¥3 unique peptides). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis helped identify seven proteins involved in protein ubiquitination, including the deubiquitinase UCHL5 and 6 subunits of the 20S proteasome (PSMA1,3,4,6 and PSMB4,7). A second data set without the FDR q-value identified 239 modulated proteins, seven of which are involved in protein ubiquitination. Further, 14 proteins involved in acute phase response signaling were modulated >1.5-fold, including acute phase proteins APCS, FGA, FGB, HP, HPX, and RBP1. Evaluation of upstream regulators found inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NF-ÎºB p65, and an increase in IÎºBÎ± in GP-treated tumors. Overall, our data suggested that GP consumption may mitigate tumorigenesis by enhancing protein ubiquitination and degradation caused by oxidative stress, and manipulates an otherwise tumor-promoting anti-inflammatory environment.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Charlotte A.

f3fb5830215b5e5d7bedab526918eef53eae6f4d,Cardiac status of perinatally HIV-infected children: assessing combination antiretroviral regimens in observational studies,"Objective: To evaluate potential adverse associations of individual antiretroviral medications used in combination antiretroviral therapy regimens on cardiac structure and function in youth with perinatally-acquired HIV infection (PHIV). Design: PHIV youth (Nâ€Š=â€Š325) enrolled in a prospective multisite cohort study had a single echocardiogram at age 7â€“16 years to evaluate cardiac function and structure. Methods: We applied several statistical approaches to evaluate associations between use of 18 individual antiretroviral medications with Z-scores for 11 measures of left ventricular function and structure. These included simultaneously evaluating all antiretroviral medications in adjusted linear regression models controlling for the false discovery rate (FDR), applying hierarchical models to estimate individual antiretroviral medication effects as deviations from drug class means, and evaluating latent measures of cardiac function and structure underlying multiple echocardiographic parameters. Results: Youth taking combination regimens with a protease inhibitor (69%) had significantly better cardiac function than those on other regimens. After FDR control and adjustment for other antiretroviral medications, no individual antiretroviral medication was significantly associated with any measure of left ventricular function, but zidovudine was associated with higher adjusted mean Z-scores for one measure of left ventricular structure (end-systolic wall stress). Factor analysis identified three latent factors: heart function, heart size, and heart wall stress.

b7730d8ef6639c16358da0611279060b85ac237c,Effects of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors on Interregional Relation of Serotonin Transporter Availability in Major Depression,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) modulate serotonergic neurotransmission by blocking reuptake of serotonin from the extracellular space. Up to now, it remains unclear how SSRIs achieve their antidepressant effect. However, task-based and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, have demonstrated connectivity changes between brain regions. Here, we use positron emission tomography (PET) to quantify SSRI's main target, the serotonin transporter (SERT), and assess treatment-induced molecular changes in the interregional relation of SERT binding potential (BPND). Nineteen out-patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 19 healthy controls (HC) were included in this study. Patients underwent three PET measurements with the radioligand [11C]DASB: (1) at baseline, (2) after a first SSRI dose; and (3) following at least 3 weeks of daily intake. Controls were measured once with PET. Correlation analyses were restricted to brain regions repeatedly implicated in MDD pathophysiology. After 3 weeks of daily SSRI administration a significant increase in SERT BPND correlations of anterior cingulate cortex and insula with the amygdala, midbrain, hippocampus, pallidum and putamen (p < 0.05; false discovery rate, FDR corrected) was revealed. No significant differences were found when comparing MDD patients and HC at baseline. These findings are in line with the clinical observation that treatment response to SSRIs is often achieved only after a latency of several weeks. The elevated associations in interregional SERT associations may be more closely connected to clinical outcomes than regional SERT occupancy measures and could reflect a change in the regional interaction of serotonergic neurotransmission during antidepressant treatment.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gregory Miles James"", ids = ""36010735""); list(name = ""Pia Baldinger-Melich"", ids = ""1403679102""); list(name = ""Cecile Philippe"", ids = ""46292492""); list(name = ""Georg S.

6b739c6e0680f42a8bb4050638d3319eecf8c4d9,Comparisons of estimators of the number of true null hypotheses and adaptive FDR procedures in multiplicity testing,"Many exploratory studies such as microarray experiments require the simultaneous comparison of hundreds or thousands of genes. It is common to see that most genes in many microarray experiments are not expected to be differentially expressed. Under such a setting, a procedure that is designed to control the false discovery rate (FDR) is aimed at identifying as many potential differentially expressed genes as possible. The usual FDR controlling procedure is constructed based on the number of hypotheses. However, it can become very conservative when some of the alternative hypotheses are expected to be true. The power of a controlling procedure can be improved if the number of true null hypotheses (m 0) instead of the number of hypotheses is incorporated in the procedure [Y. Benjamini and Y. Hochberg, On the adaptive control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing with independent statistics, J. Edu. Behav. Statist. 25(2000), pp. 60â€“83]. Nevertheless, m 0 is unknown, and has to be estimated. The objective of this article is to evaluate some existing estimators of m 0 and discuss the feasibility of these estimators in incorporating into FDR controlling procedures under various experimental settings. The results of simulations can help the investigator to choose an appropriate procedure to meet the requirement of the study.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yi-Ting Hwang"", ids = ""2223332"")",9323cde67b00cb726f838385ec305feba761d813; 30164f63203a0805716c8fc70f65a24cbd32532e; b84d708c1c7c7275dddff49835977ad1faf1bd44; 5d33df966768d1c3a54093b2a005d7e84eb2ae1c,b5e313d1f9f9eb9462c34a8f4cf87953beb92eee; 203b6a2b510075b63a79570887c681fb9e4b8208; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 6946b51f61c89d04885392be786a9606ca7be330; 41a0fd9fdfd82dbb1c3e07cf1c80cb57b3ca776f; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; 514de7fd03e14cf5b557b859fddaab2277e45850; abb79b031800acb821b037c98f37ac86d78538d3; 9a65e9f6a96b5dca52edde1eb31dc01ed6c3214c; 604ee9ce5a7daa35020171b80b23f82eb7b3378a; 43db684dc246d0f28a36b7cec3b84f1fe2cef0b4; 5796c81a64d3ffec0cf7d9d79b092ea070db47f0; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; dfc1446c5d5034bdb9294a34c42a8f360dd93207,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation,81,207 - 220
533df3bd71aa4e346d2f694733f3a30dd829be78,Identification of Serum MicroRNAs as Novel Biomarkers in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Using Feature Selection Algorithms,"Introduction: Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are promising molecular biomarkers for the early detection of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We investigated the serum miRNA expression profiles from microarray-based technologies and evaluated the diagnostic value of serum miRNAs as potential biomarkers for ESCC by using feature selection algorithms. Methods: Serum miRNA expression profiles were obtained from 52 ESCC patients and 52 age- and sex-matched controls via performing a high-throughput microarray assay. Five representative feature selection algorithms including the false discovery rate procedure, family-wise error rate procedure, Lasso logistic regression, hybrid huberized support vector machine (SVM), and SVM using the squared-error loss with the elastic-net penalty were jointly carried out to select the significantly differentially expressed miRNAs based on the miRNA profiles. Results: Three miRNAs including miR-16-5p, miR-451a, and miR-574-5p were identified as the powerful biomarkers for the diagnosis of ESCC. The diagnostic accuracy of the combination of these three miRNAs was evaluated by using logistic regression and the SVM. The averages of the area under the receiver operating curve and classification accuracies based on different classifiers were more than 0.80 and 0.79, respectively. The cross-validation results suggested that the three-miRNA-based classifiers could clearly distinguish ESCC patients from healthy controls. Moreover, the classifying performance of the miRNA panel persisted in discriminating the healthy group from patients with ESCC stage I-II (AUC > 0.76) and patients with ESCC stage III-IV (AUC > 0.80).

8b66c85534f02b21ff7f3352798ecc2d252edd92,Grey and White Matter Proportional Relationships in the Cerebellar Vermis Altered in Schizophrenia,"Magnetic resonance imaging studies frequently report abnormalities of the cerebellar vermis in schizophrenia, though with some discrepancies as to the nature and location of such abnormalities. Imaging studies typically investigate volumetric differences between groups. Yet substantial evidence supports the hypothesis that grey and white matter proportions in the mammalian brain are controlled by scaling relationships. If strong proportional relationships between grey and white matter tissue volumes are observed in the healthy vermis, then disturbances to these proportions might characterize vermian dysmorphology in schizophrenia. Measures of grey and white matter tissue volumes from three anatomical divisions of the vermis were obtained from 52 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 55 healthy controls. Cross-correlations of the tissue class volumes were computed for each subject group, controlling for age. The number of significant correlations in each group were compared. In addition, the grey/white matter ratio was computed within and across each vermian division. Differences in mean and variance were assessed using t and F tests. A false discovery rate of 0.05 controlled for multiple comparisons. Among controls, 11 of 15 correlations were significant. Among patients, eight of 15 correlations were significant. Five of the nine grey/white matter ratios had an increased mean in the patient group, and all of the variances were trend level or significantly increased in the patients. Tissue class volumes in the cerebellar vermis were strongly interrelated in controls. These relationships were disturbed in patients with schizophrenia.",2008,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Glenn Lawyer"", ids = ""47101955""); list(name = ""Ragnar NesvÃ¥g"", ids = ""3214470""); list(name = ""Katarina VarnÃ¤s"", ids = ""1829562""); list(name = ""Gaku Okugawa"", ids = ""4130708""); list(name = ""Ingrid Agartz"", ids = ""2775316"")",6900879fd6290baff713be779383f7ecc5c13146; f8c526db756271d27e1c508524421d39178b8b88; 9aa9122e276aded9c09ffbcad09c0927eb283726; 08ee1b5ae16d93fc9bcc1b8a0c221673343fdf5c; b6fc06a996f537a50deda522397f474e5c607c09; 873734ac916208705a4bc94afe7fb1729fb78f8f; f662ec3a5166692be094c4d5192210ab2cd20e4a; 1523f0cb7deebaf3698418f1f76a33b551da20b1; b505ba5054db1c0c70e6a86dbf6bbba747b5382d; fbca455dd0410007d5a6cc7cefd31b39ae704399; 8067631fed82ee6b0ef4952f032a1eb11123a7f6,f765fde57d26176f770ecdb498ae36d311989f78; 42df9fea80a760b6559c22ab5f2b33f37958fce6; ec055d6eba732b03b27f8722eb802f28443efb24; cb240290a91c67998c3e56e8dbebc7ac00771468; 2468411c72b3f3173057338b60776046eff414b1; ffb98577a8901498c8cf4b6688c8aeb55eb6fc1c; d637cde15e64b325b39b93963136d4d352c94276; 872ba98aaf60cabed8c6881df83e07550b80126f; e9b1535a054fe8adc51660938f9e4a8093fcab7f; 5a0d82ca0e62f2ba222dd37886b5a6b83837ee6a; 9da10f0506cbcd894538d12867cc7c7597fc69f2; 0d0ddbf05d71639e2eb74c6f49a529c3fafefc99; 79f7cdc0fa0ed6947c02e24fe689cb5d6f9ed6c6; 658e12c6fc77255cf00baeb2336d47bf163b067f; 4d8a5531ea15d954494ad6cd433031d26ffad4d7; 1eae3a33e24efd1a69220e32a3db9a9cf2e03203; f4786beb4bfc06fa8c474291b2594c85eca9aa15; ba941626846d02d86fd9011e9b9a0b83922f846f; 439da5b9be21e9690b4544a08dcdcb94a94db232; 38b138797226bb59a82896a76c69444f400bcac8; e742c0cf722ddbdc952df3ed13d92e439a1d1baf; 7e0e00dbe6a1bda89a187d407d59b32e7062e6b8; 005316045562fe87795c1ba799181f6a9f59f705; 52eb5529356c9a19ee4cc83c00438a5d07f77e33; e82890bb6a0238533baf6ce85c73a0a1f4d40269; fe354e4d497fba712fd9fc319f911256a7a9a990; c182ba7dffdbb78932d371c422edd1ea139a2569; bef5093fcce0ba094bad80efb8600086090fe792; d665aba327779db98622f5652a85df28693fedb9; a01db25a3c63ceb257f54cf03a57a5823d029b72; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 75287b02b3f8e29215270b52916c6fa80f4a5a83; 9280e13f2f1df792fafed8bea0df8b9ac8502188; 024a2ad3a0409bd101dad4f4fd83048e33bd24a3; cff7e5281fe983fe58060284340f9cfe468ae039; 31a19ca87f499198187529f8886a9cd95a86b693; f6eb49f49d9c651dfa3bad21385a8fd4c132d7a9; 28d5a753f25701516a115ce2461d406abed19c40; fc81582910468c5edbe8acb5e03794ecae77a86b; a3f0de311173a04834876c797e8611731f47eea4; 1f18d975ee46d813a91c91c9cceb82aa62f5e875; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; a7674decce35ae423b9f0076a53262a248b743cd; 9f7e331efb82302470450fa185891d289a23a60e; b1885162d76e058e7573359078d76c93098b74f6; 549c8f4d540b7129be736bdb3b9e24e8f496bf2f,The Cerebellum,8,52-60
dfbcedaa4ddfbd82bdb8f0b77fe239fada4a2f9f,MaCSim approach to assess the accuracy of individual matched records with varying block sizes and cut-off values,"Record linkage is the process of matching together the records from different data sources that belong to the same entity. Record linkage is increasingly being used by statistical, health, government and business organisations to link administrative, survey, population census and other files to create a robust file for more complete and comprehensive analysis. Despite this increase, there has been little work on developing tools to assess the accuracy of linked files. Ensuring that the matched records in the combined file actually correspond to the same individual or entity is crucial for the validity of any analyses and inferences based on the combined data. Haque et al. (submitted for publication) proposed a Markov Chain based Monte Carlo simulation approach (MaCSim) for assessing linkage accuracy and used ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) synthetic data to illustrate the utility of the approach. Different blocking strategies were considered to classify matches from non-matches with different levels of accuracy. In order to assess average accuracy of linking, correctly linked proportions were investigated for each record. The analyses indicated strong performance of the proposed method of assessment of accuracy of the linkages. In this paper, this method is employed to evaluate the accuracy of linkages, using varying block sizes and different cut-off values while minimizing error. The aim is to facilitate optimal choice of block size and cut-off value to achieve high accuracy in terms of minimizing the average False Discovery Rate (FDR) and False Negative Rate (FNR).",2020,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""S.

9e17df5a24ef0021d175eabcbcc7c7f851ae8666,Impact of brief exercise on peripheral blood NK cell gene and microRNA expression in young adults.,"Natural killers (NK) cells are unique innate immune cells that increase up to fivefold in the circulating blood with brief exercise and are known to play a key role in first-response defense against pathogens and cancer immunosurveillance. Whether exercise alters NK cell gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression is not known. Thirteen healthy men (20-29 yr old) performed ten 2-min bouts of cycle ergometer exercise at a constant work equivalent to an average of 77% of maximum O2 consumption interspersed with 1-min rest. Blood was drawn before and immediately after the exercise challenge. NK cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using a negative magnetic cell separation method. We used Affymetrix U133+2.0 arrays for gene expression and Agilent Human miRNA V2 Microarray for miRNAs. A stringent statistical approach (false discovery rate < 0.05) was used to determine that exercise significantly altered the expression of 986 genes and 23 miRNAs. Using in silico analysis, we found exercise-related gene pathways where there was a high likelihood of gene-miRNA interactions.

495fea6ac3f69b911e8344966bc01ee342d75bb3,Characterization of the transcriptome of chorioamniotic membranes at the site of rupture in spontaneous labor at term.,"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to compare the transcriptome between the site of membrane rupture and the chorioamniotic membranes away from the site of rupture.


STUDY DESIGN
The transcriptome of amnion and chorion (n=20 each) from and distal to the site of rupture from women with spontaneous labor and vaginal delivery at term after spontaneous rupture of membranes was profiled with Illumina HumanHT-12 microarrays. Selected genes were validated with the use of quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.


RESULTS
Six hundred seventy-seven genes were differentially expressed in the chorion between the rupture and nonrupture sites (false discovery rate<0.1; fold change>1.5). Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed the differential expression in 10 of 14 genes. Enriched biological processes included anatomic structure development, cell adhesion and signal transduction. Extracellular matrix-receptor interaction was the most impacted signaling pathway.


CONCLUSION
The transcriptome of fetal membranes after spontaneous rupture of membranes in term labor is characterized by region- and tissue-specific differential expression of genes that are involved in signature pathways, which include extracellular matrix-receptor interactions.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Chia-ling Nhan-Chang"", ids = ""1381192972""); list(name = ""Roberto Romero"", ids = ""145783429""); list(name = ""Adi L Tarca"", ids = ""2490889""); list(name = ""Pooja Mittal"", ids = ""2617153""); list(name = ""Juan Pedro Kusanovic"", ids = ""1987876""); list(name = ""Offer Erez"", ids = ""6858231""); list(name = ""Shali Mazakiâ\200\220Tovi"", ids = ""1398245652""); list(name = ""Tinnakorn Chaiworapongsa"", ids = ""3985187""); list(name = ""John W.

b18cb91d532661c38f31e4ae5d24c40ea5288045,Gene expression in the liver of rats fed alcohol by means of intragastric infusion.,"It has become increasingly evident that one of the most fruitful approaches to understanding cellular processes and their relation to disease consists of large-scale gene profiling of cells, tissues, and organs. This also constitutes a first step in exploring the molecular biologic basis of various diseases. In the current study, we used cDNA microarray technology to assess possible changes in the expression of a large number of genes in the liver of rats fed alcohol (ethanol) chronically (4 weeks) by means of intragastric infusion. This animal model resembles closely the alcoholic liver disease in human beings. Of a total of 8,740 probe sets arrayed on the microchip, 2,069 were expressed by the liver. After a correction for false discovery rate at 10%, 72 genes were found to be significantly up-regulated (40) or down-regulated (32). Forty-two genes were suppressed, and four genes were induced, by alcohol. These genes are involved in a wide spectrum of cellular functions. Also, the genes that underwent significant changes were categorized into two groups: genes that have been implicated in alcoholic liver disease and genes that have not been tested for possible changes in expression. Large-scale gene profiling of the liver reveals changes in the expression of a number of genes that have never been implicated in alcohol-induced injury. Further investigation of such genes may cast light on mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced liver injury and help in the design of new therapeutic approaches.",2004,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ion V.

However, in spite of common therapeutic regimes, HNSCC from different subsites have clear differences in their biology, with diverse growth patterns, metastatic rates and prognosis. To address these differences at the molecular level, 121 HNSCC samples (7 from nasal cavity (NAS), 55 from oral cavity (ORA), 35 from oropharynx (ORO), 6 from hipopharynx (HIP), 18 from larynx (LAR)), treated with surgery or surgery followed by radiotherapy were assayed through microarray technology.

06cb65e73b7656f4cd9050fa90d1330c36dc8631,Mass Gatherings and Diarrheal Disease Transmission among Rural Communities in Coastal Ecuador.,"Mass gatherings exacerbate infectious disease risks by creating crowded, high-contact conditions, and straining the capacity of local infrastructure. While mass gatherings have been extensively studied in the context of epidemic disease transmission, the role of gatherings in incidence of high-burden, endemic infections has not been previously studied. Here, we examine diarrheal incidence among seventeen communities in Esmeraldas, Ecuador, in relation to recurrent gatherings characterized using ethnographic data collected during and after the epidemiological surveillance period (2004-2007). Using distributed lag generalized estimating equations, adjusted for seasonality, trend, and heavy rainfall events, we found significant increases in diarrhea risk in host villages, peaking two weeks after an event's conclusion (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.21, confidence interval (CI), adjusted for false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05: 1.02, 1.43). Stratified analysis revealed heightened risks associated with events where crowding and travel were most likely (2-week lag IRR 1.51; CI, adjusted for false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05: 1.09, 2.10). Our findings suggest that community-scale mass gatherings may play an important role in endemic diarrheal disease transmission and could be an important focus for interventions to improve community health in low resource settings.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Philip A Collender"", ids = ""12132671""); list(name = ""Christa Morris"", ids = ""46805916""); list(name = ""Rose Glenn-Finer"", ids = ""1398949526""); list(name = ""AndrÃ©s Lamas Acevedo"", ids = ""121850976""); list(name = ""Howard H.

cf52abd06850a8c5d41abdad167146a329655aeb,Controlling Generalized Fwer and Generalized Fdr,"In many applications of multiple hypothesis testing where more than one false rejection can be tolerated, procedures controlling error rates measuring at least k false rejections, instead of at least one, for some fixed k â‰¥ 1 can potentially increase the ability of a procedure to detect false null hypotheses. The k-FWER, a generalized version of the usual familywise error rate (FWER), is such an error rate that has recently been introduced in the literature and procedures controlling it have been proposed. A further generalization of a result on the k-FWER is provided in this article. In addition, an alternative and less conservative notion of error rate, the k-FDR, is introduced in the same spirit as the k-FWER by generalizing the usual false discovery rate (FDR). A k-FWER procedure is constructed given any set of increasing constants by utilizing the kth order joint null distributions of the p-values without assuming any specific form of dependence among all the p-values. Procedures controlling the k-FDR are also developed by using the kth order joint null distributions of the p-values, first assuming that the sets of null and nonnull p-values are mutually independent or they are jointly positively dependent in the sense of being multivariate totally positive of order two (MTP2) and then discarding that assumption about the overall dependence among the p-values.",2008,,"list(name = ""Sanat K.

We measured fasting serum lipoproteins and genotyped 768 tagging or potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across 33 candidate gene regions in 401 Afro-Caribbeans older than 18 years belonging to 7 multi-generational pedigrees (mean family size 51, range 21-113, 3,426 relative pairs). All lipoproteins were significantly heritable (P<0.05). Gender-specific analysis showed that heritability for triglycerides was much higher (P<0.01) in women than in men (women, 0.62+/-0.18, P<0.01; men, 0.13+/-0.17, P>0.10), but the heritability for LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) was higher (P<0.05) in men than in women (men, 0.79+/-0.21, P<0.01; women, 0.39+/-0.12, P<0.01). The top 14 SNPs that passed the false discovery rate threshold in the families were then tested for replication in an independent population-based sample of 1,750 Afro-Caribbean men aged 40+ years. Our results revealed significant associations for three SNPs in two genes (rs5929 and rs6511720 in LDLR and rs7517090 in PCSK9) and LDL-C in both the family study and in the replication study. Our findings suggest that LDLR and PCSK9 variants may contribute to a variation in LDL-C among African ancestry individuals. Future sequencing and functional studies of these loci may advance our understanding of genetic factors contributing to LDL-C in African ancestry populations.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Iva Miljkovic"", ids = ""5551334""); list(name = ""Laura M Yerges-Armstrong"", ids = ""1395780333""); list(name = ""Lewis H.

b5f55ffc55e9587a9cdfc958ab01d28ea356afed,Essays on unit root testing in panel data,"This thesis discusses some issues on unit root testing in panel data. It first examines the intra-China price convergence by employing panel unit root tests that take cross-sectional dependence into account. Contrast to the existing literature, where tests assuming independence are employed and PPP is found in the vast majority of goods/services prices, our study finds mixed evidence in favor of PPP. Mixed panels with both I(1) and I(0) units are then considered, a large scale simulation study is undertaken. Size/power of panel unit root tests are examined under a variety of DGPs. A battery of procedures designed for mixed panels are employed, and their performance are examined by simulation. An application on intra-China PPP shows that, on average, only a small proportion of stationary units can be found in relative price panels. We then consider fractionally integrated processes and propose two different types of panel fractional integration test, a Fisher-type test and a multiple testing procedure that controls the false discovery rate (FDR) and classify units into null and alternative. Simulation evidence is provided. Empirical application shows that, in our intra-China PPP study, strong evidence can be found against the unit root null.",2014,Engineering,"list(name = ""Chong Zhao"", ids = ""51005409"")",,344d2aa025f677d22e69c99e5a5178a14549121c; e7492bcd4e9a9d399d8ab27a515b699c5ea9adcc; 838a7df9df103b3e54df596c9764200d345fcf12; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 1060a4198617e950116510ff1511c52d85934868; 3ce0ef04597a9bbb834bc246be0105f74f021afb; 72751df8997c051c10f0e09001e49d9686302ed8; fe284d7a55e13c0ea6730f7dc0a8d61bf51a1b0b; 59f106af5a10025b6c354f7be71cfc7c31cf8c75; ad08f497d672bb4303dc308ddcd1274df6fa4fc4; 89486159c908db3a1700ee8026176696b419bbf7; 6737263b384dcbfabe02e74ef07333496dc5af8e; b646127ca5d761d9c64b92ce540e7ec1c79c6f4f; 71d822593fb77bcec8553a1a435c5f6fd28ae6a8; 8e7d64703a0e64f6fd28644e29acb73e5be1bb85; c2677173ece5651590c26e9d3941bad02de55bb2; a959a4ca0f97b321505dc82c279bd9a5298b3b3d; ce0d2d85617bb04e7bcb3574e9d8a9e278c61682; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; ce7013e029109b1da8a43695cf108bafcacf7259; f53ffaf1a6fae94bf1651eac98e0c2f52a699827; 0cd35bef0a69ef5f4807c43532c77fbf44530b20; 3f97137dba4e14aad80e12b68e8e8b64c519df3a; d5dea3f509a5f9b577ed4ad8fc5a0b211f6fbb49; 3918b8327b294df4673b1357ceca16efff237f3b; 040b47ee153863eb1317fe5454e23bd80206c911; 250f4c0c8c0f784b43e393959d62b64ce4fde021; 9a3cab99dfeba4ffd5c9560a2db96335e74615a9; 0a9202b5618c1f70e803c47eb0897335ba065fd9; 3aace9b5b90896b5277b896c67153b81fd098c03; 052966c2982d5c6b993453928d82297cb90d54f5; 6eaf5f78265bf107e14504aadb5877104bd4c5a1; bb9061fa1dc31f384c765b89da3945d32a793eca; 43db684dc246d0f28a36b7cec3b84f1fe2cef0b4; c836dc883d5d58d7efe9bc42008dd4039ddff72c; 32e7df2d19f65fc59ad8b1df2b4f6e4881788528; cc3abcba3daa349fb5c65d129fb6e5487821b11e; ea5084f03b274ed07b6aa1d5b121bca94c98feb0; b7abd901f8246eb961ff0a83dfbc28813eda4b6c; adcfa3752be34149ddd5599078306768c1ca7cea; c0d9763193087845e5c6c870343f6893d4f71015; a4bfec13121d6c7da156bd75ba9c8863c767b1ec; edde41b22343ae15feba20a3da5d7253595fc449; a10e1ecf7221007f3b212032165ca70e28a96bd6; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; d2b3a5ec8ed380d19f4eb72bcd9202a25c14e7eb; 6e177038940a4bee5423e69e89596dcf91d2b115; d0f2175a2383f837711c602f6f1b175782adfaf5; 488b7c26085627bfcb58fdc8db1c6d45879dbcc3; 276be991dd62a963a46ebd83cd05fc431c0ac322; a5d2ac7cef2550903b4084c1cbe822018e3858a1; a3d22a37dacb3be5482b7f8b5e866e81adf3b342; 93ebb3d6d78e45a20ebf5d2356e7e139e765f08e; 9445aaa1e273464ffb1b96a7301e2c77cfb7df3d; 5cc74f5929efc2941460f797c9e9eb01cf049886; bbfbad1072c8abe0cbb74d0ddd41b6de046374de; 04a1de9ba5128dbef613316c7fcc72f291fd0522; 92963de8be299ae657a66d2c60e2d733952e4e36; d2370d6cb36273b2a2817e74a6d33568ec369a04; a17cd5c74d1e95193e0bad13af9a8218d1ee7c6f; ffea13e8bd9b6a12794001c004df4d33a543e06a; e97e6b85211c57b6d545741019f8763ce4899bb7; 833451635f88bf5314b2c29084b0f1f89ed8e59b; 2768677fedd21d53dc3582839cffcc6bc6811152; 9477e13644ab902185746fd93ff6e0425445ec7b; e4ab1fbeeaebfc457fb16cd366cf4745feae5a9a; bb579b75ed50b369dd892e4679571a6f7a686106; 41f3966a8ad1f10ad0c964217ce32121affb16d6; ce874d924fa97b2f789e4f8efa5f0f3a840b4683; 5ccd925444449ab83c10a2190eb419eeb674a4e8; aeee434bcc7715445b311e491edadb0a759e788a; de01c828b5e94bb6fa087022e9ddc09a4497664e; 1cd88161e6f36704c2a75f5656fcf9527d931de0; a6fff19333054460ce64bbb05c714c2d781b2e1f; 6da988545efb1adbd2bb684c6292fc04bf0aa875; d7f6f5634b6b41f238cb066f08f12f0b1d886847; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e5edd436c601923923abc8ab7731631b3e8e64b7; 28edfa78119abbf73d7b409c9d9b9cbd2bc1be6c; 23b250895f5823b4842638ee2fac124d9a406331; ee1014390904db3c2c7c1f81719f49450e621a70; eff4b72e9aadcb216f9ccd12c81f5bf0b714c2c9; c64d995b36b0e1345f5248a04b2575614e4c1299; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e,,,

Different polymorphisms in clock genes have been studied in healthy humans, providing inconsistent results in different populations. In this study, we evaluated the possibility that two non-synonymous polymorphisms in PER2 (p.Gly1244Glu, rs934945) and PER3 (p.Met1028Thr, rs2640909) genes might be associated with diurnal preference in healthy Colombian subjects. A total of 209 Colombian university students were genotyped for two functional polymorphisms in PER2 and PER3 genes (rs934945 and rs2640909). We applied the composite scale of morningness (CSM) to measure phenotypic patterns of human diurnal preference. Additionally, we extracted from the CSM three subscale scores (""morningness"", ""activity planning"" and ""morning alertness""). We used a false discovery rate approach (q values) for correction of multiple testing. PER2 (rs934945) showed a significant association with two CSM subscale scores: ""activity planning"" and ""morning alertness"". For PER3 (rs2640909), we observed an association with the ""morningness"" CSM subscale scores. We found a significant association between novel and functional polymorphisms in PER2 and PER3 genes with specific CSM subscales for diurnal preference. We showed for the first time the association of rs934945 with ""morning alertness"" and rs2640909 with ""morningness"". We suggest that these results should be replicated in order to confirm the association in other populations. Finally, the study of additional novel functional polymorphisms in other clock genes could be of relevance for a deep understanding of circadian phenotypes and neuropsychiatric disorders.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Diego Armijos Ojeda"", ids = ""144475156""); list(name = ""Claudia S.

8daa038d8f9b5f22ef0324f87b5e48c632f228f4,Neutrophil activation signature in juvenile idiopathic arthritis indicates the presence of low-density granulocytes,"Objective
JIA is an autoimmune, inflammatory disease with involvement of innate and adaptive immune responses. However, the role of neutrophils in JIA pathogenesis remains unclear. This study aimed to identify and validate neutrophil gene expression signatures in JIA using public microarray datasets and new clinical samples.


Methods
Three suitable datasets were analysed by significance analysis of microarray and Ingenuity. Neutrophils and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from a new cohort of JIA patients and healthy paediatric controls (HCs). Gene expression was validated using quantitative PCR. Serum concentrations of proteins were measured using ELISA. Low-density granulocytes (LDGs) in JIA and HC PBMCs were quantified by flow cytometry using forward/side-scatter properties.


Results
Ingenuity identified transcriptional regulation (false discovery rate < 0.05) by G-CSF, GM-CSF and IL-8 along with expression of neutrophil granule protein genes including ELANE, MPO, MMP8 and MMP9 in datasets from JIA PBMCs. LDG counts were elevated in JIA compared with HCs (2.5% vs 1.4%; P = 0.007). Transcripts for MMP8 (P = 0.005), MPO (P = 0.0124) and FcÎ³ Receptor 1B (FCÎ³R1B) (P = 0.0417) were significantly higher in JIA compared with HC neutrophils. MMP9 protein levels were lower in systemic JIA patient sera [355.95 ng/ml (s.d. 250.03)] compared with HCs [675.41 ng/ml (s.d. 181.17); P = 0.007], but levels of elastase, MPO and MMP8 were not significantly different.


Conclusion
LDGs are elevated in JIA and contribute to the transcriptomic profile of JIA PBMCs. JIA neutrophils express higher levels of MMP8 and FCGR1B, which may be implicated in disease pathology through the release of proteases and reactive oxygen metabolites, causing systemic inflammation and damage to joints.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kavitha Ramanathan"", ids = ""49241760""); list(name = ""Anna Glaser"", ids = ""49716048""); list(name = ""Hanna Lythgoe"", ids = ""16052286""); list(name = ""Joanne Ong"", ids = ""6872802""); list(name = ""Michael W Beresford"", ids = ""83561890""); list(name = ""Angela Midgley"", ids = ""16959517""); list(name = ""Helen L Wright"", ids = ""37076837"")",99be91f03670f3a7b11fb86993d3756fb5f25a1f; e37bb6c3c544ba329c0c2e35ab70a7c4bc02573d; 6fc932edba45b8fa16dabd1578bdf618300c66bd; be4372c7e7de8fa1cd264389138663370caffde5; ef231836d40def35fd5e4bc78d392af54d8ba1f3,6f27acb18f2b6c4484740c05fe872e8fa13f1f85; 38838dbed5b59b7e80c2b77a81bb3b6f3c2253f6; 176ca9f4c3541e2605f6d170f554eb80be051613; 842cd098cd8742cfeba228b6aa25541da9901855; 4520eddbb90b047abed822daf000ea068caf2122; 90917fd4c6a09c0c0cbff250baba7145191b9925; 536b638d1c501255bb3c290bbc1181cff85e986f; 0cb9cd2a21289e07a1538ce98b92a0f7bc6ae1a2; 63bc2416d55b9c94b3cd2f02c3db8f8d0880725d; c9f83c8bd39f3080a45b17937f50fd46fcef93c2; f0d28707b20b6cf717364b245811b6f10b738d0e; 8ac0de14582575f30347e5cb2fc99e2c8121534e; 266d1490dee00a374f6b75e931d5e61f33916ca9; 897594af31b3b692c28875c74caad3efb02ec93e; 2d587c3848fe78797d5a85ebc7281c263495bc77; 37be5ea7fae33a4a9ea4a43da5812e7203d6f40e; 1b41da875878b51cfa2abf33348255464f3275b9; 0289216b0961ad16d91f448e12840dfce8de1f63; f143329f4125a810b090324b0278e6e44ca30ff8; 2dfcfacde16cadff90701cfef0cc8195a0946bcf; c59d0f0ccf8b24054f4ac7473c1ce2ddc8764a14,Rheumatology,57,488â€“498

Recent advances in our understanding of PTCL biology have enabled the identification of novel therapeutic targets that could lead to individualized biomarker-driven therapy (Intlekofer & Younes, 2014). Many pharmacological compounds against various proteins of the RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK1 pathway have been developed, conferring clinical benefits for the treatment of solid tumours (Kohno & Pouyssegur, 2006). Moreover, many of the genes involved in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK1) activation were mutated in a range of tumour subtypes (Davies et al, 2002). Furthermore, the use of conventional immunohistochemical techniques could enable us to identify the activation pathway by visualizing nuclear localization of the phosphorylated MAPK1 (also termed p-ERK) protein. All these data suggest that the RAS/RAF/MAPK1 pathway is well worth exploring in molecularly targeted orphan tumours, such as nodal-PTCLs (n-PTCLs). In the study reported here, we wanted to establish whether p-MAPK1 expression was of any biological relevance in n-PTCL. We first analysed pathways involved in PTCL tumourigenesis in a series of 37 frozen n-PTCLs samples [20 peripheral T-cell lymphomas not specified (PTCL-NOS) and 17 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas (AITL)] and 6 reactive lymph nodes for control samples which were hybridized on a Whole-Human-Genome-Oligo-Microarray. Using GeneSet-Enrichment-Analysis-Software, we identified 24 gene sets significantly enriched at a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0 250 in the n-PTCL cases compared with reactive lymph nodes (Table SI). Pathways identified in the n-PTCL cases included MAPK1 (P = 0 014, FDR = 0 033), amongst others. Tissue micro arrays (TMA) were also constructed from an independent group of 84 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded PTCL patients homogeneously treated with CHOP (cyclophosphamide doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone)/ CHOP-like regimens, including 46 AITL and 38 PTCL-NOS, and TMA sections were stained by the Endvision method with a heat-induced antigen-retrieval step for p-MAPK1. Cases were considered positive for p-MAPK1 when more than 20% of tumoural cells showed nuclear staining. Interestingly, p-MAPK1 was found to be positive not only in tumoural cells but also in follicular dendritic cells, vascular endothelium (used as internal control), and other unspecified stromal dendritic cells. To be sure of the neoplastic condition of the positive cells, double immunohistochemistry for pMAPK1/PD1 (PDCD1) and p-MAPK1/CD23 (FCER2) was performed on TMA sections (Supplemental Information). Reactive tonsil tissue was included as a control. The primary antibodies were omitted to provide negative controls (Table SII). Patientâ€™s clinical data and GEP data have been reported in a previous study (Manso et al, 2014). Nuclear immunostaining p-MAPK1 was detected in tumoural cells in 29 8% of the patients (25 of 84 PTCLs) (Fig 1). Interestingly, nuclear p-MAPK1 expression was more frequent in AITL (39 1%) than in PTCL-NOS (18 4%) cases (P = 0 039). No clinical data were significantly different in p-MAPK1-positive and p-MAPK1-negative patients in comparisons either of the whole series of cases or after their histological subclassification (AITL vs. PTCL-NOS) (Tables SIIIâ€“SV).

ebbc08edf7b3950f78aae259cf9e3ae8ac59295f,Detection and interpretation of shared genetic influences on 42 human traits,"We performed a scan for genetic variants associated with multiple phenotypes by comparing large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 42 traits or diseases. We identified 341 loci (at a false discovery rate of 10%) associated with multiple traits. Several loci are associated with multiple phenotypes; for example, a nonsynonymous variant in the zinc transporter SLC39A8 influences seven of the traits, including risk of schizophrenia (rs13107325: log-transformed odds ratio (log OR) = 0.15, P = 2 Ã— 10âˆ’12) and Parkinson disease (log OR = âˆ’0.15, P = 1.6 Ã— 10âˆ’7), among others. Second, we used these loci to identify traits that have multiple genetic causes in common. For example, variants associated with increased risk of schizophrenia also tended to be associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, we developed a method to identify pairs of traits that show evidence of a causal relationship. For example, we show evidence that increased body mass index causally increases triglyceride levels.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Joseph K.

c1b4b0b9a22eed18a259168d959edc740d94f60e,Improved Visualization of the Necrotic Zone after Microwave Ablation Using Computed Tomography Volume Perfusion in an In Vivo Porcine Model,"After hepatic microwave ablation, the differentiation between fully necrotic and persistent vital tissue through contrast enhanced CT remains a clinical challenge. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate new imaging modalities, such as CT perfusion (CTP) to improve the visualization of coagulation necrosis. MWA and CTP were prospectively performed in five healthy pigs. After the procedure, the pigs were euthanized, and the livers explanted. Orthogonal histological slices of the ablations were stained with a vital stain, digitalized and the necrotic core was segmented. CTP maps were calculated using a dual-input deconvolution algorithm. The segmented necrotic zones were overlaid on the DICOM images to calculate the accuracy of depiction by CECT/CTP compared to the histological reference standard. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine the agreement/true positive rate and disagreement/false discovery rate between CECT/CTP and histology. Standard CECT showed a true positive rate of 81% and a false discovery rate of 52% for display of the coagulation necrosis. Using CTP, delineation of the coagulation necrosis could be improved significantly through the display of hepatic blood volume and hepatic arterial blood flow (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The ratios of true positive rate/false discovery rate were 89%/25% and 90%/50% respectively.

51d9206c0ec5ffb455b5d58002c0cf34ab8f740b,A new estimate of the proportion unchanged genes in a microarrayexperiment,"BackgroundIn the analysis of microarray data one generally produces a vector of p-values that for each gene give the likelihood of obtaining equally strong evidence of change by pure chance. The distribution of these p-values is a mixture of two components corresponding to the changed genes and the unchanged ones. The basic question 'What proportion of genes is changed' is a non-trivial one, with implications for the way that such experiments are analysed. An estimate not requiring any assumptions on the distributions is proposed and evaluated. The approach relies on the concept of a moment generating function.ResultsA simulation model of real microarray data was used to assess the proposed method. The method fared very well, and gave evidence of low bias and very low variance.ConclusionsThe approach opens up a new possibility of sharpening the inference concerning microarray experiments, including more stable estimates of the false discovery rate.",2004,Biology,"list(name = ""Per Broberg"", ids = ""1975483"")",56f76d7b283fad276eaeaf5a86b3516cbf8c3e68; 44d86f3ba9167f4931dae729d814c13fbc7a0efb; 0cc325ee022c258b30da3247a60828f7adf4d14c; 7c62354b2ddee17616e3d68758662a9d42c65a3c; 93dd1ad905da7b09568aaf7d04c3d325772d42fc; 56d17f14f1eb41c7be3c5e1a964c3a6ef4a31c63; 96401004ad3ab64af3482d575ae25598913f5ce3; c12b1fcd5b2e10e1e88470aa4ad55d1f4b7d087e,e520cc396db99a52c1f0a67c0539b68f268f7669; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 2def5ea8b905c5742e989279f14bab82e560a07e; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 4ca30db9097d20f156214eea4a2ae5a8893ebb66; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74,Genome Biology,5,1-10

Epidemiological studies have reported associations between particulate matter (PM) concentrations and cancer and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. DNA methylation has been identified as a possible link but so far it has only been analyzed in candidate sites.


OBJECTIVES
We studied the association between DNA methylation and short- and mid-term air pollution exposure using genome-wide data and identified potential biological pathways for additional investigation.


METHODS
We collected whole blood samples from three independent studies-KORA F3 (2004-2005) and F4 (2006-2008) in Germany, and the Normative Aging Study (1999-2007) in the United States-and measured genome-wide DNA methylation proportions with the Illumina 450k BeadChip. PM concentration was measured daily at fixed monitoring stations and three different trailing averages were considered and regressed against DNA methylation: 2-day, 7-day and 28-day. Meta-analysis was performed to pool the study-specific results.


RESULTS
Random-effect meta-analysis revealed 12 CpG (cytosine-guanine dinucleotide) sites as associated with PM concentration (1 for 2-day average, 1 for 7-day, and 10 for 28-day) at a genome-wide Bonferroni significance level (p â‰¤ 7.5E-8); 9 out of these 12 sites expressed increased methylation. Through estimation of I2 for homogeneity assessment across the studies, 4 of these sites (annotated in NSMAF, C1orf212, MSGN1, NXN) showed p > 0.05 and I2 < 0.5: the site from the 7-day average results and 3 for the 28-day average. Applying false discovery rate, p-value < 0.05 was observed in 8 and 1,819 additional CpGs at 7- and 28-day average PM2.5 exposure respectively.


CONCLUSION
The PM-related CpG sites found in our study suggest novel plausible systemic pathways linking ambient PM exposure to adverse health effect through variations in DNA methylation.

Appropriate multiplicity adjustment is crucial to guarantee replicability of findings, and the false discovery rate (FDR) is frequently adopted as a measure of global error. In the interest of interpretability, results are often summarized so that reporting focuses on variants discovered to be associated to some phenotypes. We show that applying FDR-controlling procedures on the entire collection of hypotheses fails to control the rate of false discovery of associated variants as well as the expected value of the average proportion of false discovery of phenotypes influenced by such variants. We propose a simple hierarchical testing procedure that allows control of both these error rates and provides a more reliable basis for the identification of variants with functional effects. We demonstrate the utility of this approach through simulation studies comparing various error rates and measures of power for genetic association studies of multiple traits. Finally, we apply the proposed method to identify genetic variants that impact flowering phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, expanding the set of discoveries.",2016,Mathematics; Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christine B.

Genetic dissection of cytonuclear epistasis is fundamentally important to understand the genetic architecture of complex traits. In this study, a two-dimensional genome scan strategy was employed to evaluate the contribution of cytoplasm, quantitative trait loci (QTL), QTLÃ—QTL interactions and QTLÃ—QTLÃ—cytoplasm interactions to the phenotypic variation. The p-value and parameter value for each genetic effect were calculated by multiple regression analysis. A stepwise approach was suggested to build confidence in candidate QTL on the basis of q-value estimation, false discovery rate calculation and Bonferroni adjustment. A fine-scale grid scan strategy was proposed for further analysis of peaks of interest. Plant height in maize was used as an example to illustrate the efficiency of the two-dimensional genome scan strategy.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Zaixiang Tang"", ids = ""7172216""); list(name = ""Zhiqiu Hu"", ids = ""5802323""); list(name = ""Zefeng Yang"", ids = ""2922753""); list(name = ""Bo Yu"", ids = ""145523773""); list(name = ""Chenwu Xu"", ids = ""2717567"")",22bea75f2a02bf146f168e0b4bbc3858216de470,,Chinese Science Bulletin,57,2675-2680

Getting insights into the composition of these EVs will help unravel their functions in homeostasis and smoking-induced pathology. Here, we characterized the proteomic composition of basal and CSE-induced airway epithelial EVs. BEAS-2B cells were left unexposed or exposed to 1% CSE for 24 h, followed by EV isolation using ultrafiltration and size exclusion chromatography. Isolated EVs were labelled with tandem mass tags and their proteomic composition was determined using nano-LC-MS/MS. Tissue factor (TF) activity was determined by a factor Xa generation assay, phosphatidylserine (PS) content by prothrombinase assay and thrombin generation using calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT). Nano-LC-MS/MS identified 585 EV-associated proteins with high confidence. Of these, 201 were differentially expressed in the CSE-EVs according to the moderated t-test, followed by false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment with the FDR threshold set to 0.1. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that 24 proteins of the pathway haemostasis were significantly up-regulated in CSE-EVs, including TF. Increased TF expression on CSE-EVs was confirmed by bead-based flow cytometry and was associated with increased TF activity. CSE-EVs caused faster and more thrombin generation in normal human plasma than control-EVs, which was partly TF-, but also PS-dependent. In conclusion, proteomic analysis allowed us to predict procoagulant properties of CSE-EVs which were confirmed in vitro.

7282ef4f0775c69eb3f80933f7446a9a8decb254,Assessing the accuracy of detecting mouse brain structure changes from MRI using simulated deformations,"Introduction The use of image registration techniques to investigate shape differences in mouse brain MRIs have become a significant area of interest [1-3]. The ability of these techniques to bring brains into alignment have been well documented [4,5], however, it is unknown how accurately structural changes between groups can be detected or whether this sensitivity varies with brain geography or structure shape. Here we present a novel method to simulate deformation fields with known structural tissue shrinkage or growth and subsequently attempt to recover the induced changes in 21 structures of the mouse brain. Methods A simulated deformation field inspired by [6] was created as follows: using a 3D atlas of the mouse brain with 62 structures identified [7], a target Jacobian determinant map was created, in which any voxel of one structure received a reduced determinant (less than 1, i.e., tissue shrinkage), while the remaining part of the brain was assigned a determinant of 1 (no change). Concurrently, a tolerance map was created to indicate areas outside of the brain which were permitted to deform (i.e., grow/shrink) to accommodate the induced changes in the brain. A deformation field with zero vectors was initialized and iteratively adjusted by updating the vectors of each voxelâ€™s six nearest neighbours until the resulting vector field yielded the same determinant map as was inputted, using the tolerance map to park volume changes in areas outside the brain. To test the ability of a registration algorithm to recover induced structural changes, 21 of the relatively larger structures of the mouse brain were chosen and deformation fields simulated which featured a structural tissue loss of 0.5 to 10 percent. A set of 20 identical wild type fixed brain MRI scans were then selected and the simulated deformation field applied to half of them. An iterative registration procedure, previously applied to multiple phenotyping studies [3,8,9], was then applied to these 20 brains and the resulting Jacobian determinants of the deformation fields analyzed for structural group differences. Multiple comparisons were accounted for using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) [10].",2009,,"list(name = ""Matthijs C. van Eede"", ids = ""2092453""); list(name = ""R.

In addition to changes in adipose tissue, numerous studies have reported alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism. Livers of CLA-fed mice gain mass, partly due to lipid accumulation; however, the precise molecular mechanisms are unknown. To elucidate these mechanisms, we examined fatty acid composition and gene expression profiles of livers from a polygenic obese line of mice fed 1% trans-10, cis-12-CLA for 14 days. Analysis of gene expression data led to the identification of 1393 genes differentially expressed in the liver of CLA-fed male mice at a nominal P value of .01, and 775 were considered significant using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of .05. While surprisingly few genes in lipid metabolism were impacted, pathway analysis found that protein kinase A (PKA) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathways signaling pathways were affected by CLA treatment and 98 of the 775 genes were found to be regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha, a transcription factor important in controlling liver metabolic status.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Melissa S.

eac3422d2b02e25ce10dbc74b2a590645267ca33,2-3-2010 Wavelet Based Functional Models for Transcriptome Analysis with Tiling Arrays,"See next page for additional authors This working paper is hosted by The Berkeley Electronic Press (bepress) and may not be commercially reproduced without the permission of the copyright holder. For a better understanding of the biology of an organism a complete description is needed of all regions of the genome that are actively transcribed. Tiling arrays can be used for this purpose. Such arrays allow the discovery of novel transcripts and the assessment of differential expression between two or more experimental conditions such as genotype, treatment, tissue, etc. Much of the initial methodological efforts were designed for transcript discovery, while more recent developments also focus on differential expression. To our knowledge no methods for tiling arrays are described in the literature that can both assess transcript discovery and identify differentially expressed transcripts, simultaneously. The wavelet based functional model developed in this paper is designed to fill this methodologi-cal void. As opposed to existing methods, our statistical framework also permits a natural integration of preprocessing into the standard statistical analysis flow of tiling array data. We use Johnson transformations , which are based on cumulants, for computing false discovery rates (FDRs) and Bayesian credibility intervals for the estimates of the effect functions within the data space. A case study illustrates that our model is well suited for a simultaneous assessment of transcript discovery and differential expression, while remaining competitive with methods that perform only one of these tasks. 1. Introduction. In the last decade the genomes of many organisms have been entirely sequenced (e.g. Kim et al., 2006). A detailed description of all genomic regions that are actively transcribed is needed for enhancing the knowledge of the organisms functioning and the regulation of its transcriptional networks. The complete set of these RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcriptome. It seems almost impossible to derive the entire transcriptome from the complete genome sequence alone. In addition, the transcriptome and the transcription level can vary considerably between different tissues and they typically depend on external environmental conditions (e.g. Halasz et al., 2006). Thus, expression profiling has to be assessed experimentally. Genomic tiling arrays can provide an unbiased quantification",2013,,"list(name = ""Kristof De Beuf"", ids = ""2889290""); list(name = ""Ciprian M.

Most existing methods that aim to utilize group structure among hypotheses either employ the groupwise mixture model or weight all p-values or hypotheses. Thus, their powers can be improved when the groupwise mixture model is inappropriate or when most groups contain only true null hypotheses. Motivated by this, we propose a grouped, selectively weighted FDR procedure, which we refer to as ""sGBH"". Specifically, without employing the groupwise mixture model, sGBH identifies groups of hypotheses of interest, weights p-values in each such group only, and tests only the selected hypotheses using the weighted p-values. The sGBH subsumes a standard grouped, weighted FDR procedure which we refer to as ""GBH"". We provide simple conditions to ensure the conservativeness of sGBH, together with empirical evidence on its much improved power over GBH.

749d827c16c040825975aa106c61ad72aad9bafc,Combining Results of Multiple Search Engines,"A crucial component of the analysis of shotgun proteomics datasets is the search engine, an algorithm that attempts to identify the peptide sequence from the parent molecular ion that produced each fragment ion spectrum in the dataset. There are many different search engines, both commercial and open source, each employing a somewhat different technique for spectrum identification. The set of high-scoring peptide-spectrum matches for a defined set of input spectra differs markedly among the various search engine results; individual engines each provide unique correct identifications among a core set of correlative identifications. This has led to the approach of combining the results from multiple search engines to achieve improved analysis of each dataset. Here we review the techniques and available software for combining the results of multiple search engines and briefly compare the relative performance of these techniques. Molecular & Cellular Proteomics 12: 10.1074/mcp.R113.027797, 2383â€“ 2393, 2013. The most commonly used proteomics approach, shotgun proteomics, has become an invaluable tool for the highthroughput characterization of proteins in biological samples (1). This workflow relies on the combination of protein digestion, liquid chromatography (LC) 1 separation, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and sophisticated data analysis in its aim to derive an accurate and complete set of peptides and their inferred proteins that are present in the sample being studied. Although many variations are possible, the typical workflow begins with the digestion of proteins into peptides with a protease, typically trypsin. The resulting peptide mixture is first separated via LC and then subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The MS instrument acquires fragment ion spectra on a subset of the peptide precursor ions that it measures. From the MS/MS spectra that measure the abundance and mass of the peptide ion fragments, peptides present in the mixture are identified and proteins are inferred by means of downstream computational analysis. The informatics component of the shotgun proteomics workflow is crucial for proper data analysis (2), and a wide variety of tools have emerged for this purpose (3). The typical informatics workflow can be summarized in a few steps: conversion from vendor proprietary formats to an open format, high-throughput interpretation of the MS/MS spectra with a search engine, and statistical validation of the results with estimation of the false discovery rate at a selected score threshold. Various tools for measuring relative peptide abundances may be applied, dependent on the type of quantitation technique applied in the experiment. Finally, the proteins present, and their abundance in the sample, are inferred based on the peptide identifications. One of the most computationally intensive and diverse steps in the computational analysis workflow is the use of a",2013,Chemistry,"list(name = ""David D.

Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of upper and/or lower motor neurons with white matter changes in the corticospinal, corticobulbar, commissural and frontotemporal regions. Evaluation of functional cortical connectivity can shed light on the underlying affected brain regions and networks, and hence the disease pathophysiology. Design/Methods: Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 128 channels in 3 sets (2 minutes each) from 101 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (79 spinal onset, 15 bulbar onset, 7 ALS-FTD, age: 60.2 Â± 11.1), 8 patients with frontotemporal dementia (separately recruited and analysed), and 34 age-matched healthy individuals. The ALS-specific functional connectivity was quantified using frequency-domain cortico-cortical coherence and spectral power of the EEG. Results: The patient groups showed: lower spectral power in Î¸ band but higher coherence in Î¸ and Î³ bands. These findings were statistically significant as assessed by adaptive false discovery rate, fdr, (q = 0.05) and were confirmed by empirical Bayesian inference for the changes in spectral power (fdr 0.8) and cortico-cortical coherence (fdr 0.9). Structural MRI scores were correlated with EEG changes in a subset of 51 spinal-onset patients. Degeneration in motor cortical regions and corticospinal tracts were primarily correlated with changes in spectral power that were in the same direction as ALS-specific changes, whereas increased coherences on EEG correlated with extra-motor regions on MRI. Conclusions: The decreased spectral power in motor areas is a direct consequence of the structural degeneration and the increased coherences reflect increased functional connectivity in the brain networks which may be a compensatory neural activity. Spectral EEG is a promising biomarker of neurodegeneration, and provides additional information that complements structural changes detected by MRI.

3da8f768598ae726b128fc9d9474e286d61cd9d2,"Estimators of the proportion of false null hypotheses: I ""universal construction via Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral equations and uniform consistency under independence""","The proportion of false null hypotheses is a very important quantity in statistical modelling and inference based on the two-component mixture model and its extensions, and in control and estimation of the false discovery rate and false non-discovery rate. Most existing estimators of this proportion threshold p-values, deconvolve the mixture model under constraints on the components, or depend heavily on the location-shift property of distributions. Hence, they usually are not consistent, applicable to non-location-shift distributions, or applicable to discrete statistics or p-values. To eliminate these shortcomings, we construct uniformly consistent estimators of the proportion as solutions to Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral equations. In particular, we provide such estimators respectively for random variables whose distributions have separable characteristic functions, form discrete natural exponential families with infinite supports, and form natural exponential families with separable moment sequences.

911becd87f76a4bc70201f296571ab40dd8a874c,On-line control of false discovery rates for multiple datastreams,"Abstract Although some false discovery rate control procedures have been proposed in the continual surveillance of high dimensional datastreams, most of them ignore the sequential feature over the time domain and dependence information among the stream observations. This inspires us to exploit the sequential feature by restricting the ongoing streams at each time point to be a dynamic set, which is determined by previous complex controlling procedures. Based on the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) scheme, we develop a dynamic multiple testing procedure for high dimensional datastreams with the control of false discovery rates (FDR). The FDR is shown to be controlled pointwise under the condition that the average of correlations of the stream observations decreases to zero at a polynomial rate. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed method is able to deliver satisfactory control performance.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Lilun Du"", ids = ""51417074""); list(name = ""Changliang Zou"", ids = ""3005204"")",,,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference,194,1-14
becda6b13a0f881dbde9b94a1bc8c4955a2b3d86,Abstract A10: A mutagenesis screen identifies tumor suppressors and kinases as potential driver genes of ovarian cancer,"Background: The goal of this project is to increase our understanding of the molecular aetiology of ovarian cancer by utilizing Sleeping Beauty (SB) insertional mutagenesis. Methods: Breeding colonies of the following genetically engineered mice were established and cross bred: homozygous floxed SB (STOCK Rosa26-LsL-D-SB11;T2/Onc2,TG6113 ), homozygous floxed Brca1 knock-out ( C57BL/6.Brca1 tm2Brn ) and Tp53 mutant ( C57BL/6-Trp53 tm1Tyj/J ). CRE recombinase packaged into an adenoviral vector (AdCreM2, MicroBix Biosystems Inc, CA) was surgically injected under the ovarian bursal membrane of mature female mice to delete Brca1 and activate SB mutagenesis in the ovarian surface epithelium. Mice were monitored and sacrificed at ethically defined endpoints or a maximum of 15 months post-surgery. Tumors were assessed for SB transposase activity by immunohistochemical staining. DNA was extracted from paraffin embedded sections of ovarian tumors and underwent high-throughput sequencing for T2/Onc2 insertion sites (Illumina, University of Iowa). Genes with insertion sites were interrogated against SEOC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify genes also altered in the human malignancy. Functional annotation clustering was performed using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery, v6.7). Results: Ovarian tumors were observed at low penetrance starting at 30 weeks post-surgery in SB flox/+ Tp53 mut/+ mice (6%, 3/48) and SB flox/+ Brca1 flox/flox p53 mut/+ mice (8%, 4/50). No ovarian tumors were observed in SB flox/+ Brca1 flox/flox mice (n=38) or in SB flox/+ Brca1 flox/+ mice (n=26). Sequencing of the insertion sites identified a number of genes of which 67 were altered in 10 - 30% of cases in the TCGA SEOC dataset (N = 316). This gene-set was enriched for kinases (P = 0.003, False discovery rate (FDR) = 3%) including Fgfr2, Dyrk1a and Gsk3b , and small GTPase regulators (P = 0.01, FDR = 11%) including Smap2, Trio and Dock10 . Other genes of interest included tumor suppressor genes Arid1b, Cdh4 and Wwox and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ube3a . In the TCGA dataset, decreased progression free survival was associated with high expression of GSK3B, TRIO and UBE3A and low expression of WWOX . Conclusions: This screen identified a number of novel potential driver genes of ovarian cancer. In addition genes previously associated with ovarian cancer were also identified, providing proof of principle for this approach. Investigation of these novel genes may lead to further insights into the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer.

c4f2d0bfb4d541dc85ea96e4f6a0e54396d76ff5,Nonparametric Assessment of Contamination in Multivariate Data Using Minimum Volume Sets and FDR,"Large, multivariate datasets from high-throughput instrumentation have become ubiquitous throughout the sciences. Frequently, it is of great interest to characterize the measurements in these datasets by the extent to which they represent â€˜nominalâ€™ versus â€˜contaminatedâ€™ instances. However, often the nature of even the nominal patterns in the data are unknown and potentially quite complex, making their explicit parametric modeling a daunting task. In this paper, we introduce a nonparametric method for the simultaneous annotation of multivariate data (called MN-SCAnn), by which one may produce an annotated ranking of the observations, indicating the relative extent to which each may or may not be considered nominal, while making minimal assumptions on the nature of the nominal distribution. In our framework each observation is linked to a corresponding minimum volume set and, implicitly adopting a hypothesis testing perspective, each set is associated with a test, which in turn is accompanied by a certain false discovery rate. The combination of minimum volume set methods with false discovery rate principles, in the context of contaminated data, is new. Moreover, estimation of the key underlying quantities requires that a number of issues be addressed. We illustrate MN-SCAnn through examples in two contexts â€“ the pre-processing of cell-based assays in bioinformatics, and the detection of anomalous traffic patterns in Internet measurement studies.",2007,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Clayton Scott"", ids = ""40531965""); list(name = ""Eric D.

We studied DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of purified intestinal epithelial cells from ulcerative colitis patients, comparing inflamed and non-inflamed areas of the colon. We identified 577 differentially methylated sites (false discovery rate <0.2) mapping to 210 genes. From gene expression data from the same epithelial cells, we identified 62 differentially expressed genes with increased expression in the presence of inflammation at prostate cancer susceptibility genes PRAC1 and PRAC2. Four genes showed inverse correlation between methylation and gene expression; ROR1, GXYLT2, FOXA2, and, notably, RARB, a gene previously identified as a tumor suppressor in colorectal adenocarcinoma as well as breast, lung and prostate cancer.

9b2fa4cd155bcf9adb91103d3c9307f607ddd3bf,An Empirical Bayes Approach for Methylation Differentiation at the Single Nucleotide Resolution.,"DNA methylation is an important epigenetic phenomenon that is associated with a variety of diseases, particularly cancers. Recent development of high throughput sequencing technology has enabled researchers to investigate the methylation rate at a single nucleotide resolution for any given sample. Testing for methylation rate equality or difference between two samples, however, is challenged by the small sample size observed at many sites across the genome. Fisher's exact test is typically used in this situation; however, it is conservative and it cannot be used to test for specific difference in methylation rate between two samples. In this paper, we propose an empirical Bayes approach that utilizes the genome-wide data as prior information for methylation differentiation between two samples. We show that this new approach is more powerful than Fisher's exact test. In addition, it can be used to test for any specific methylation difference while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). The new method is applied to a real data set from a colon tumor study.",2010,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""K. J.

4fa29fb6058ac6ac52e6e337b35565656416126c,Genetic sequence variants (GSV) in relation to acute and late toxicities in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients treated with radiation therapy (RT).,"5507 Background: Genetic variation may partly explain differences in normal tissue toxicities after RT; yet no clear picture has emerged from RT toxicity studies of common GSV in candidate genes. In a large cohort of HNC patients treated with RT, we assessed whether 8 GSV, systematically selected from published sources, predicted acute or late RT toxicity,: TP53 rs1042522; ERCC4 rs1799801; ERCC2 rs1799793; ERCC2 rs13181; XRCC1 rs25487; XRCC3 rs861539 ; GSTM1 deletion; GSTT1 deletion.


METHODS
In a secondary analysis of a randomized trial of vitamin E supplementation in 540 stage I-II HNC patients treated with RT, RT toxicities were assessed using RTOG Acute Radiation Morbidity Criteria (during RT, 1 month after RT) and RTOG/EORTC Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme (at 6, 12 months after RT). The most severe time and tissue-specific RT toxicity, graded 0-4, was taken as an overall measure of acute/late toxicity. All 8 GSV were genotyped from blood leucocyte derived DNA. Ordinal logistic regression estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for toxicity, adjusted for known toxicity predictors in multivariate models. The false discovery rate (FDR) due to multiple testing was taken into account.


RESULTS
As crude and adjusted ORs associated with GSV were similar, we controlled for FDR by adjusting the p-values associated with the crude ORs. For late toxicity, no statistically significant association was observed with any of the 8 GSV. For acute toxicity, one statistically significant association was observed: The OR of acute toxicity was 1.43 (CI: 1.11-1.85) for the XRCC3 rs861539 (Thr241Met). XRCC3 (X-Ray repair, complementing defective, in Chinese Hamster 3) is part of a BRCA2-FANCD2-FANCG complex that promotes homologous recombination and interacts with rad51.


CONCLUSIONS
In our study, the rare allele of XRCC3 rs861539 was associated with increased acute RT toxicity, but not late toxicity. Previous studies of this SNP only assessed late toxicity, fibrosis or telangiectasia, with no clear results. Though results are promising, our study also underlines the limitations of the candidate gene approach to identify GSV that could predict RT toxicities.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""FranÃ§ois Meyer"", ids = ""144730481""); list(name = ""Isabelle Bairati"", ids = ""6394607""); list(name = ""Wei Xu"", ids = ""50232403""); list(name = ""Abul Kalam Azad"", ids = ""153207775""); list(name = ""Geoffrey Liu"", ids = ""19192156"")",,,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,29 15_suppl,5507

A surrogate biomarker profile is needed to distinguish between low-grade and high-grade cancers to help clinicians administer or avoid additional therapy. This study aimed to investigate molecular determinants of low-grade luminal breast cancers from a biomarker database. Methods 214 biomarkers from a well-annotated series of 1845 primary breast cancers were analysed for correlations with grade of breast cancer. Proteins with significant associations with grade 1 ER-positive cases (n=388) versus high-grade ER-positive cases (n=1183) were interrogated for pathway enrichment analysis (corrected for false discovery rate), with the STRING 10 platform (open access web-resource) incorporating Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG. Findings Univariate analysis (p range=0Â·041â€“0Â·0001) identified 28 markers with significant association for grade 1 ER-positive tumours (eg, androgen receptor [AR], FHIT, FOXA1) and 54 with a significant negative association (eg, PTEN, GATA3, KAPNA1, p53). Pathways unifying the positively associated proteins in low-grade breast cancers revealed enrichments in intracellular steroid hormone receptor signalling (p=0Â·003), mammary gland development (p=0Â·008), AR binding (p=0Â·017) (GO). For negatively associated proteins, significant enrichments included cell proliferation (p=0Â·0002), radiation response (p=0Â·0003), T cell differentiation (p=0Â·004), and double-strand break repair (p=0Â·0004) (GO), and the HIF1Î± (p=0Â·00003), p53 (p=0Â·0016), ErbB (p=0Â·002), and JAK-STAT (p=0Â·01) (KEGG) pathways. Interpretation These preliminary findings are the first, to our knowledge, to unify biomarkers for grade-related analysis in breast cancer, with use of protein based data. Within the constraints of selection bias, data mining from immunohistochemistry of multiple biomarkers in relation to the features and behaviour of breast cancer hold promise.

1b7917d784b040425bd4809adc1ee3547650f632,Shared variants for osteoporosis and T2DM,"epidemiological evidence has suggested that there is an association between osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2Dm); however, the mechanisms underlying this association have been unclear. Now, new research has identified genetic variants that could account for the link between osteoporosis and T2Dm. â€œAn important task and challenge is to perform a systematic search for shared genetic loci influencing these two diseases,â€ explains Hong-Wen Deng. â€œWe applied the pleiotropic conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method to two sets of data from genome-wide association studies to identify novel variants with pleiotropic effects on femoral BmD and T2Dm.â€ The analysis included 53,236 participants with data on femoral neck BmD and 159,208 participants with data on T2Dm. The researchers identified 27 SNPs associated with femoral neck BmD and 61 SNPs associated with T2Dm. of these SNPs, four were shared between femoral neck BmD and T2Dm, indicating that they could be pleiotropic. one of these SNPs was located in PLEKHA1; further analysis revealed that this gene is differentially expressed between patients with high versus low BmD and between patients with or without T2Dm. Weighted gene co-expression analyses also showed that PLEKHA1 is associated with multiple genes that are known to be involved in osteoporosis or T2Dm. â€œour study highlights PLEKHA1 as an important potentially pleiotropic gene,â€ says Deng. PleKHA1 is involved in regulating phosphorylation, which in turn regulates a range of cellular processes, including insulin sensitivity and bone mineralization. â€œTherefore, PleKHA1 might participate in bone and T2Dm metabolism,â€ concludes Deng. The researchers hope that future studies will build on these findings, including exploring the role of PleKHA1 in osteoporosis and T2Dm in more detail. The authors also note that their findings need to be validated. Claire Greenhill G E N E t I c S",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Claire J.

Thirty texture features were derived from each manually contoured T2-weighted, transaxial, prostatic TZ using texture analysis software that applies a spatial band-pass filter and quantifies texture through histogram analysis. Texture features of the TZ were compared to PSMA expression on the corresponding PET images. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction controlled the false discovery rate at <5%.ResultsEighty-eight T2-weighted images in 18 patients demonstrated abnormal PSMA expression within the TZ on PET-MR. 123 images were PSMA negative. Based on the corrected p-value of 0.005, significant differences between PSMA positive and negative slices were found for 16 texture parameters: Standard deviation and mean of positive pixels for all spatial filters (pâ€‰=â€‰<0.0001 for both at all spatial scaling factor (SSF) values) and mean intensity following filtration for SSF 3â€“6Â mm (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0002â€“0.0018).ConclusionAbnormal expression of PSMA within the TZ is associated with altered texture on T2-weighted MR, providing validation of MRTA for the detection of TZ prostate cancer.Key Pointsâ€¢ Prostate transition zone (TZ) MR texture analysis may assist in prostate cancer detection.â€¢ Abnormal transition zone PSMA expression correlates with altered texture on T2-weighted MR.â€¢ TZ with abnormal PSMA expression demonstrates significantly reduced MI, SD and MPP.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Anthony Bates"", ids = ""144882676""); list(name = ""Kenneth Alan Miles"", ids = ""145645048"")",a28d90f93fdddfb4a2a67308975c8ea9c87c370d; 54cc1ab449be8d49f3b36a3d9abbab9b9760e063; c91dbd927ec29ae97372831110145ef2a92a881c; e99e8ab379e5e6f79017172f9fe52bb158303a85; ecec050089883046c0d37ab3103cedc3aecf04d2; a95768de87b4f9eab99c291c3507722ccf4f3896; 97a935c91889cdd5c9d47cb34041b02c310fbd88; 27244a3c55084af4aa33d7a41b6eac202a59b7b6; c3ba0e484c7bcce7c30eb6b4b272950a98d6427b; 7426781195f7180c6e5260f4da6d37c5c2944669,a5c9bd48f8b5fd47f879767d6bddc961f4eaccd3; e6e216cf0ac675af64e4a8b4dbbc0af9e1fcec28; d830afc0ae4681d3713c9ef76a19037d6b6c6236; c436851fd97c73204dd01003c4efa52106d0536a; f20bf69cbd0b37ccda2c29901439b88aa79fe5bc; 71dc285a4562efee46dbb5c29f8473293f54f836; 6d8185e426623b5c2cb945095096dfdfaefe9e88; e0649116628c85b35e91b148d47c88d334d9eb37; a41fee5d893012694755456c3ad331f4b32f8c20; 3640663a397dbdf340c10aa95d98a04457422637,European Radiology,27,5290-5298

To approach the mechanisms of therapy resistance, we addressed genome-wide gene expression in blasts persisting after one week of induction therapy (day 8 blasts) and their molecular signatures as compared with blast cells at initial diagnosis (day 0 blasts). In order to approach this issue experimentally, a procedure has been established including flow sorting of leukemic blasts by their leukemia-associated immunophenotype and preparation of cRNA, starting from a small number of cells. Blast cells from 12 patients with precursor B-cell ALL were investigated using Affymetrix HG U133A microarrays, and genes commonly up- or down-regulated in blast cells under therapy were identified in matched pairs of day 8 and day 0 samples. In spite of the heterogeneous clinical features of the patients (mean rate of cytoreduction after 7 days of initial therapy = 82%, range between 33% and 99%), we were able to determine a set of 310 genes whose expression was commonly changed between day 8 and day 0 with an estimated false discovery rate of 0.05. The identified set of genes indicated inhibited cell cycling, reduced metabolism, and expression changes of multiple factors related to B-cell differentiation. These changes collectively suggested that gene expression in day 8 blasts is shifted towards resting mature B cells. To test this hypothesis, we isolated normal B cells from peripheral blood samples of leukemic patients and compared their gene expression to that of leukemic blasts using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA revealed that day 8 samples are positioned between day 0 samples and normal B-cell samples, and statistical significance of this observation could be established using the Jonckheere-Terpstra test. Changes of B-cell differentiation markers on protein level supported this finding. In addition, we analyzed all genes with regard to the correlation of their expression changes with the rates of cytoreduction in peripheral blood. We observed differential impairment of the key components of the translational machinery including ribosome, eukaryotic 43S preinitiation complex and eukaryotic 48S initiation complex. Overall, expression levels of these factors decreased in therapy-sensitive patients but did not change in therapy-resistant patients. Taken together, investigation of leukemia cells persisting during therapy identifies common and individual expression changes which may potentially affect sensitivity towards anti-leukemic agents and offers new insights into the mechanisms of therapy resistance in ALL.",2005,Biology,"list(name = ""Peter Rhein"", ids = ""2184125""); list(name = ""Stefanie Scheid"", ids = ""2179040""); list(name = ""Richard Ratei"", ids = ""2864648""); list(name = ""Christian Hagemeier"", ids = ""5018679""); list(name = ""Karl Dr. Seeger"", ids = ""46932169""); list(name = ""Renate Kirschner-Schwabe"", ids = ""1384082505""); list(name = ""Martin Schrappe"", ids = ""49944905""); list(name = ""Rainer Spang"", ids = ""48692032""); list(name = ""W. -D.

395b712bbb4100b990d5c1bf3362c274e561a942,Connectivity-based change point detection for large-size functional networks,"Recent understanding that the brain at rest does not remain in a single state but transiently visits multiple states emphasizes the importance of state changes embedded in the brain network. Due to the effectiveness of larger networks in characterizing brain states, there is an increasing need for a network-based change point detection method that is applicable to large-size networks, particularly those with longer time series. This paper presents a fast and efficient method for detecting change points in the large-size functional networks of resting-state fMRI. To detect change points, a statistic for the covariance change at each time point is tested by a local false discovery rate, estimated based on the empirical null principle using a semiparametric mixture model. We present simulations and empirical analyses of task-based and resting-state fMRI data sets with various network sizes up to 300 nodes selected from the Human Connectome Project database. We demonstrate that the proposed method is not only efficient in detecting change points in large samples of large-size networks but also is less sensitive to the window size selection and provides the consequent identification of the changed edges. The covariance-based change point detection method in this study would be very useful in exploring characteristics of dynamic states in long-term large-size resting-state brain networks.",2016,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Seok-Oh Jeong"", ids = ""2378838""); list(name = ""Chongwon Pae"", ids = ""8414445""); list(name = ""Hae-Jeong Park"", ids = ""145272829"")",d755b767bf4ccdd7a5ebbf9be56a51c29269c1b3; dd12d59176bd4bba33b152a25dba2b55d035adb2; e7b3b7248f1d1991776ecf1641c2e9f9d0b2cf15; 8de4320496dc4092c3253ade3212b67b3a3e5c5b; dc808c2efcf4d585f3356a5e7de62b9ec300bd03; 37e1f9a091ed1938449aafc27432603e3ac30bee; e2142f7b26510a51245dfc20f47a8746d5cd7c77; ce69cc6d9d6b50933c3bfa8b175baa0cf9f958d1; eedf30fe1503f138ad7ef9062befc1cc79baea60; 0c6cc0ad9a570dc2c39c726425ade18a3ed40199; 600a516703a5be307918fcb475a7d8bceb8886a4; 23f5eb9d4cdcc24fc9cbbe3249eaab2c50bdbc91; 1bcec921ecfd18990f939f018a983a621915f2bc; 5a7c6e9f7e5977c70cbac62a40577ced6cba2c8d; b583ad7253fa8c0c4b7ad9165632829937cf5a07,db7bde56b6f070e2f2b23e957f48551b4b53d7d3; 114ee0eaf93b97a2c32cd9c65fba7c47e0f8988e; c77382a74abbbe55075d96204f0bf178d7731058; 2aa980703e275536feaf27afaf13554a313d89af; 2f689cfa8ce23efa836ca0e9a5da2449bb06e085; 149d74f6570d75ec3278110ca3e6a6423a357ad9; 360464d7fca9b61cd0ffdd957196a87f1c3ce702; 8ca5820081f8c3a85b8125148124238d6d7d8c77; d2b3d25ceb2379709e1e8d616bab0be99457d1ce; c5e3d1886f8b81289fd746038d85b2375c1ee883; 134a5498f65a620de30ded88c520747fbaac5168; 5966e849916c0bb27f70e307c9e09957d9039780; 25055b228f68ac005752e44bfb61c3f6de365a9c; 77fe2c83f6b916e76f34af30bf406e1b509a68aa; ff9f8db8f7080d5d82506e47945e455582db29e6; 90ef5e3ffdd9756e6cfac743eac615baa4be511b; 5d7e514d45141178fc1061bd18f1102d8318a8c3; 5a983551a752b786892c042ae415be4b3d585580; e52ec01b318327d092486484b8ac8ae0f97534fe; a3f132288f4797236098766cb2893b5d3afe69f6; 5eee60ed2345954d8e97bca6aac28fd726312bae; 6f7c4b5dba6e92339fae4c92ceb81d93c191b4bc; b156a77276a4fffe7b17e32cdde05d1319374c29; e453605ea0e67459512e606a93219c4eb009f9e4; 0570ff70c04664c88a57598ec811264570912e2e; cb3efcd5de509f156420976977187a6311d12b6c; 728a63e35bda99d0bc6dbf4b44c4d33f36ac086b; c5725b2734f429899aa8193728eca749d256946b; 684f27093d91cd5c95acdc07a500b37b6843ea66; 8935522a06065d38f204caaa4e4de42ebab62b97; 58eafb31d15956e14f8f1e5778518860f31fc795; 347d8e55ef632c972f27aac096563d2774faa246; e7cf4a9762ee05fd9198b47241e8d98722c29024; baa7d667689ae703218742ef5d180b028dfb66e9; 2151cbe815393e502fd580e81877197eaf016494; 01de37b0032a973b87d2f636de3561f77dada7ad; 93b12062fc20d47c46564ed4f8ee1b48d1ea1d2b; 4374f32898e4e6fc52691bb99722f396d855d314; d7c7b5c1fa35514f860f9103e71b4f6594b27628; b78ecd9592a11b52f57177c5838925891ac74411; 693a6e46be9b613ac5beab7313e1f0b51658dbe9; 225a4e606ea6117e9f87b9e68bb5210a5c623e3d; ad4e281293237bdb8efbbd639ac823536815f42b; e0783f34937794275e35a254acd04c16c924be12; 489cab05fcaab2c2f5e00a14c4a580d1196c577b; 3c39636a812fc04d3bed7104958fb75b12f33cb4; 9fadfe86fca3e3133b09c913104bb79274e6b75d; 3a9413a07422f022094bafc6a5637a6c9aaa3d5a,NeuroImage,143,353-363
57bc5b3dee985e16d54c25365e3636f23ed0d500,Googling Stroke ASPECTS to Determine Disability: Exploratory Analysis from VISTA-Acute Collaboration,"The summed Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is useful for predicting stroke outcome. The anatomical information in the CT template is rarely used for this purpose because traditional regression methods are not adept at handling collinearity (relatedness) among brain regions. While penalized logistic regression (PLR) can handle collinearity, it does not provide an intuitive understanding of the interaction among network structures in a way that eigenvector method such as PageRank can (used in Google search engine). In this exploratory analysis we applied graph theoretical analysis to explore the relationship among ASPECTS regions with respect to disability outcome. The Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA) was searched for patients who had infarct in at least one ASPECTS region (ASPECTS â‰¤ 9, ASPECTS = 10 were excluded), and disability (modified Rankin score/mRS). A directed graph was created from a cross correlation matrix (thresholded at false discovery rate of 0.01) of the ASPECTS regions and demographic variables and disability (mRS > 2). We estimated the network-based importance of each ASPECTS region by comparing PageRank and node strength measures. These results were compared with those from PLR. There were 185 subjects, average age 67.5 Â± 12.8 years (55% Males). Model 1: demographic variables having no direct connection with disability, the highest PageRank was M2 (0.225, bootstrap 95% CI 0.215-0.347). Model 2: demographic variables having direct connection with disability, the highest PageRank were M2 (0.205, bootstrap 95% CI 0.194-0.367) and M5 (0.125, bootstrap 95% CI 0.096-0.204).

deb2a004a6ef483c3b23b46083273e621e98c052,A windowed local fdr estimator providing higher resolution and robust thresholds,"Motivation: In microarray analysis, special consideration must be given to the issues of multiple statistical tests and typically p-values are adjusted to control family-wise error rate (FWER) or false discovery rate (FDR). FDR metrics have been suggested for controlling false positives, however, genes with p-values close to the threshold typically have a higher chance of being false positives than genes with very low p-values. The local FDR (fdr) metric gives the number of false positives in the vicinity of a test statistic. We propose a new fdr estimator that uses windows instead of binsand define heuristics that use the fluctuations in the estimator to determine robust thresholds for classifying differential expression. 
Results: Our fdr approach estimates the false discovery rate within a window of p-values. We present heuristics that derive robust fdr thresholds such that a significant change in the fdr threshold yields a small change in the number of rejected hypotheses. We compare these thresholds with thresholds from other approaches using two simulated datasets and one cancer microarray dataset. In the latter, our estimator finds two robust thresholds. Since our fdr estimator is an extension of the FDR metric, it can be used with many FDR estimation methods.

28bd163ca11ffd0296c24f3927a8aab2b0d07bfb,Differential methylation in visceral adipose tissue of obese men discordant for metabolic disturbances.,"Obesity is associated with an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The severely obese population is heterogeneous regarding CVD risk profile. Our objective was to identify metabolic pathways potentially associated with development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) through an analysis of overrepresented pathways from differentially methylated genes between severely obese men with (MetS+) and without (MetS-) the MetS. Genome-wide quantitative DNA methylation analysis in VAT of severely obese men was carried out using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Differences in methylation levels between MetS+ (n = 7) and MetS- (n = 7) groups were tested. Overrepresented pathways from the list of differentially methylated genes were identified and visualized with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis system. Differential methylation analysis between MetS+ and MetS- groups identified 8,578 methylation probes (3,258 annotated genes) with significant differences in methylation levels (false discovery rate-corrected DiffScore â‰¥ |13| âˆ¼ P â‰¤ 0.05). Pathway analysis from differentially methylated genes identified 41 overrepresented (P â‰¤ 0.05) pathways. The most overrepresented pathways were related to structural components of the cell membrane, inflammation and immunity and cell cycle regulation. This study provides potential targets associated with adipose tissue dysfunction and development of the MetS.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""FrÃ©dÃ©ric GuÃ©nard"", ids = ""4215417""); list(name = ""AndrÃ© Tchernof"", ids = ""2960424""); list(name = ""Yves Deshaies"", ids = ""6338616""); list(name = ""Louis PÃ©russe"", ids = ""4776997""); list(name = ""Simon Biron"", ids = ""6561359""); list(name = ""Odette Lescelleur"", ids = ""4414362""); list(name = ""Laurent Biertho"", ids = ""47071185""); list(name = ""Simon Marceau"", ids = ""5599041""); list(name = ""Marie-Claude Vohl"", ids = ""119671034"")",dcfda4e8c9e41485cbc428bfa0563c7d1edd96ed; 3b20623c80bc03c65593be74d503bf0b1530cbe6; 97a106c82b1d15874137efd074523c0bf1d52280; 227f28f10be0ab77f59573484d03ec023c576646; e92c2da3679d11f6cc52dc5533547007be00ff48; 16f7d359d88d29b41bdbec488e45515cfb33cbee; 3ad644bf3d062b3d4b48a5d87695298bf68f7f0d; 21072bbe899701063251625dca6c8d498891e690; e0c64b34f95974280e521663e35163f77091acee; 7f63ef8760741bd41125b9978bb6a170acb18dc7; 4f137115edeb1bc7e3b6e2bb95b41e1363389be7; e4a86bcee28972af0b7eb7efd715be19ddc894cf; 4335b9eba95027d4d6aed92afa10101054010964; 90973abb4cbe8b5fb7971c4a27ef6a046c6966de; 15e56c38e9d16c09ac856dfa67a88283254e4258; 31eb19d5a4b46883961a42d423a71363022817e1; ef1dd00a7383fd993a6b81f9acd69b21ee67755d; ed89ff2d7a6796d3eed7f3245384b8ce278743df; af5ed7b65c6a1011460627aa3808b4027395e373; 15ffea5dc66a5fc32abbcb97b4fe69dbf8fcdaa3; f7d163046bacb61faeb370fc3a13fa79989e7e71; d39dd7f7d10a11c30d9de61f4d35d2bb8908d9c0; dfb95e2af420f98944e9cba23f638ed0b59f8fce; 7c17147b1ce9b2752c199acd3ccd3921f922bb6a; b8055921b14c3a9b83d0a3b4ea48031ecc5c4377; 5de22f540fa78d4c1767c6a1d29946b334285f53; 0fa87b6c8424d7553c6f21cf140e44b8219689b3; c61c6487d0bab42e484c512768f79df7238dff7c,6ccf07d71ae729d5d0bea9abed2c6f59b8a989e8; d8bb73b45df89dca95b7d6d71708809aadff54ab; d65e9e8625060ab15ffc7d5140ab9cc9587cbb17; d2674e93d5909a9a098295df9d49f6a67830f5b8; deddc41924691001b0a7b04555a47b3d6d7b2679; 2564ec457db247d9c5b4de5f2b56b5bd8ac5bf76; eff472db202273074984ebc418d6b18870e8614a; c897e61280d0d702d0e9e96e0a36546461be879c; 23b0257fa4012404279152b8e2348e4da0a4f472; c7e6d7b8733bf66072db0c20fdac5dfdf95eee23; 4d41a35ccbc7d89052a0ce0393818f9ecc04aa38; 2d598249b2bf2f5b8c5cb98e6208146dacdc1406; 450feaa9c0e8c4bc304a7c9ec1c7e2eecc1df787; 8ce55f10128b23308e98d97ead28af85fa78bc51; 501eeea0f66e4ec5e9b2bd39492e0c63f800bdb3; 70d71649eaf1a6b1aea4d365b8dc2b684c3b484f; 1f86f4e70bc364f9d6bb29c8dd5569aca3ad178a; 8506038975386e64f2f37fbdc00c0867329ecc08; 8e2ac3dd347ae075a7ade0de3a8057e7a26d2f81; 35e20637ee2097ed82254b3d96ea9339b375e3f8; a6e7692f3677865f5e7f0f5a229bee2b5eaa2792; 819c6ba76809432accdda0c060fae97cf291ac1e; d888e90019d4a9beff027f9621546551c08270ae; e4027ae268c060902221784445c4bf02573a97b0; d69c41c5d97c452b27168e1656aeb65d79765828; 1fda0f889b040edf5ad15501e65d95dd66ca341e; 2065b938af6fd995acdbecaad5e2b6d90a994ec3; 31eaa359d1f75370329a41c1dfb13e584d02a236; 350b71bfdbcb861024aa017243603641ece68536; 3a52dee24ce2da1e01c4ae709ed0d5b6e51082fc; 322c4985b068c395f1069492e3a5766fcb467418; c7d683be2bef4a35eee10e9ca5845d15c2eeecac; eda1c46aa022a976e712d492a9331395ba9ab514; 949220febedfa855835212bbcfe305473ec7a17c; 690651990d78bf058595b36011fda5a52bcd34fc; 260546b6a184aba884660126188ef2cc11bd5df3; d75052634fe13c350a72c1fc388c8b95296dd9fb; 1ae004fc91abbab51c65a66a14d378043a2df609; 7b18b0561f08f118d93acf001bdf4b5d9426f3eb; 2c914f3d0b5552f1f7f100719ed57ff5c2627a76,Physiological genomics,46 6,"

db1bd187dfe7e01912ba47fc2ea0fdd840703a44,"Protein Domain Prediction Using Context Statistics, the False Discovery Rate, and Comparative Genomics, with Application to Plasmodium Falciparum","Protein domain prediction is a key step in characterizing protein structure, function, and evolution. However, the genome of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malignant malaria, remains poorly-annotated using standard approaches to domain prediction. We identified several general problems with domain prediction and developed novel solutions. Firstly, existing domain recognition methods typically evaluate each domain prediction independently of the rest. However, the majority of proteins are multidomain, and pairwise domain cooccurrences are highly specific and non-transitive. Our novel solution, Domain Prediction Using Context (dPUC), successfully harnesses domain co-occurrence to predict weak domains that appear in previously observed combinations, while penalizing domain combinations that have never been observed. Secondly, although the E-value has been the dominant statistic for protein sequence analysis for the past two decades, domain prediction is a multiple hypothesis testing problem and lends itself to the use of q-values, which control the false discovery rate. We develop the first q-value algorithm for domain prediction and introduce several techniques to effectively address the challenges that arise in this application. Follow-up work introduces methods that combine the strengths of dPUC and q-values. All approaches are carefully benchmarked and greatly improve domain prediction compared to standard methods over individual organisms and on a large unbiased and non-redundant database of proteins. Thirdly, domain databases remain incomplete and unsupervised novel domain discovery remains a challenge. We introduce a novel domain discovery framework that takes advantage of advances in remote homology detection using HMM-HMM comparisons, as well as the wealth of information present in the genomes of P. falciparum and 14 of its closest relatives. Our sensitive compariii ative genomics approach yields 284 novel domain families that greatly increase coverage of proteins that were previously unannotated. In conclusion, our collection of novel techniques are freely available as source code, and are broadly applicable. We have demonstrated their utility in improving our knowledge of one of the most diverged and medically-relevant parasites.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Alejandro Ochoa"", ids = ""144168675"")",,7d51e21c1d6a42d3ac7bdd61820883baedaa1f55;

Although hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a well-established first-line antihypertensive in the United States, <50% of HCTZ treated patients achieve blood pressure (BP) control. Thus, identifying biomarkers that could predict the BP response to HCTZ is critically important. In this study, we utilized metabolomics, genomics, and lipidomics to identify novel pathways and biomarkers associated with HCTZ BP response.


METHODS AND RESULTS
First, we conducted a pathway analysis for 13 metabolites we recently identified to be significantly associated with HCTZ BP response. From this analysis, we found the sphingolipid metabolic pathway as the most significant pathway (P=5.8E-05). Testing 78 variants, within 14 genes involved in the sphingolipid metabolic canonical pathway, with the BP response to HCTZ identified variant rs6078905, within the SPTLC3 gene, as a novel biomarker significantly associated with the BP response to HCTZ in whites (n=228). We found that rs6078905 C-allele carriers had a better BP response to HCTZ versus noncarriers (âˆ†SBP/âˆ†DBP: -11.4/-6.9 versus -6.8/-3.5Â mmÂ Hg; âˆ†SBP P=6.7E-04; âˆ†DBP P=4.8E-04). Additionally, in blacks (n=148), we found genetic signals in the SPTLC3 genomic region significantly associated with the BP response to HCTZ (P<0.05). Last, we observed that rs6078905 significantly affects the baseline level of 4 sphingomyelins (N24:2, N24:3, N16:1, and N22:1; false discovery rate <0.05), from which N24:2 sphingomyelin has a significant correlation with both HCTZ DBP-response (r=-0.42; P=7E-03) and SBP-response (r=-0.36; P=2E-02).


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides insight into potential pharmacometabolomic and genetic mechanisms underlying HCTZ BP response and suggests that SPTLC3 is a potential determinant of the BP response to HCTZ.

4e1aac2e46ea058bf1349bfb8044cf377954c37b,Anatomical insights into disrupted small-world networks in pediatric posttraumatic stress disorder: a diffusion tensor imaging tractography study,"Purpose: To use DTI and graph theory approaches to explore the brain structural connectome in pediatric posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Materials and Methods: This study was approved by the relevant research ethics committee, and all subjectsâ€™ parents/guardians provided informed consent. Twenty-four pediatric PTSD patients and 23 trauma-exposed non-PTSD controls were recruited after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. The structural connectome was constructed using diffusion tensor imaging tractography, by thresholding the mean fractional anisotropy of 90 brain regions to yield 90Ã—90 partial correlation matrixes. Graph theory analysis was used to examine the group-specific topological properties, and nonparametric permutation tests were used for group comparisons of topological metrics. Results: Both groups exhibited small-world topology. However, PTSD showed increase in the characteristic path length (Lp) (P=0.0248), and decrease in local efficiency (Eloc) (P=0.0498) and global efficiency (Eglob) (P=0.0274). Furthermore, PTSD showed reduced nodal centralities mainly in the default mode, salience, central executive and visual regions (P < 0.05, false discovery rate corrected). The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale score was negatively correlated with nodal efficiency of left superior parietal gyrus (P=0.043). Conclusion: The structural connectome showed a shift toward â€˜regularizationâ€™, providing a structural basis for functional alterations of pediatric PTSD. These abnormalities suggest that PTSD can be understood by examining the dysfunction of large-scale spatially distributed neural networks. Introduction Brain structure can be interpreted as an integrated network using concepts of graph theory which quantify the whole brain as a single graph, comprising nodes linked by edges (1). Specifically, the small-world network pattern, which seems to have evolved to mediate high-efficiency parallel information transfer (2), has been used to define pathology in psychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (3-5). PTSD is a traumaand stressor-related disorder characterized by four symptom clusters: re-experience, avoidance, negative cognitions and mood, and arousal (6). Pediatric PTSD is not uncommon, the prevalence among children (12â€“17 years) being 3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls (7). Childhood trauma is a severe stressor with multiple neurochemical and hormonal effects which can lead to lasting changes in brain structure and function (8). Children are particularly susceptible to PTSD (9), which may adversely influence brain development. Early interventions may help prevent brain changes. Most early structural neuroimaging studies investigating the impact of childhood trauma on white matter (WM) integrity in children (10, 11) used manual tracing or volumetric morphometry. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has since emerged as a powerful technique to assess WM tracts by exploiting the diffusion of tissue water. Using DTI we identified whole-brain WM microstructural abnormalities in pediatric PTSD (12), but we did not explore the neurocircuitry directly using connectivity analyses. We also applied graph theory to functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, finding that the functional connectome in pediatric PTSD is shifted toward â€˜regularizationâ€™ (from a small-world to a more regular network) (4). As functional interaction is constrained by brain cortical anatomy (13), to fully understand function one must study its structural substrate directly. Based on our findings in the functional connectome (4), we hypothesized that in pediatric PTSD the structural connectome would show a similarly disrupted topological organization. Our purpose was to use DTI and graph theory approaches to explore the brain structural connectome in pediatric posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Materials and Methods Participants This study was approved by the local research ethics committee. Each childâ€™s parent/guardian was given a detailed information sheet, and then gave written consent. A total of 4,200 earthquake survivors were screened by M.W. and X.W. 8-15 months after the 8.0 magnitude earthquake in Sichuan in May 2008. Each participant was interviewed and screened using the PTSD checklist (PCL) (14); those scoring >35 on PCL were given the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) (15) by a psychiatrist (L.L., 31 yearsâ€™ experience), of which those scoring >50 on CAPS were diagnosed with PTSD; those scoring <30 on PCL were considered non-PTSD trauma-exposed controls and were not assessed using CAPS (16). Inclusion criteria for all participants were: personal experience of the earthquake; personal witness of death, serious injury, or building collapse; age <18 years; IQ >80. This identified 161 PTSD patients and 99 trauma-exposed non-PTSD controls with similar demographic characteristics, lifestyle and earthquake experiences. Exclusion criteria were: psychiatric co-morbidities assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (17); history of psychiatric or neurological disorders (n=42); MRI contraindication (n=30); recent medication that might affect brain function (n=24); unavailability of key data (n=12); left-handedness (n=10); CAPS score >35 but <50 (n=8); history of or current brain injury (n=7). Twenty-eight drug-naÃ¯ve first-episode PTSD patients and 26 trauma-exposed non-PTSD controls underwent MRI scanning. Head-motion artifacts excluded data from 4 PTSD and 3 controls. MRI data from 24 PTSD and 23 controls went forward for analysis. We have reported elsewhere some other MR data from some of these subjects. In (4) we reported resting state functional MRI data of 24 PTSD and 24 controls: that work investigated the brain functional connectome, while our current work explores the brain structural connectome. In (12) we reported DTI data of 27 PTSD and 24 controls: that work investigated the microstructural networks using voxel-based analysis, while our current work explores the structural network directly using connectivity analyses. Data Acquisition MRI data were acquired on a 3T MRI system (EXCITE; General Electric) using a single-shot spin-echo echo planar image (SE-EPI) sequence, and included one high-resolution T1 scan and one DTI data scan. Foam padding was used to minimize head motion. A whole-brain high-resolution T1-weighted image was acquired using a sagittal three-dimensional spoiled gradient recall (SPGR) sequence with repetition time (TR) = 8.5 ms, echo time (TE) = 3.4 ms, inversion time (TI) = 400 ms, slice thickness = 1 mm, no inter-slice gap, 156 axial slices, matrix size = 256Ã—256, field of view (FOV) = 24Ã—24 cm and flip angle = 12Â°. The diffusion sensitizing gradients were applied along 15 non-collinear directions (b-value = 1000 s/mm) together with an acquisition without diffusion weighting (b = 0). Imaging parameters were TR = 12000 ms, TE = 71.6 ms, number of excitations (NEX) = 2, slice thickness = 3 mm, 50 slices, 128Ã—128 matrix and 24Ã—24 cm FOV. The protocol included susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) which will be analyzed in a future study and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences which were evaluated for clinical abnormalities by a neuroradiologist. A radiologist (L.S., with 3 years experience) evaluated and verified image quality. Data Pre-Processing and DTI-Based Structural Network Construction All the image preprocessing and analyses were implemented using a pipeline tool for diffusion MRI (PANDA) (18). We (X.S. and D.L.) extracted the fractional anisotropy (FA) map of each subject in 3 steps: BET (skull removal), eddy correct and DTIFIT (building diffusion tensor models). We then registered the FA maps with the FMRIB FA template in standard MNI space using nonlinear registration. The automated anatomic labeling atlas (90 regions) was used to define the nodes of the WM network. PANDA uses the procedure proposed by Gong et al (19). Briefly, each of the individual FA images in native space was co-registered to its corresponding T1-weighted image using an affine transformation. Then the transformed T1-weighted images were non-linearly registered to the MNI space. The inverse transformations were obtained to the above two steps to transform the automated anatomic labeling atlas from MNI space to DTI native space. Thus, the individual cerebrum in native space was divided into 90 nodes corresponding to the automated anatomic labeling atlas. Each node represents a region of the DTI-based structural brain network. Deterministic tractography was performed to reconstruct whole brain WM tracts using the Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking algorithm (20). A tract was terminated if the turn angle was >45Â° or the fiber entered a voxel with FA <0.2 (21). We defined the averaged FA of the linking fibers for each connection. For each individual, we generated a symmetric 90Ã—90 network matrix in which each row/column represents a brain node/region and each element represents the averaged FA of the linking fibers between nodes. Using the GRETNA toolbox we investigated the topological properties of brain networks at both the global and nodal level. The global level properties were of two kinds: small-world parameters [for definitions see (2)], including the clustering coefficient Cp, characteristic path length Lp [calculated as the harmonic mean distance between all possible pairs of regions to address the disconnected graphs dilemma(22)], normalized clustering coefficient Î³, normalized characteristic path length Î», and small-worldness Ïƒ; and network efficiency parameters [for definitions see (23)], including the local efficiency Eloc and global efficiency Eglob. The nodal level properties were the nodal degree, nodal efficiency, and nodal betweenness. For each network metric we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) over the sparsity range from S1 to Sn with an interval of Î”S, where S1 = 0.10, Sn = 0.34 and Î”S = 0.01. The AUC provides a summarized scalar for t",2016,,"list(name = ""Xueling Suo"", ids = ""17702880""); list(name = ""Du Lei"", ids = ""48894321""); list(name = ""Fuqin Chen"", ids = ""7243343""); list(name = ""Min Wu"", ids = ""153138955""); list(name = ""Lei Li"", ids = ""49193117""); list(name = ""Ling Sun"", ids = ""51474946""); list(name = ""Xiaoli Wei"", ids = ""123548030""); list(name = ""Hong-yan Zhu"", ids = ""38885170""); list(name = ""Lingjiang Li"", ids = ""35956010""); list(name = ""Graham J.

2cf0121c92d118a3bc1acdd63f6c9704309fe5e6,Effects of internal low-dose irradiation from 131I on gene expression in normal tissues in Balb/c mice,"BackgroundThe aim of this study was to investigate the global gene expression response of normal tissues following internal low absorbed dose irradiation of 131I.MethodsBalb/c mice were intravenously injected with 13 to 260 kBq of 131I and euthanized 24 h after injection. Kidneys, liver, lungs, and spleen were surgically removed. The absorbed dose to the tissues was 0.1 to 9.7 mGy. Total RNA was extracted, and Illumina MouseRef-8 Whole-Genome Expression BeadChips (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, USA) were used to compare the gene expression of the irradiated tissues to that of non-irradiated controls. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to determine differentially expressed transcripts and control for false discovery rate. Only transcripts with a modulation of 1.5-fold or higher, either positively or negatively regulated, were included in the analysis.ResultsThe number of transcripts affected ranged from 260 in the kidney cortex to 857 in the lungs. The majority of the affected transcripts were specific for the different absorbed doses delivered, and few transcripts were shared between the different tissues investigated. The response of the transcripts affected at all dose levels was generally found to be independent of dose, and only a few transcripts showed increasing or decreasing regulation with increasing absorbed dose. Few biological processes were affected at all absorbed dose levels studied or in all tissues studied. The types of biological processes affected were clearly tissue-dependent. Immune response was the only biological process affected in all tissues, and processes affected in more than three tissues were primarily associated with the response to stimuli and metabolism.ConclusionDespite the low absorbed doses delivered to the tissues investigated, a surprisingly strong response was observed. Affected biological processes were primarily associated with the normal function of the tissues, and only small deviations from the normal metabolic activity in the tissues were induced.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Emil SchÃ¼ler"", ids = ""39841072""); list(name = ""Toshima Z.

ae71e620e08a1e2ae0f79e151e6501811d347764,OC-048 The Use of Volatile Organic Compounds Emitted from Stool as a Biomarker for Colonic Neoplasia,"Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. The incidence has increased by 6% in the last decade and it is the third most common malignancy in the UK, accounting for approximately 15,000 deaths annually. The UK Bowel Cancer Screening Programme has demonstrated that detection of CRC at an earlier stage and identification of advanced pre-malignant adenomas can reduce cancer-associated mortality. We analysed the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from stool to assess their utility as a biomarker for colonic neoplasia. Methods Stool was collected from symptomatic patients referred for colonoscopy and those within the BCSP. SPME headspace extraction followed by GC-MS was performed, in order to identify VOCs. The outcome of colonoscopy was classified as no-neoplasia, adenomatous polyp(s) and cancer. Data analysis was performed in R, Stata and Metaboanalyst, utilising Studentâ€™s t test, Fisherâ€™s exact test, ANOVA, false discovery rate correction, PLS-DA, factor analysis and ROC analysis. Logistic regression modelling with 10 fold cross validation was used to test potential biomarkers. Results 137 patients were included, with a mean age of 64 yrs (range 22â€“85), 54% were males. 60 patients had no neoplasia, 56 adenomatous polyp/s and 21 had CRC. 162 VOCs were identified across all samples, mean number in no-neoplasia 58.1 and 55.2 in neoplastic group, p = 0.51. VOC analysis was able to differentiate those with higher risk neoplastic disease with the greatest confidence. When comparing those with cancer to no neoplasia PLS-DA demonstrated separation, compound A was significantly more abundant in the CRC samples (p = *VOCs referred to as Compound A, B, X and Y due to potential future IP. Conclusion VOC analysis has a superior diagnostic ability for the identification of colorectal adenocarcinoma, when compared to other faecal based biomarker, including those currently employed in UK population based screening.

837f44ad39ce92b45534fb4b4f1190280f013de3,Abstract 20932: Dynamic Regulation of Myocardial Long Noncoding RNAs in Human Heart Failure and Reverse Remodeling With Left Ventricular Assist Device Support,"Introduction: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression and have been implicated in various biological processes. Modulating lncRNA levels could be a plausible strategy for the treatment of heart failure (HF), however the specific lncRNAs responsible for cardiac reverse remodeling remain largely unknown. Hypothesis: Myocardial lncRNAs mediate reverse remodeling through cis -regulation of the neighboring mRNAs Methods: RNA sequencing was performed using total RNA isolated from failing human myocardium before (n=21) and after (n=12) left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation as well as from non-failing controls (n=5). Mapped reads for all GENCODE v26 lncRNAs were calculated. Differentially regulated mRNAs and lncRNAs were identified using a fold-change cut-off of 2 and a false discovery rate of 5%. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between lncRNA and neighboring mRNAs. Results: 81 incident HF and 47 reverse remodeling lncRNAs were identified (Figure 1A). 46 HF lncRNAs (56.8%) were normalized following LVAD support and showed reciprocal regulation in the pre- vs. post-LVAD myocardium (Figure 1B). Recovery lncRNAs included recently described Myheart (originating in the MYH7 locus) as well as novel lncRNAs (NPPA-AS1, RORB-AS1, lnc-TECRL). Majority of the antisense, intergenic, and intronic myocardial lncRNAs demonstrated a positive correlation with neighboring genes suggesting cis -regulation by lncRNAs during cardiac reverse remodeling (Figure 1C). Conclusions: Myocardial lncRNAs are dynamically regulated during myocardial remodeling (HF) and reverse remodeling with LVAD support. Mechanical unloading is accompanied by partial normalization of the pathological lncRNA signature. Further studies will determine mechanisms by which neighboring protein coding genes are regulated by lncRNAs in the failing human heart.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Xianghai Liao"", ids = ""7818939""); list(name = ""Rong Lu"", ids = ""144264920""); list(name = ""Autumn Clemons"", ids = ""39550090""); list(name = ""Raia A.

78727f00e005dcca361e077e3d19eac74e10b430,Enrichment strategies in glycomics-based lung cancer biomarker development.,"PURPOSE
There is a need to identify better glycan biomarkers for diagnosis, early detection, and treatment monitoring in lung cancer using biofluids such as blood. Biofluids are complex mixtures of proteins dominated by a few high abundance proteins that may not have specificity for lung cancer. Therefore, two methods for protein enrichment were evaluated; affinity capturing of IgG and enrichment of medium abundance proteins, thus allowing us to determine which method yields the best candidate glycan biomarkers for lung cancer.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
N-glycans isolated from plasma samples from 20 cases of lung adenocarcinoma and 20 matched controls were analyzed using nLC-PGC-chip-TOF-MS (where PGC is porous-graphitized carbon). N-glycan profiles were obtained for five different fractions: total plasma, isolated IgG, IgG-depleted plasma, and the bound and flow-through fractions of protein enrichment.


RESULTS
Four glycans differed significantly (false discovery rate, FDR < 0.05) between cases and controls in whole unfractionated plasma, while four other glycans differed significantly by cancer status in the IgG fraction. No significant glycan differences were observed in the other fractions.


CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
These results confirm that the N-glycan profile in plasma of lung cancer patients is different from healthy controls and appears to be dominated by alterations in relatively abundant proteins.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""L.

ae956084ba8bcad91289bccac8c8a3f902320843,Transcriptome Analysis of Apple Leaves in Response to Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha) Infection,"Apple (Malus Ã— domestica Borkh.) is one of the most important cultivated tree fruit crops worldwide. However, sustainable apple production is threatened by powdery mildew (PM) disease, which is caused by the obligate biotrophic fungus Podosphaera leucotricha. To gain insight into the molecular basis of the PM infection and disease progression, RNA-based transcriptional profiling (RNA-seq) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in apples following inoculation with P. leucotricha. Four RNA-seq libraries were constructed comprising a total of 214 Gb of high-quality sequence. 1177 DEGs (661 upregulated and 629 downregulated) have been identified according to the criteria of a ratio of infection/control fold change > 2, and a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.001. The majority of DEGs (815) were detected 12 h after inoculation, suggesting that this is an important time point in the response of the PM infection. Gene annotation analysis revealed that DEGs were predominately associated with biological processes, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, hormone signal transduction and plant-pathogen interactions. Genes activated by infection corresponded to transcription factors (e.g., AP2/ERF, MYB, WRKY and NAC) and synthesis of defense-related metabolites, including pathogenesis-related genes, glucosidase and dehydrin. Overall, the information obtained in this study enriches the resources available for research into the molecular-genetic mechanisms of the apple/powdery mildew interactions, and provides a theoretical basis for the development of new apple varieties with resistance to PM.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaomin Tian"", ids = ""49103198""); list(name = ""Li Zhang"", ids = ""50821036""); list(name = ""Shuaishuai Feng"", ids = ""19280487""); list(name = ""Zhengyang Zhao"", ids = ""48634350""); list(name = ""Xiping Wang"", ids = ""1765465""); list(name = ""Hua Gao"", ids = ""144039875"")",6b76d959b8a0644daf81b0375dd0fef794b81fed; 999b72885072ba7e809dca1d32825a308b46f488,0c45686419a4463f2a896ba5f84b7696a65fefd1; e2da7853d3ec3e8ae2da1fddd962dc509764ddab; 76d58dba1059d0282b5525dce31112aed6dddeb2; 984b4d3a3ff1196ff16f95f1062d4ebea5bd5678; eff5a378c79354b087b13c9c73e8be529895e162; 64782907634214858f28cc5f56ca210dfe0179e7; 4dd5845aca177809f48a36ab562823d54416dee3; 58a61f35bbf06e557d4d391e1a373b67d95cd9ad; f2f3fa28f86dc5ae9efdbb08cd8aaecc0bf7c26c; 49e84a0e09d9150372eeb2dea04066394465f8be; c966c93da4f861d43024067cadbd89e7332bab7c; 7cf278154d7bd0b5e0af8d80e127d6b5f5920235; 00fb1b1125238b65fa9f346745ad3d1cbc19f0df; da71c92f902671879ccf15c8f365703ce26669a7; 5b9c6a2785995d4aa944006b8b5d579aa4a39d96; b75c9516971fc73866ab6750215b6b1cf6bf6119; ab889c01ef70ad639f6cb8cf70263d664007d1a2; 63735c4532d596986d96ed20d756dcc87cd3b62e; 2d1d07a8b381a78e0df0a92cb6a44ff11dd11c3f; 51a4b837bdd32bc37fd5a3a8a95959f4770c44b0; 58a93e9cd60ce331606d31ebed62599a2b7db805; 8bc4ff3d1d0c219df32e52cc3409cc9be217747c; 13ceda93a3f46544d59fad1c22c6e07c03bf515a; 6b8e5893aa3ec65928903f71925fd263c4408d86; c05588953b54a146b2a107d611114c0f196eeece; b51d330f4a57e67b49edbf2eba12046fc9c10520; a97d42e14769260085d3c07a4885fe71731217c5; 07e5392c4e53a0cce00770f2de8d39ed6bf842c5; 9b387ae37a10e50a50e801ec3a4587ab608f4dfa; 9619e46fa5b675760acd15e30c951955ef73e0c0; 9152438dbbfb904fedb2ba6125790d4e52779e9e; c7626888c41952e91b8f3e2b418d5eaa23d10645; 788b43b7c62b497cf69b31544c6f81c6f4856d42; 16d4ba9cc1d46d452a40ba7faae870a1c4a36cc0; 67ae78d083d2cbe9f4e17f806a9f2aafe8b260c0; 5ae321030910c172161b6c39b2af92d4a31e7220; c9b7243dfe233af2696296e5c2ae953f7dfabdcd; 35f03921a48e03687333b9d275bf5e58bd2520b8; 33070d1e34d4938dea11be59f7bbe6c9d21674f4; a8a9f5be0e73bdabe4af4d8de4785f4b465e3738; 2baeec89e9a18cfdb509ad6aafb8ea7fd0962651; 159738308b6cd94265c875d583fabc1d4082ab0e; 20a043126d3eb88e6730384007457ad908137027; 276766a10ad74cba49ae00d4b398e3b960810b12; 993edcfeb91f062a2a512252369218dfcaaa6d24; 838afc48cd055ad15062364f2fabdb98b802120e; 0ff67ec6512307db65601057e947681554c7d011; 7cd3f916b3c275519539f0cd77f5b4c3e004c479; 6e46117f148bae6b3675dcd7d1be1ee5f4f0706d; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; 1fdd435e7b305602465a9d4ff4e04cc9f3f6f8ab; 6dcc90b8ea9e1560bafb1df7e7f88d3375c95505; 62f5ffb09a4c9543509c38f005b9c6eb308c6974; c7ab19f9fa61a21e04d8151be3fba41ca3595e8d; 8957c530706a03b1ea1e23fa725e5542fbfaeea9; d202a331d5f7b693ffa2ab70b528308553f332e7; 180b25d99892a5431057497f2f78806c5b57a699,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,20,
af26e9318390cfc58d98090e2383c5a7710253a6,Beyond comparisons of means: understanding changes in gene expression at the single-cell level,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be used to characterise differences in gene expression patterns between pre-specified populations of cells. Traditionally, differential expression tools are restricted to the study of changes in overall expression between cell populations. However, such analyses do not take full advantage of the rich information provided by scRNA-seq. In this article, we present a Bayesian hierarchical model which can be used to study changes in expression that lie beyond comparisons of means. In particular, our method can highlight genes that undergo changes in cell-to-cell heterogeneity between the populations but whose overall expression is preserved. Evidence supporting these changes is quantified using a probabilistic approach based on tail posterior probabilities, where a probability cut-off is calibrated through the expected false discovery rate. Our method incorporates a built-in normalisation strategy and quantifies technical artefacts by borrowing information from technical spike-in genes. Control experiments validate the performance of our approach. Finally, we compare expression patterns of mouse embryonic stem cells between different stages of the cell cycle, revealing substantial differences in cellular heterogeneity.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Catalina A.

51e220339f325e441ffb94d200c2e676bf0f9b28,Were genome-wide linkage studies a waste of time? Exploiting candidate regions within genome-wide association studies.,"A central issue in genome-wide association (GWA) studies is assessing statistical significance while adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing. An equally important question is the statistical efficiency of the GWA design as compared to the traditional sequential approach in which genome-wide linkage analysis is followed by region-wise association mapping. Nevertheless, GWA is becoming more popular due in part to cost efficiency: commercially available 1M chips are nearly as inexpensive as a custom-designed 10 K chip. It is becoming apparent, however, that most of the on-going GWA studies with 2,000-5,000 samples are in fact underpowered. As a means to improve power, we emphasize the importance of utilizing prior information such as results of previous linkage studies via a stratified false discovery rate (FDR) control. The essence of the stratified FDR control is to prioritize the genome and maintain power to interrogate candidate regions within the GWA study. These candidate regions can be defined as, but are by no means limited to, linkage-peak regions. Furthermore, we theoretically unify the stratified FDR approach and the weighted P-value method, and we show that stratified FDR can be formulated as a robust version of weighted FDR. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the methods in two GWA datasets: Type 2 diabetes (FUSION) and an on-going study of long-term diabetic complications (DCCT/EDIC). The methods are implemented as a user-friendly software package, SFDR. The same stratification framework can be readily applied to other type of studies, for example, using GWA results to improve the power of sequencing data analyses.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yun Joo Yoo"", ids = ""3152445""); list(name = ""Shelley B.

ae9e74cf8a2b4f3c0683c6f82b4aa295e0b47257,Characteristics of Resting-State Functional Connectivity in Intractable Unilateral Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients with Impaired Executive Control Function,"Executive control function (ECF) deficit is a common complication of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Characteristics of brain network connectivity in TLE with ECF dysfunction are still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate resting-state functional connectivity (FC) changes in patients with unilateral intractable TLE with impaired ECF. Forty right-handed patients with left TLE confirmed by comprehensive preoperative evaluation and postoperative pathological findings were enrolled. The patients were divided into normal ECF (G1) and decreased ECF (G2) groups according to whether they showed ECF impairment on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Twenty-three healthy volunteers were recruited as the healthy control (HC) group. All subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Group-information-guided independent component analysis (GIG-ICA) was performed to estimate resting-state networks (RSNs) for all subjects. General linear model (GLM) was employed to analyze intra-network FC (p < 0.05, false discovery rate, FDR correction) and inter-network FC (p < 0.05, Bonferroni correction) of RSN among three groups. Pearson correlations between FC and neuropsychological tests were also determined through partial correlation analysis (p < 0.05). Eleven meaningful RSNs were identified from 40 left TLE and 23 HC subjects. Comparison of intra-network FC of all 11 meaningful RSNs did not reveal significant difference among the three groups (p > 0.05, FDR correction). For inter-network analysis, G2 exhibited decreased FC between the executive control network (ECN) and default-mode network (DMN) when compared with G1 (p = 0.000, Bonferroni correction) and HC (p = 0.000, Bonferroni correction). G1 showed no significant difference of FC between ECN and DMN when compared with HC. Furthermore, FC between ECN and DMN had significant negative correlation with perseverative responses (RP), response errors (RE) and perseverative errors (RPE) and had significant positive correlation categories completed (CC) in both G1 and G2 (p < 0.05). No significant difference of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was found between G1 and G2, while intelligence quotient (IQ) testing showed significant difference between G1and G2.There was no correlation between FC and either MoCA or IQ performance. Our findings suggest that ECF impairment in unilateral TLE is not confined to the diseased temporal lobe. Decreased FC between DMN and ECN may be an important characteristic of RSN in intractable unilateral TLE.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chao Zhang"", ids = ""50445614""); list(name = ""Hongyu Yang"", ids = ""1787137""); list(name = ""Wen Qin"", ids = ""144804484""); list(name = ""Chang Liu"", ids = ""47535990""); list(name = ""Zhigang Qi"", ids = ""3480061""); list(name = ""Nan Chen"", ids = ""144598775""); list(name = ""Kuncheng Li"", ids = ""3188483"")",6246668b623a49ff225b1882e0eafcd2a705cb8f; 82b71f98cc8c66442ef2ae9d09b3fee4617c0e4d; 1058e58b0d914dfa0ff9bdae7da84a4655664471; f19c2d58c5ba42be27b9dc1795b2a3a2f30007c8; 9194026dd67b7e57f50730d15813510c7fcbe33a,2b65d861362e12a6f2ab7f3114fb1330a78f2823; f670b20be6442f72fe802fb194bbebbc7ba757f1; fc258f8fe22e3148fad8611a491a90e97d7f0957; 96bb51907cedad1d85bc061195f8e027e20e019c; 6f8fdff905cf6b4cc1ba1511399b8b297cc38db9; 2615723030615a05320254cec8c0df9d61a8ca1a; c5271f109e9fd7bf5d84b0e34f335f0e06c3d136; 423e9e29400a9f69cf7465fb6d7ae57d7870ff9a; 916dfafec0ced6c92abe2aedf4148d33ec3f1d3e; 627e791e1b72213ecbb8af496295f11d67771c02; 31cbab819bdcf7a7a1d128ee2711fb162c917faf; f742f4214155bbf708d603087ad7d1f52c96084f; 7e2ca96bf9477eb02d4f48e87e3835838162ab59; ae01ab13029729d00d5e651378616376952ae23d; df4375e6043b9cd0e8f03aabd0350353b44f386c; dfc951889706ce5143969fa4e37552eab65ac546; e437f8f4614708b047952a095f1c405429fe6c39; e7dee4691e9bf2b27ee2a29a675f03f113c9838c; f897751da2ccffe1d090cbae44061b3c1e8280a7; a32274f70c4df9becafc0a8dc5a354d67675fdbe; 0b55af3e802564aea51cceeae64a41ec381c6bc5; ed1ec39976595621acb513f3863733e9d13c3ae8; 49dd06582926a611febba5a2d29fdae6c7d2634b; 9e39b3034ced5c2ebc43522fd9d49a4c1471f39d; 0593bdd61fc1a60ede7e0a497da2bd8a875ef6c2; 052cef64f9c4c5cdf379e4313c34529ad07b0dc9; 0a04c261814c789d8f7dff434fe1c451f3aff894; ca9100bd89dfce0588a094da40ce50b6bf9c1b8e; f0f93d82f6d6dd3aa151acea75a7ab08a4774a0e; 29c7b2ff6c728034fc444df24da39ffebf35ea9e; eea43fbe1b2059f20249a4f9893a71ebb812ed2e; dddb6bde3d05c83e38342f8bf3ae6d23819e49c8; 9b12eb3cb7aff891e8ddbf7e811ed12bfd3981f2; 0b5b416316fccb00d7140736ee8c061dc8fa365a; bea184b76ba71578bb5b10d7373ab3c6f9aa9ccf; 9d8012ff3e450e7b35ce39e876dc898a2811921e; 4234c7c02180eb0f64ab16bd47aa91dbd0ac21f9; 66cedab15c294a206785ffc8e797dca66813c906; 24676f6108a8b1a481c1a63265693321fb2cf0d0; 64b4ef2fc5f0f48736df59f63a6a072d28e5a335; a1adc35d77c43b670ad1287b6bcf6669f0b1aaa2; ab9d1399c59336df8fb8637c6eb0eae0adf3672a; 13317deb433d4f2056f84dce6d37cbf9ec03a36c; bdca4176a6cc2d285605c439843ae42a4331e1f1; 809a9547ebfcd1270a0174d2f8612a9de9a26b25; ab53ea4abdd01d044aa582cc7d0f1a533da03a11; 693a6e46be9b613ac5beab7313e1f0b51658dbe9; b45dc384c42b9dcde475b6c4e0a8f81a025f1d61; 207d781cdf45bf51a8d1a14cc663375693fc1dd8; 9b9d8f6db6f98a0c3bbda249bac12c5f52e44ab6; 9d78b9228cd3222db540b2be7d1606b8cb0a17c0; c50d09d4aa849089fc0a2ea71bbe2a77c5e5a96e; 8e92bb3a0c274fcc077b75bfbdc5d17b80dcb4df; 83fc5cad58265667cf24edfd100f4c218590f329; 16941066ccbbe4ccaa793309a83bbd706eb983ef; 086a7d7e8315ce3d25e1a2a7a2602b1d2c60eb7a; b18a83a46a51efd3dabe4e1aacdac2d157760e04; a3f218f3689452a3664d9130980d37614cf97c29; 8935522a06065d38f204caaa4e4de42ebab62b97; 4dfdeb4b102daa3f32723fb71bbc1b09146d9f50; 14147a1e53fa964d1896c4cadf435a03e3833fde; f96f659ada20f35e9fce66306c8f8f6a471e592d; d2dab8098f35a2edd3709fa2bc1196b5ccccd45d; 042c8cc58ef53728b90deb0b65f612f3ab2c9414; dc338602a333281563b11a4f5d37b14a4cc1910a; 63c3efc312c17b68edf4132926a1926b4f392b50; 6121d8df395e4acfc26a5229422f21102474e1bd; 32205fc72c7148eae1b1119cdeb6ace832e90ee6; 48265726215736f7dd7ceccacac488422032397c; 73acdc6070053b4e8ed287c12cd9ac5d2e497420; 646e14fa0f734bfd8506a69422c122235fcfdff8; cd309ca6d59e8ddfc6f24933f1a56a4197e27bb1; be7ebce032a8af52e424f1b7b09c1cf4872cdf5e; ad7df36a6bb56b9097446d746579c281d2f7fd95; af895028e5746cd69fe9f95c9f02fb1aaf6a2202,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,11,
7c292870f37849ac1de284e8c228e97233ef8560,Association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and obesity in a Chinese rural population: The Henan Rural Cohort Study.,"Association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and obesity remains inconclusive, and the evidence from rural areas was limited. Thus, this study aimed to assess the association between ambient air pollution and obesity based on different anthropometric indices in Chinese rural adults, and further to compare the effect sizes of different air pollution types. A total of 38,824 participants (aged 18-79 years) were recruited from the Henan Rural Cohort Study. Logistic and multivariable linear regression model were used to examine the association between ambient air pollution exposure (including particulate matter with aerodynamic diametersÂ â‰¤Â 1.0Â Î¼m (PM1), â‰¤2.5Â Î¼m (PM2.5), and â‰¤10Â Î¼m (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) and obesity as well as obese anthropometric indices (including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), body fat percentage (BFP), and visceral fat index (VFI)). The potential effect modifications were also examined. Positive associations were found between long-term exposure to PM1, PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 and obesity regardless of how obesity was defined (false discovery rate (FDR)Â <Â 0.05). Moreover, BMI, WC, WHR, WHtR, BFP, and VFI displayed increased trends with PM1, PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 concentrations increasing (all FDR<0.05). PM10 had the largest effects on obesity among the four types of air pollution. The elderly, women, individuals with low level of education and income, and those who had high fat diet were more vulnerable to the adverse effects of air pollution. In addition, the results of the sensitivity analysis showed that those associations between ambient air pollution and obesity remained robust. These findings suggest that long-term exposure to ambient air pollutant (particularly PM10) may be positively associated with obesity in Chinese rural adults, especially among the elderly, women, individuals with low education and income, as well as unhealthy lifestyles.",2020,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaotian Liu"", ids = ""2294824""); list(name = ""Runqi Tu"", ids = ""12507487""); list(name = ""Dou Qiao"", ids = ""9259690""); list(name = ""Miaomiao Niu"", ids = ""49841352""); list(name = ""Ruiying Li"", ids = ""1390433427""); list(name = ""Zhen-xing Mao"", ids = ""11389227""); list(name = ""Wenqian Huo"", ids = ""3721898""); list(name = ""Gongbo Chen"", ids = ""6539464""); list(name = ""Hao Xiang"", ids = ""1869858""); list(name = ""Yuming Guo"", ids = ""1720884""); list(name = ""Shanshan Li"", ids = ""50341052""); list(name = ""Chongjian Wang"", ids = ""83291664"")",,,Environmental pollution,260,"

3ccfacc14cf1ac0cf3ea6c4d59697fbcd4df57e0,"Freshly isolated rat alveolar type I cells, type II cells, and cultured type II cells have distinct molecular phenotypes.","We used microarray analysis with Affymetrix rat chips to determine gene expression profiles of freshly isolated rat type I (TI) and TII cells and cultured TII cells. Our goals were 1) to describe molecular phenotypic ""fingerprints"" of TI and TII cells, 2) to gain insight into possible functional differences between the two cell types through differentially expressed genes, 3) to identify genes that might indicate potential functions of TI cells, since so little is known about this cell type, and 4) to ascertain the similarities and differences in gene expression between cultured TII cells and freshly isolated TI cells. For these experiments, we used preparations of isolated TI and TII cells that contained <2% cross-contamination. With a false discovery rate of 1%, 601 genes demonstrated over twofold different expression between TI and TII cells. Those genes with very high levels of differential expression may be useful as markers of cell phenotype and in generating novel hypotheses about functions of TI and TII cells. We found similar numbers of differentially expressed genes between freshly isolated TI or TII cells and cultured TII cells (698, 637 genes) and freshly isolated TI and TII cells (601 genes). Tests of sameness/difference including cluster dendrograms and log/log identity plots indicated major differences between the phenotypes of freshly isolated TI cell and cultured type II cell populations. The latter results suggest that experiments with TII cells cultured under these conditions should be interpreted with caution with respect to biological relevance to TI or TII cells.",2005,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Robert Fontecha GonzÃ¡lez"", ids = ""143924334""); list(name = ""Yee Hwa Yang"", ids = ""7607654""); list(name = ""Chandi A.

6b961a2444c8115f7f2376c0608ec39058678a5b,FRI0272 Analysis of molecular mechanism in igg4-related disease: comparison with sjÃ¶grenâ€™s syndrome,"Background IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a new disease entity characterized by high serum IgG4 levels, infiltration of IgG4-positive plasmacytes and fibrosis in various organs such as the pancreas, salivary and lacrimal glands. Although the clinical features have been clarified recently, the pathogenesis of this disease remains unclear [1]. We previously showed that significantly higher expressions of IL-10, TGFb, and AID in labial salivary glands (LSG) of IgG4-RD than Sjogrenâ€™s syndrome (SS) and controls. In LSG of IgG4-RD, increased IL-10 and TGFb might play pathogenic roles in IgG4-specific class switch recombination and fibrosis. AID also might contribute to up-regulation of IgG4-specific class switch recombination along with IL-10 in LSG [2]. Objectives The purpose of this study was to clarify the molecules which played pathogenic roles in IgG4-RD exhaustively. Methods 1) Gene expression was analyzed by DNA microarray using GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) in LSG of IgG4-RD (N=3) and SS (N=3). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in IgG4-RD and SS were identified, and gene-annotation enrichment analysis of these DEGs was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. 2) Validation of the result was performed by quantitative PCR using LSG from IgG4-RD (N=8), SS (N=11), and controls (N=3) other than the patients analyzed by DNA microarray. 3) We also examined the expression of molecules in protein level by immunofluorescence assay using lacrimal glands from patients with IgG4-RD. Results 1) Gene expression patterns in IgG4-RD and SS were quite different in hierarchical clustering. In IgG4-RD, 580 up-regulated and 280 down-regulated genes were identified as DEGs (false discovery rate 2) PCR validated significantly higher expression of CCL18 which related to chemotaxis and fibrosis, in LSG of IgG4-RD than in SS and controls (P 3) Immunofluorescence assay showed that CD68 positive macrophages could produce CCL18 in lacrimal glands of IgG4-RD. Conclusions DNA microarray analysis in this study showed that the gene expression pattern in LSG of IgG4-RD was different from that of SS, suggesting different pathogenic mechanisms of IgG4-RD and SS. CCL18 produced by macrophages might relate to the pathogenesis of IgG4-RD via the chemotaxis of T cells and B cells, and the induction of collagen production from fibroblasts.

48ae5a59d4246c374c11807a1906a8f908e39389,Statistical problems in DNA microarray data analysis,"Author(s): Wang, Nancy Naichao | Advisor(s): Speed, Terence P | Abstract: DNA microarrays are powerful tools for functional genomics studies. Each array contains thousands of microscopic spots of DNA oligonucleotides with specific sequences, which can hybridize with their complementary DNA sequences. Thus each microarray experiment consists of parallel assays about thousands of genomic fragments. This thesis concerns some statistical issues in the analysis of DNA microarray data.One common usage of DNA microarrays is to monitor the dynamic levels of gene expression in response to a stimulus. This is often achieved through a time course experiment, in which RNA samples are extracted at various time points after exposing the organism to the stimulus. A particularly interesting type of time course experiments involve replicated series of longitudinal samples. In 2006, Tai and Speed proposed a multivariate empirical Bayes model for analyzing this type of data. The MB-statistic derived from this model was shown useful for ranking the genes according to changes in their temporal expression profiles. In the first part of this thesis, we propose an empirical Bayes false discovery rate (FDR)-controlling procedure for multiple hypothesis testing using the MB-statistic. A null distribution is obtained using the parametric bootstrap. Critical values are determined according to the empirical Bayes FDR procedure. This method was compared, through simulations, to the frequentist FDR procedure, which requires a theoretical null distribution for calculating the nominal p-values. Although our method is slightly anti-conservative, it is more robust to the variability in the estimates of the hyperparameters, when the degree of moderation is small.Another common usage of DNA microarrays is to detect genomic locations that are associated with DNA-binding proteins. This is often achieved through ChIP-chip experiments that combine chromatin immunoprecipitation with the microarray technology. Traditional DNA microarrays designed for gene expression studies contain only a few probes for each gene. A special type of DNA microarrays, called tiling arrays, are often used in ChIP-chip experiments. They typically contain probes that are placed densely along the chromosomes to cover either the entire genome or contigs of the genome. A couple of challenges in the analysis of ChIP-chip tiling array data have not been met satisfactorily in the literature. When large scale genomic studies are carried over a long period of time, tiling arrays with different probe designs are often used for practical reasons. The first challenge is the integration of replicate experiments performed using different tiling array designs. When the biological process of interest involves a large protein complex, the investigators often perform ChIP-chip experiments on each component DNA-binding protein individually. DNA targets that are shared by the individual proteins are thought to be the localization sites of the protein complex. The second challenge is the joint analysis of multiple DNA-binding proteins, aimed at identifying their shared targets. In the second part of this thesis, we propose a nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model (HMM) for addressing these two challenges. The nonhomogeneous time axis represents the genomic positions of the probes. The hidden states represent the binding statuses of the proteins. The state-conditional emission distributions of the tiling array data are protein-specific and design-specific. We derived a modified Baum-Welch algorithm for fitting the model parameters. We also developed a procedure that converts the probe level summaries into peaks, which represent the putative binding sites, based on both signal strength and peak shape. To compare our method with existing methods, we curated a set of positive and negative genomic regions from a C. elegans dataset, and performed some receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses. When applied to each experiment separately, our method performs similarly as the three best existing methods. When applied to the combined data set, which consists of tiling arrays with different probe designs, our method shows a drastic improvement in performance. A generalization of the nonhomogeneous HMM enables the joint analysis of the ChIP-chip data of multiple proteins. We present an application of this method to identify the shared localization sites of two DNA-binding proteins, under two different conditions.",2009,Biology,"list(name = ""Nancy Wang"", ids = ""144068298"")",,,,,

Noninvasive assessment of PAD is performed by measuring the ankle-brachial index (ABI). Complex traits, such as ABI, are influenced by a large array of genetic and environmental factors and their interactions. We attempted to characterize the genetic architecture of ABI by examining the main and interactive effects of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and conventional risk factors.MethodsWe applied linear regression analysis to investigate the association of 435 SNPs in 112 positional and biological candidate genes with ABI and related physiological and biochemical traits in 1046 non-Hispanic white, hypertensive participants from the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study. The main effects of each SNP, as well as SNP-covariate and SNP-SNP interactions, were assessed to investigate how they contribute to the inter-individual variation in ABI. Multivariable linear regression models were then used to assess the joint contributions of the top SNP associations and interactions to ABI after adjustment for covariates. We reduced the chance of false positives by 1) correcting for multiple testing using the false discovery rate, 2) internal replication, and 3) four-fold cross-validation.ResultsWhen the results from these three procedures were combined, only two SNP main effects in NOS3, three SNP-covariate interactions (ADRB2 Gly 16 â€“ lipoprotein(a) and SLC4A5 â€“ diabetes interactions), and 25 SNP-SNP interactions (involving SNPs from 29 different genes) were significant, replicated, and cross-validated. Combining the top SNPs, risk factors, and their interactions into a model explained nearly 18% of variation in ABI in the sample. SNPs in six genes (ADD2, ATP6V1B1, PRKAR2B, SLC17A2, SLC22A3, and TGFB3) were also influencing triglycerides, C-reactive protein, homocysteine, and lipoprotein(a) levels.ConclusionWe found that candidate gene SNP main effects, SNP-covariate and SNP-SNP interactions contribute to the inter-individual variation in ABI, a marker of PAD. Our findings underscore the importance of conducting systematic investigations that consider context-dependent frameworks for developing a deeper understanding of the multidimensional genetic and environmental factors that contribute to complex diseases.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sharon L.

54eaf409a706946205449bc6cae8fb75df20920d,Nucleotide diversity and linkage disequilibrium of adaptive significant genes in Larix (Pinaceae),"Nucleotide polymorphism in genes potentially responsible for the adaptation to the latitudinal gradient of climate was investigated in the Siberian larch (Larix sibirica). The genes were selected among those previously studied in Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), the variability of which indicates the influence of selection or shows the association with phenotypic traits that are important for adaptation to low temperatures and to geographically heterogeneous environment. Nucleotide sequences of eight genes, including coding and noncoding regions, were amplified and sequenced using newly developed primers specific to Larix. The sample size was 123 megagametophytes per locus in L. sibirica and 16.2 in L. occidentalis, which was taken as the outgroup. The length of the sequenced fragments was 246â€“1700 bp. Nucleotide polymorphism Ï€ averaged 0.00536 (0.002â€“0.008), and haplotype diversity was Hd: 0.822 (0.625â€“0.948). Tajimaâ€™s D was negative in all fragments and significant in three, while statistics D* and F* was significant in three and four segments, respectively, and Fs was significant in three. This may indicate the presence of purifying selection on these genes or population growth. The HKA test revealed no significant deviations from the neutral model of evolution in all genes. The recombination parameter Ï/Î¸ = 0.28 was close to the value obtained from P. menziesii. To investigate the association of polymorphic sites (factor) in these eight genes to the latitude of investigated individuals (trait), the generalized linear model (GLM) was used taking into account the population structure. After false discovery rate (FDR) correction, no significant associations were found. The age of the split of American and Eurasian Larix lineages based on the nucleotide differences in the eight genes between L. sibirica and L. occidentalis is estimated to be 12 million years, which is much younger than the age of the most ancient Larix fossils.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Vladimir L.

We here conducted a cross-species network analysis of macrophage gene expression data between human and mouse to identify conserved networks across both species, and assessed whether such networks could reveal new disease-associated regulatory mechanisms. From a sample of 684 individuals processed for genome-wide macrophage gene expression profiling, we identified 27 groups of coexpressed genes (modules). Six modules were found preserved (P < 10-4) in macrophages from 86 mice of the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel. One of these modules was significantly [false discovery rate (FDR) = 8.9 Ã— 10-11] enriched for genes belonging to the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway. This pathway was also found significantly (FDR < 10-4) enriched in susceptibility genes for Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases. We further conducted an expression quantitative trait loci analysis to identify SNP that could regulate macrophage OXPHOS gene expression in humans. This analysis identified the PARK2 rs192804963 as a trans-acting variant influencing (minimal P-value = 4.3 Ã— 10-8) the expression of most OXPHOS genes in humans. Further experimental work demonstrated that PARK2 knockdown expression was associated with increased OXPHOS gene expression in THP1 human macrophages. This work provided strong new evidence that PARK2 participates to the regulatory networks associated with oxidative phosphorylation and suggested that PARK2 genetic variations could act as a trans regulator of OXPHOS gene macrophage expression in humans.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Veronica Codoni"", ids = ""6678592""); list(name = ""Yuna Blum"", ids = ""38656024""); list(name = ""Mete Civelek"", ids = ""2285734""); list(name = ""Carole Proust"", ids = ""2215745""); list(name = ""Oscar FranzÃ©n"", ids = ""40052238""); list(name = ""Johan L.

R/EBcoexpress implements the approach of Dawson and Kendziorski using R, a freely available, open source statistical programming language. The approach identifies differential co-expression (DC) by examining the correlations among gene pairs using an empirical Bayesian approach, producing a false discovery rate controlled list of DC pairs. This interrogation of DC gene pairs complements but is distinct from differential expression analyses, under the general goal of understanding differential regulation across biological conditions.

264f4ed74bd4ae79a08d678ce9e0fbee8273a1f0,Hypothermic effects on gas exchange performance of membrane oxygenator and blood coagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass in pigs.,"INTRODUCTION
Whether hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass could attenuate both blood coagulation and platelet activation compared to normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass remains elusive.


METHODS
Biocompatibility of a polymer-coated cardiopulmonary bypass circuit was comparatively assessed by plasma proteomics between juvenile pigs undergoing hypothermic (23Â°C) cardiopulmonary bypass and those undergoing normothermic (37Â°C) cardiopulmonary bypass (nâ€‰=â€‰6, respectively). Plasma samples were taken three times: 5â€‰minutes after initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass (T5, before cooling), just before declamping and rewarming (Tc), and just before termination of cardiopulmonary bypass (Trw, 120â€‰minutes). Proteomic analysis was quantitively performed by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification labeling. Thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT III) were measured by enzyme immunoassay, and vitamin K-dependent protein C (PROC), Î²-thromboglobulin (TG), and P-selectin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Blood gas analyses evaluated oxygenator performance.


RESULTS
Hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass had a significantly higher PaO2 at Tc and lower PaCO2 at Trw than normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. Two hundred twenty-four proteins were identified with statistical criteria of both protein confidence (>95%) and false discovery rate (<5%). Six of these proteins significantly decreased at Tc than at T5 in hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (pâ€‰=â€‰0.02-0.04), with three related to platelet degranulation. Protein C decreased at Trw compared with T5 in normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). Thrombin-antithrombin complex had a slightly larger increase with normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass at Trw than with hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. Î²-thromboglobulin and P-selectin levels were significantly lower at Trw with hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass than with normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (pâ€‰=â€‰0.04).


CONCLUSION
Hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass attenuated platelet degranulation/blood coagulation and maintained better oxygenator performance compared to normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass in juvenile pigs.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kazuhiro Akeho"", ids = ""13980690""); list(name = ""Hayato Nakata"", ids = ""37259645""); list(name = ""Shoichi Suehiro"", ids = ""13516454""); list(name = ""Kouji Shimizu"", ids = ""11096506""); list(name = ""Kensuke Imai"", ids = ""46376364""); list(name = ""Akane Yamaguchi"", ids = ""145854618""); list(name = ""Ken-ichi Matsumoto"", ids = ""46688148""); list(name = ""Teiji Oda"", ids = ""49188702"")",,,Perfusion,,"

8770708f917efb5fc675e4e783ffc3573c612fdb,Cerebellar Gray Matter Alterations in Huntington Disease: A Voxel-Based Morphometry Study,"Neuropathological and neuroimaging studies in Huntington disease (HD) have suggested a role for the cerebellum. Our goal was to perform a detailed evaluation of cerebellar morphology. We performed the Unified HD rating scale (UHDRS) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) in 26 HD patients and 26 healthy controls. We created a two-sample test to analyze cerebellar gray matter (GM) differences between groups and another to correlate GM alterations with UHDRS and MOCA, corrected for age, expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats, and disease duration using the spatially unbiased atlas template (SUIT)-SPM-toolbox which preserves anatomical detailing. We found increased GM density in the anterior cerebellum compared to controls. Higher GM density in the postero-superior lobe correlated with mood symptoms. Worse motor function and better cognitive function correlated with GM changes in the posterior cerebellum (false discovery rate (FDR) correction pÂ <Â 0.05 and kÂ >Â 100Â voxels).

2d958832ef9bb50ced0acf703864fe29181d0902,Pd1-10 Supraspinal Control of Lower Urinary Tract Function in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury: an Fmri Study,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The control of the lower urinary tract (LUT) is a complex, multilevel process involving both the peripheral and central nervous system. Most patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) suffer from neurogenic LUT dysfunction and LUT symptoms severely impair the patientsâ€™ health-related quality of life. Although there are several concepts regarding neuronal control and perception in the normal and pathological LUT condition, the exact mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated. METHODS: In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we prospectively assessed 20 patients (mean age 43 years old, range 25e75) with cervical and thoracic SCI (12 with complete and 8 with incomplete lesion) suffering from neurogenic detrusor overactivity. All subjects underwent data acquisition in a 3 Tesla scanner. The scan paradigm (SP) comprised 3 different bladder stimulations: (1) repetitive bladder filling of 100mL body warm saline starting with an empty bladder, (2) repetitive infusion and withdrawal (100mL) of body warm saline starting with a pre-filled bladder and (3) repetitive bladder filling of 100mL cold saline. Date was analysed using SPM8. Second-level random effects group analysis (at a voxel-threshold of P<0.001 using false discovery rate correction at cluster level) was performed to account for between subject variability. Only subjects with significant activity (first-level analysis, P1â„40.05 familywise error rate) were included. RESULTS: 6 subjects had to be excluded from certain analysis due to excessive head motions, autonomic dysreflexia or urinary incontinence during data acquisition. At first-level analysis, we found significant activation in 67% (12/17), 56% (9/15) and 66% (10/15) for SP (1), (2) and (3), respectively. At second-level analysis, significant activation was found in all 3 SP. (1): right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45), left middle frontal gyrus (BA 10/46), left superior medial frontal gyrus, dorsal posterior cingulate area (BA 31) and bilateral middle temporal gyrus (BA21); (2): anterior left insula and inferior parietal lobe; (3): right precentral gyrus (BA 6) and left superior parietal lobe (BA 7). Activations were seen in both complete and incomplete SCI patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our patients with SCI, significant brain activation similar as reported for healthy subjects, non-neurological and other neurological patients with detrusor overactivity was detected. SP (1) showed activation in more brain areas than (2) and (3). Our findings suggest that extra-spinal sensory pathways might also be involved in LUT control.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lorenz Leitner"", ids = ""39477208""); list(name = ""Matthias Walter"", ids = ""144987372""); list(name = ""Patrick Freund"", ids = ""46331057""); list(name = ""Ulrich Mehnert"", ids = ""2484728""); list(name = ""Martina D.

bf29dcd92f0f6b650196c8d8351fd0ef91e7701b,A stochastic downhill search algorithm for estimating the local false discovery rate,"Screening for differential gene expression in microarray studies leads to difficult large-scale multiple testing problems. The local false discovery rate is a statistical concept for quantifying uncertainty in multiple testing. We introduce a novel estimator for the local false discovery rate that is based on an algorithm which splits all genes into two groups, representing induced and noninduced genes, respectively. Starting from the full set of genes, we successively exclude genes until the gene-wise p-values of the remaining genes look like a typical sample from a uniform distribution. In comparison to other methods, our algorithm performs compatibly in detecting the shape of the local false discovery rate and has a smaller bias with respect to estimating the overall percentage of noninduced genes. Our algorithm is implemented in the Bioconductor compatible R package TWILIGHT version 1.0.1, which is available from http://compdiag.molgen.mpg.de/software or from the Bioconductor project at http://www.bioconductor.org.",2004,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""SÃ¡ndor Scheid"", ids = ""2596602""); list(name = ""Reinhold Spang"", ids = ""38764375"")",96401004ad3ab64af3482d575ae25598913f5ce3; 69d6630f4dd2ad193b0a915f4881d528e3888832; f6a2a45e6de0a8d29810bb749d1c48cc5bb63a18; b86788ef6c447b7a6b0ff821724c81ff628ba448; 137be7abf4fbef42ddbcee86bf012a5e7d71bd58; 58f1b2476fd50341aa886e3c95c8adef85ff8e95; d3950396051b4b7dee4d5d9f3c10191f9e5c8b8f; 60ae6045db2712f8025402606dfc57b3ac2886de; ae2f35f077b750b7376aae5390cf012d8d5be59c; fa4810b8a2d2ed041867191a4b2dfb5e7d2080af; 16b8f7711064a21d7c0d328c9dbbc5187d33f6e7; 364c937a52e20edaf043933357bc6d5bbdfe3bad; 7e6668093a214850a46d74f53b823067394f0266; 446f6092819b10f7898e2aa5a2507c958a20d38f; f1e7570781fba2ac576049f589308fcf794ec768; f9084c9b61156a3ca6a5a6f8965a38bd7f0df980; 0cb64a5dc4b4ebca3a3e1d3d50c4ae74ce7c5af2; 65c63d8a41f66a6f6fde19adf8d0b33fce6397ce; 883eeba3f42d2eabe9a19891468324e1e132e62d; 289355a54eee1fad98471f32105823cb059a5b76; fb6c10d1fdae02a12641e9f5e84f3eed81c5a5c8; 422349d81c2f279c58c1d0586cd911b5eaef7add; 949225972b308425359ce046d5418c914288f66a; 1b401062762e6d39a7d05cbeecb621eb28dd2cc5; 56f76d7b283fad276eaeaf5a86b3516cbf8c3e68; 3cb30c343050a63015eecda22ac54c93529d2b55; edec817445746f2e329aa4bb605731735b60bfee; 8b9f50ab0978c5ab9825e89b24c83e1c5a9f73bd; 0116ef322f3fc25e41ddb0df40aade428aad45d6; e37c8acea9e807e2725c2b13b7d2673143229601; 1c796e57afdadaadf935b0031c327a4158fca3d9; 7c62354b2ddee17616e3d68758662a9d42c65a3c,21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; 043a0d6f0703d89ad5a1759d14bd931c6d9bd9b5; ee9ad5e8189b401cc8f4b17995d31c2e5de00cc0; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; c5d8dd126d8a22f1a8b24c23dc04d75e6caebd71; 422adc24881a92ba1d934dc7bc1b686764e6336e; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 7ccdb4cad5622783e44a3a70f5ee88cf067cefd4; 4df1ee2955b90258c8aeb25d032c71c4c21e042f; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; b8608bff54e1cc933eead9e40c725d7933a567ff; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; 08600900eac695fdba3bf453c6f02a6bf4b7f236; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; f731f5810b79982cdd5da5330ee98e54f9c34be4; 7cae14836295b4dc43bbc66e7295658d9d4932d4,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,1,98-108

fa04f96246ea164d7796830b7b9ce63395166b51,Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in human placentas suggest developmental origins of complex diseases,"Epidemiologic studies support that at least part of the risk of chronic diseases in childhood and even adulthood may have an in utero origin, and the placenta is a key organ that plays a pivotal role in fetal growth and development. The transcriptomes of 159 human placenta tissues were profiled by genome-wide RNA sequencing (Illumina High-Seq 2500), and linked to fetal genotypes assessed by a high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array (Illumina MegaEx). Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) across all annotated transcripts were mapped and examined for enrichment for disease susceptibility loci annotated in the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) catalog. We discovered 3218 cis- and 35 trans-eQTLs atâ€‰â‰¤10% false discovery rate in human placentas. Among the 16â€‰439 known disease loci of genome-wide significance, 835 were placental eSNPs (enrichment foldâ€‰=â€‰1.68, Pâ€‰=â€‰7.41e-42). Stronger effect sizes were observed between GWAS SNPs and gene expression in placentas than what has been reported in other tissues, such as the correlation between asthma risk allele, rs7216389-T and Gasdermin-B (GSDMB) in placenta (r2=27%) versus lung (r2=6%). Finally, our results suggest the placental eQTLs may mediate the function of GWAS loci on postnatal disease susceptibility. Results suggest that transcripts in placenta are under tight genetic control, and that placental gene networks may influence postnatal risk of multiple human diseases lending support for the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Shouneng Peng"", ids = ""2995583""); list(name = ""Maya A Deyssenroth"", ids = ""17761970""); list(name = ""Antonio F Di Narzo"", ids = ""2704710""); list(name = ""Luca Lambertini"", ids = ""3112639""); list(name = ""Carmen J.

HLA-DQA1, -DQB1, and -DRB1 have been associated with development of tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome in case reports and small case series, but information about HLA genetic susceptibility to drug hypersensitivity-related ATIN (D-ATIN) or other types of ATIN is limited. In this article, we genotyped 154 patients with ATIN of different causes and 200 healthy controls at HLA-DQA1, -DQB1, and -DRB1 loci. We found that there was no difference between patients with D-ATIN and TINU in the carrier's frequency of HLA-DQA1, -DQB1, or -DRB1 Patients with Sjogren's syndrome-ATIN and IgG4-related ATIN presented a different pattern of tested HLA alleles. HLA-DQA1*0104 (p value corrected by false discovery rate method [Pc] = 4.72 Ã— 10-22, odds ratio [OR] = 13.81), -DQB1*0503 (Pc = 1.95 Ã— 10-14, OR = 9.51), and -DRB1*1405 (Pc = 8.06 Ã— 10-19, OR = 12.80) were significant risk alleles for the occurrence of D-ATIN and TINU. There were no significant associations between tested HLA alleles and ATIN induced by other causes. Patients with D-ATIN/TINU carrying HLA-DQA1*0104/DQB1*0503/DRB1*1405 had higher peak serum creatinine and more severe renal tubulointerstitial inflammatory impairment. They also had significantly higher levels of tubular HLA-DR and HLA-DQ expression, which were correlated with the numbers of interstitial CD4+ T lymphocytes (r = 0.975, p < 0.001 and r = 0.832, p = 0.005, respectively) and monocytes/macrophages (r = 0.721, p = 0.004 and r = 0.615, p = 0.02, respectively). In conclusion, patients with D-ATIN or TINU have genetic susceptibility in HLA-DQA1, -DQB1, and -DRB1 alleles. HLA-DQA1*0104/DQB1*0503/DRB1*1405 serves as a significant risk haplotype for development of D-ATIN and TINU, which might facilitate renal tubulointerstitial inflammation by enhancing Ag-presenting capacity of renal tubular cells.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yan Hui Jia"", ids = ""47417051""); list(name = ""Tao Su"", ids = ""50346837""); list(name = ""Yanghui Gu"", ids = ""10782173""); list(name = ""Cui Cui Li"", ids = ""29699384""); list(name = ""Xu-Jie Zhou"", ids = ""10237945""); list(name = ""Jianqun Su"", ids = ""46176168""); list(name = ""Pingping Sun"", ids = ""49262289""); list(name = ""Jiawei Tang"", ids = ""145054647""); list(name = ""Liu Yang"", ids = ""1687351""); list(name = ""Gang Liu"", ids = ""144742482""); list(name = ""Li Yang"", ids = ""48064456"")",,,Journal of immunology,201 2,"

e6c86329a3330c07ccc54d94f1e5346e18771038,Large-scale phosphoproteome analysis of human liver tissue by enrichment and fractionation of phosphopeptides with strong anion exchange chromatography.,"The mixture of phosphopeptides enriched from proteome samples are very complex. To reduce the complexity it is necessary to fractionate the phosphopeptides. However, conventional enrichment methods typically only enrich phosphopeptides but not fractionate phosphopeptides. In this study, the application of strong anion exchange (SAX) chromatography for enrichment and fractionation of phosphopeptides was presented. It was found that phosphopeptides were highly enriched by SAX and majority of unmodified peptides did not bind onto SAX. Compared with Fe(3+) immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Fe(3+)-IMAC), almost double phosphopeptides were identified from the same sample when only one fraction was generated by SAX. SAX and Fe(3+)-IMAC showed the complementarity in enrichment and identification of phosphopeptides. It was also demonstrated that SAX have the ability to fractionate phosphopeptides under gradient elution based on their different interaction with SAX adsorbent. SAX was further applied to enrich and fractionate phosphopeptides in tryptic digest of proteins extracted from human liver tissue adjacent to tumorous region for phosphoproteome profiling. This resulted in the highly confident identification of 274 phosphorylation sites from 305 unique phosphopeptides corresponding to 168 proteins at false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.96%.",2008,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Guanghui Han"", ids = ""2626307""); list(name = ""Mingliang Ye"", ids = ""8493740""); list(name = ""Houjiang Zhou"", ids = ""49565701""); list(name = ""Xinning Jiang"", ids = ""2702237""); list(name = ""Shun Feng"", ids = ""9137876""); list(name = ""Xiaogang Jiang"", ids = ""2270793""); list(name = ""Ruijun Tian"", ids = ""48879375""); list(name = ""Dafang Wan"", ids = ""101106924""); list(name = ""Hanfa Zou"", ids = ""3694471""); list(name = ""Jianren Gu"", ids = ""143962338"")",6300f772d264ae4e97073e130a3cfa918e8d8122; 3b36bd12f4d7214ab929f1fd6431823a933c6382; f2d902cd1da95379a48bf3221e33b3bddf0292b4; 0f7ede416ac598c82cc2ba25b348eedc0226b090; 113c075f4fe199939c26b72bf85f0d3cb2c29d84; c6ca608649acdef2672d8d8204eac7251d3c3a95; cb2530b0e857841b20c327a6ee2000c53281e09a; 55f935f62444befafbafde9dec701d0ff71086c1; 2b2a8ee391c781b390572edc72ae3d75444218c9; 2bf302a762a53eecf5a8bb9576d14619838e52fa; b9482c2cd5e7001a19e9d32d467fe325ef3c0619; 4ec4157b2946510ccd3b8fd62d19b2fe4c7568cb; c1bacaf9d6af472cd3cd7c8db66c4f3cc76148b8; 29aebac3b8924454e9e3637b8cf75f68cc5e5e7a; 1e877063eb3d9a7d4795ad838d5d54de613df3c7; 3342c2b60b3f1a731604f1274fdfbdfc6e4371a6; 19c0cd3abbb7a30302109f01a029c1f90e712828; 0df1c7e445fbfd5c3795ecdf63de9da35e6df12c; 24860210d435899580fb4cc46e52035badd1a43b; 78a9bff2af14b3e3cd6904056071da2d54f81cc4; de78d55dabab5f72bed02e529d291b7b9ebb94a6; 53926518a1e7f62e23699decf28f6a0c06ed94bd; 97e0bef88b75cf77f0adce1f12c268f43cad438b; 409c94d43bc8c04de5ffffc5baf3a857d00239f4; 618da81dd93858a346be734e191cdb6665131033; 14b6ffedf3408fe5069d146a799c1e8429e1cf9b; 5dda5e860a520c0ad857b93a230f26a2b2820e0a; 93f07cfd4d79c08e78cf61a94c260434fb69293b; a229e26028cc1b705a5c3c8330ac05bdfd2e0cb2; 2d298c83fe00ba3951c89700146230b87005e490; 68a1499e631ed6bf0d6cad680465b35d52bd1d17; 1d8045c444cda626c267d8bc83846e2713992f58; 37f4dacdb62d6cc767a4e0e064852cc18dbb9535; d8b4be956c2d0d85c05af6e0f38924aa35139a72; dd6d5d5a6df8f16a7e23f52c648711aee4c79465; c5ce698d58d476976dd21fa6fb3b15861bc0ad72; c13b44c3797721a33d466cbbf0aa27ebf0bbee7f; ed47370a9cdc36158af36e3891aeadf9512fbdbd; f57f25495a6c7801e142411d40bfa8444991d1a2; f8b80fcd325b8acd599d9aa714f8d06aa380df58; 562474e939d21b54f0c070ed85750b61c8134bcb; 9b7486d4b29f912d73457723d2d7e5b5e3a4d1bf; 13e5c626e94aef395795b9186d2e490e58220c89; aa0938fb355e15ea3d7cf43c88e557a7f4e4500e; 9f9b809b5104c3eae6e875f8a723f91a1ffe8d37; 545482530539a198c7c3723eec520600d95987da; fa28e7929016103d177426c1d3d84403d3e11451; e13cf9e4692fa19d32246525b74023b9b3ad73a4; 360b160662a3e9e15a91e43950b7a81757375c28; c4e9a39f082dbf55702fe1979004de54d3c06d50; 2e5f78e43785ef1d88298eba736859edc6d610d0; 54f06b5ee657ee7b605d6038d91bf87746870294; 48994570132ebf7bfb5b820dde28d8b3463afcc8; a9a6f82ae06ea7effa31be2b8ddf40ca23ffcd5f; a55719022469f3dadbbd97b6adb8d46f280884f8; 63c0b028a3ade1043d435b2078ed348cfd705d9c; c4197fbcb1476a4f184cffd6b4276e7566c010b3; a7345d938e9699898ae350f9e9295b71d5ba5157; 14101fbd119eb517cb4e1acad19cf1c250d77dc5; 9033845d1f2c8ca1c1949daef7b1c87150ec1d42; 9cc56af2bd8d95ca981c7bde16174b4e905e3c67; a63ceea12fc16802bc6c3d0928d1138a3f08cc00; 64c89c2878c47e3144e44c8a5408c2a3a5dbc471; b193f0ea98e3f29da7ee89578af25b8c26f09227; 03097020d4508c90c186d2bffa5b027f4c896118; d550cdd5183e3f2d7528fb0207af20e81bafb3f7; c6dde20eef91682fbe79829b6eab3ac06220bda3; dd1d153d10798a18f3c55f579f728015c8e60184; dbadc7f69ab1978b951c32ec06a001c288243505; 39c31206b21950163a991ca896981542fe9dc3a0; 5995b0fed5b15cf6b2a7aafa194f3b67e87ed422; 16e768fdd1b6c25399873a9b596ee410765c5951; 1e148b4b9b1928a82b4f02bf2e4b3b6e45d99751; d22d978389210f99ceb6ec0a657146eee3eb277a; f8abbbeb81aad037c812006e91dda4f56536146e; b93248c36a01e7dc8a73c3789fa453d7bbca8975; 2d1b9aa43f2a5446bef7ac2510bee6b61e6454bb; f4bd2381c7d68b3d604e51193f0e85a2b44de81f; 0f22fe0340928b84eb259aa6a3d31178989966d7; abbf67051ae5f0c896f2ecf25af7b07c08fc0aac; 64e2b3e7a45a28b40ddfd08881db2e54effb46a7,,Proteomics,8 7,"

However, dependence among test statistics is critical for fdr control. The way in which this dependence structure is described represents the most prominent source of uncertainty of this statistical theme. Copulas play a relevant role among the techniques used to deal with uncertainty and dependence. This paper contributes to fill an existing gap in the scientific debate by exploring the connections between the literature on fdr and that on copulas. In particular, we aim at attracting the interest of the scientific community on this topic by identifying suitable classes of nonstandard copulas which ensure that fdr control can be attained for dependent test statistics.",2018,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Roy Cerqueti"", ids = ""2885122""); list(name = ""Claudio Lupi"", ids = ""3435933"")",8492ad84aba73bf05ccf7b0b14db89592347c6ee; 07873588e117f55e0b897938346f7fc5d6d50b84,,Int.

739b6844e716a99ac127be3a13d907885537627a,A muscle transcriptome analysis identifies positional candidate genes for a complex trait in pig.,"Muscle tenderness is an important complex trait for meat quality and thus for genetic improvement through animal breeding. However, the physiological or genetic control of tenderness development in muscle is still poorly understood. In this work, using transcriptome analysis, we found a relationship between gene expression variability and tenderness. Muscle (longissimus dorsi) samples from 30 F(2) pigs were characterized by Warner-Bratzler Shear Force (WBSF) on cooked meat as a measurement of muscle tenderness. Gene expression levels were measured using microarrays for 17 muscle samples selected to represent a range of WBSF values. Using a linear regression model, we determined that samples with WBSF values above 30 N could be effectively analysed for genes exhibiting a significant association of their expression level on shear force (false discovery rate <0.05). These genes were shown to be involved in three functional networks: cell cycle, energy metabolism and muscle development.

7a031a5b8a05fb810633678a1cd21299edf1b861,Biomarker Guidelines for High-Dimensional Genomic Studies in Transplantation: Adding Method to the Madness,"T rapid expansion of high dimensional â€œomicâ€ technologies and their rapidly falling costs have ushered in the era of precision medicine. However, large data sets are required for the training, discovery and validation of molecular signatures. Those aspects lead to significant challenges as these data sets are translated into diagnostic and predictive signatures of important clinical phenotypes, causing some to conclude metaphorically that â€œa thousand dollar genome may require a million dollar interpretation.â€ The pace of innovation and growth in this space has not allowed sufficient time to generate a set of standardized and established approaches to the bioinformatic needs necessary to process genetic/genomic data toward validated signatures. Instead, it seems that a robust literature on bioinformatics is emerging in parallel with biomarker discovery, leading to published claims that might not have been vetted sufficiently through accepted bioinformatics approaches. As a result, there appears to be some difficulty reaching consensus around the validation of published biomarkers. This issue is particularly relevant to the peer review process that frequently disagrees about the clinical validity and true predictive performance of studies adding to public skepticism and accusations of â€œhypeâ€ versus â€œhope.â€ Although many other related fields have rigid established criteria for validity, such as the need to have high statistical thresholds such as P values less than 10 in the case of Genome Wide Association Studies or False Discovery Rate",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sunil M.

b05eecceb5804e9bcb5d30e6b50cb5334c0fffc8,Meta-analysis of gene expression microarrays with missing replicates,"BackgroundMany different microarray experiments are publicly available today. It is natural to ask whether different experiments for the same phenotypic conditions can be combined using meta-analysis, in order to increase the overall sample size. However, some genes are not measured in all experiments, hence they cannot be included or their statistical significance cannot be appropriately estimated in traditional meta-analysis. Nonetheless, these genes, which we refer to as incomplete genes, may also be informative and useful.ResultsWe propose a meta-analysis framework, called ""Incomplete Gene Meta-analysis"", which can include incomplete genes by imputing the significance of missing replicates, and computing a meta-score for every gene across all datasets. We demonstrate that the incomplete genes are worthy of being included and our method is able to appropriately estimate their significance in two groups of experiments. We first apply the Incomplete Gene Meta-analysis and several comparable methods to five breast cancer datasets with an identical set of probes. We simulate incomplete genes by randomly removing a subset of probes from each dataset and demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms two other methods in terms of their false discovery rate. We also apply the methods to three gastric cancer datasets for the purpose of discriminating diffuse and intestinal subtypes.ConclusionsMeta-analysis is an effective approach that identifies more robust sets of differentially expressed genes from multiple studies. The incomplete genes that mainly arise from the use of different platforms may also have statistical and biological importance but are ignored or are not appropriately involved by previous studies. Our Incomplete Gene Meta-analysis is able to incorporate the incomplete genes by estimating their significance. The results on both breast and gastric cancer datasets suggest that the highly ranked genes and associated GO terms produced by our method are more significant and biologically meaningful according to the previous literature.",2010,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Fan Shi"", ids = ""48862090""); list(name = ""Gad Abraham"", ids = ""1787787""); list(name = ""Christopher Leckie"", ids = ""1688394""); list(name = ""Izhak Haviv"", ids = ""1778197""); list(name = ""Adam Kowalczyk"", ids = ""6311978"")",ef60a573ea19459c27b26a0a8b4f55fdc0a8ee32; b05eecceb5804e9bcb5d30e6b50cb5334c0fffc8; f4512e513b8d2ddb0b77bb0908c84a90c44dd575,4e02970079f50ddf2b70a632d2abafd750bc2de8; 84364e41289170b4d007b6d7254c55f320ef3e65; 48626e9ebe6ea9f907228bf044a8fac20c71b32c; fd6224b2dc886f206f1c3b3329a910238505b28f; bdfb57141b2141095ed942b28be24808aeba8d54; ebd19509d9b2cd9a5a7218d77b55f05a7b937ea8; 3d365a38952b695c9615116f8ccef96ad75358a9; 1037548f688bd3e566df0d4184509976695124cf; ed86ba250f3ccda0e5cd45f13ed393c829ce0adc; 008c99db3128a7c457ca6dc9662055a921c90b7a; 73e87460a00939120ef7be676f4cb65de7e08212; d14d7402d20bc6b9e3399f80705ff0fe77a0f82c; b05eecceb5804e9bcb5d30e6b50cb5334c0fffc8; eb61ee576e30b36d836a99c3ee734732dde2c220; dbf742c65257181c0a7d51b9408ccae4e1cb10be; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4e30f15536eed290f9152634d1e8edb29899b831; 0ddab94bcc7887a24d311dde581c94fac79428c3; 42c138e06a20bff640d4f6b8ba098a9086cebfc3; c0c724b4abbb17fb6d9061bb2febfe611f6a88cc; 30192fb40fb7b07e967d98a1d558de8c851a8426; 0498ecdf8a2723f7d36459149616336be378b0cd; bd3d516faf4451958ebd92361c5da5dbd75aed79; 040f26ece8e6c4bb627c73a622e047dfd3ee7604; 13ab20402494ac41ccc1ab89d33a4004fb3811f6; 953e4ccfb7ece3920e596f31551efbbf0c6122a9; a5e82ee0621f35bc3c1123dfbba32bad9932ef4d; 72ce58f7ffa222d7ff8782f1b625cdba5de5b21f; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 4ca1a045ac83ec05ebf382431fd5d7f7cf959a7f; 9c07c51fffda2a237fd9f7c4c0b2bb3f63f9b255; 36ed58fa79c9600be66ab88637293b1dc5526efd; 87f08a2be6148ea103f10b3625b8d3ee4f549dcb; 5ff9d12cc1dd66dde37d46880afc8adfc9c7a2d6; 5e40a9cc3bb6dadfff78b55defdf92cba209b58a; 0a75540ecf707b4c12ea42803a72d88dae9e241b; 1b37279dce5ca9606cbf62a1daf2cbc4dfecc339; 1417f6082110602d7ce36f6614e2f8bf46eb11d2; 73d6948a5fb62bd8c3fbbd612b1064003bcb2222; 0eaa28aa3612057f8af7c93c59e03f26e3f67ca8; b8b3632c31129a3a76fb380e87eeb1614b4a3f81; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 4029c4ddd8509a20f0cb3c9f81128cecee965ecf; 2098391def9f8db6d400497b9ba397d526d227c3; d3e6f7f5d833751071a5fafc2aa237467e3040aa; 036c98e4cea6998174d7bc29ea00c776ce412fdb,BMC Bioinformatics,12,84 - 84

These procedures may be one-step, step-up or step-down, and may control the familywise error rate (eg the Bonferroni, Sidak, Holm, Holland-Copenhaver, Hochberg and Rom procedures) or the false discovery rate (eg the Simes, Benjamini-Liu, Benjamini-Yekutieli and Benjamini-Krieger-Yekutieli procedures). smileplot, and its Stata 7 version smileplot7, work by calling multproc and then creating a smile plot, with data points corresponding to multiple estimated parameters, the P-values (on a reverse log scale) on the Y-axis, and the corresponding parameter estimates (or another variable) on the X-axis. There are Y-axis reference lines at the uncorrected and corrected overall critical P-values. The reference line at the corrected critical P-value, known as the parapet line, is interpreted informally as a boundary between data mining and data dredging. multproc, smileplot and smileplot7 are used on data sets with one observation per estimated parameter and data on estimates and their P-values, which may be created using parmby, parmest, statsby or postfile.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Roger Newson"", ids = ""69972866"")",e54fc6a41d919559af4e6c817e968e534f199a50,,Statistical Software Components,,
24a3ccb1e5d878bd5f8215cb963d7bf63943f9e7,Genome-wide analysis of allelic expression imbalance in human primary cells by high-throughput transcriptome resequencing,"Many disease-associated variants identified by genome-wide association (GWA) studies are expected to regulate gene expression. Allele-specific expression (ASE) quantifies transcription from both haplotypes using individuals heterozygous at tested SNPs. We performed deep human transcriptome-wide resequencing (RNA-seq) for ASE analysis and expression quantitative trait locus discovery. We resequenced double poly(A)-selected RNA from primary CD4(+) T cells (n = 4 individuals, both activated and untreated conditions) and developed tools for paired-end RNA-seq alignment and ASE analysis. We generated an average of 20 million uniquely mapping 45 base reads per sample. We obtained sufficient read depth to test 1371 unique transcripts for ASE. Multiple biases inflate the false discovery rate which we estimate to be approximately 50% for random SNPs. However, after controlling for these biases and considering the subset of SNPs that pass HapMap QC, 4.6% of heterozygous SNP-sample pairs show evidence of imbalance (P < 0.001). We validated four findings by both bacterial cloning and Sanger sequencing assays. We also found convincing evidence for allelic imbalance at multiple reporter exonic SNPs in CD6 for two samples heterozygous at the multiple sclerosis-associated variant rs17824933, linking GWA findings with variation in gene expression. Finally, we show in CD4(+) T cells from a further individual that high-throughput sequencing of genomic DNA and RNA-seq following enrichment for targeted gene sequences by sequence capture methods offers an unbiased means to increase the read depth for transcripts of interest, and therefore a method to investigate the regulatory role of many disease-associated genetic variants.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Graham A Heap"", ids = ""144094104""); list(name = ""Jennie H M Yang"", ids = ""32607909""); list(name = ""Kate Downes"", ids = ""4417907""); list(name = ""Barry C.

c4fcf44baf4d476a4d68cf14f3534234d6b63bfb,Associations between metabolites and pancreatic cancer risk in a large prospective epidemiological study.,"OBJECTIVE
To assess whether prediagnostic metabolites were associated with incident pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in a prospective cohort study.


DESIGN
We conducted an untargeted analysis of 554 known metabolites measured in prediagnostic serum (up to 24 years) to determine their association with incident PDAC in a nested case-control study of male smokers (372 matched case-control sets) and an independent nested case-control study that included women and non-smokers (107 matched sets). Metabolites were measured using Orbitrap Elite or Q-Exactive high-resolution/accurate mass spectrometers. Controls were matched to cases by age, sex, race, date of blood draw, and follow-up time. We used conditional logistic regression adjusted for age to calculate ORs and 95% CIs for a 1 SD increase in log-metabolite level separately in each cohort and combined the two ORs using a fixed-effects meta-analysis.


RESULTS
Thirty-one metabolites were significantly associated with PDAC at a false discovery rate <0.05 with 12 metabolites below the Bonferroni-corrected threshold (p<9.04Ã—10-5). Similar associations were observed in both cohorts. The dipeptides glycylvaline, aspartylphenylalanine, pyroglutamylglycine, phenylalanylphenylalanine, phenylalanylleucine and tryptophylglutamate and amino acids aspartate and glutamate were positively while the dipeptides tyrosylglutamine and Î±-glutamyltyrosine, fibrinogen cleavage peptide DSGEGDFXAEGGGVR and glutathione-related amino acid cysteine-glutathione disulfide were inversely associated with PDAC after Bonferroni correction. Five top metabolites demonstrated significant time-varying associations (p<0.023) with the strongest associations observed 10-15 years after participants' blood collection and attenuated thereafter.


CONCLUSION
Our results suggest that prediagnostic metabolites related to subclinical disease, Î³-glutamyl cycle metabolism and adiposity/insulin resistance are associated with PDAC.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rachael Stolzenberg-Solomon"", ids = ""1397428465""); list(name = ""Andriy Derkach"", ids = ""144041260""); list(name = ""Steven C.

d22d7eeb362b6b9566655ae8824792e960cd39b0,Improving tandem mass spectrum identification using peptide retention time prediction across diverse chromatography conditions.,"Most algorithms for identifying peptides from tandem mass spectra use information only from the final spectrum, ignoring non-mass-based information acquired routinely in liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analyses. One physiochemical property that is always obtained but rarely exploited is peptide chromatographic retention time. Efforts to use chromatographic retention time to improve peptide identification are complicated because of the variability of retention time in different experimental conditions-making retention time calculations nongeneralizable. We show that peptide retention time can be reliably predicted by training and testing a support vector regressor on a small collection of data from a single liquid chromatography run. This model can be used to filter peptide identifications with observed retention time that deviates from predicted retention time. After filtering, positive peptide identifications increase by as much as 50% at a false discovery rate of 3%. We demonstrate that our dynamically trained model generalizes well across diverse chromatography conditions and methods for generating peptides, in particular improving peptide identification using nonspecific proteases.",2007,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Aaron A.

c4ec336b7d2a4fa415c983e0ae1715372a4cd99b,Revealing weak differential gene expressions and their reproducible functions associated with breast cancer metastasis,"Based on microarray data, a basic task is to extract differentially expressed (DE) genes between disease states and their associated functions to understand disease mechanisms. However, few such analyses have been conducted for breast cancer metastasis, possibly owing to the uncertainty of the disease state assignment for patients, which may lead to an extremely low power of detecting DE genes. In this study, we analyzed five datasets composed of metastatic and non-metastatic breast primary cancer samples. For two datasets in which few DE genes could be detected by the conventional false discovery rate control approach, a clustering approach was applied to select a group of genes with large differential expression changes between two groups of samples, in which the powers of identifying DE genes increased greatly. Then, we showed that each of the five DE gene lists captured a part of the differential expression signals from which we were able to extract metastasis-associated functions non-randomly reproducible across different datasets. Our results highlighted that many general biological processes (such as 'cell division', 'cell cycle', 'microtubule-based processes' and 'chromosome segregation'), rather than only their sub-processes, may be globally altered during the course of breast cancer metastasis, characterizing cancer metastasis as a 'systems disease'.",2012,Computer Science; Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jinfeng Zou"", ids = ""2755311""); list(name = ""Chunxiang Hao"", ids = ""46511191""); list(name = ""Guini Hong"", ids = ""3317350""); list(name = ""Junjie Zheng"", ids = ""3087493""); list(name = ""Lang He"", ids = ""50671025""); list(name = ""Zheng Guo"", ids = ""144663071"")",ac685ccdc517e28a4fc597b5d94fbbc84da04e4d; 7f258765c27dacac5eea402f7bacbda62c7a89aa; f0542802a399376cda28da8abab3559dc3b32522; f1536ccc1af5c8bf3c15fd9edb238de228ac0a05; 6d79881d61fceec9df03f0db723746abaa682a04; 33807f959d0ca6701bf5a92cb2b3df5646cc9694,,Computational biology and chemistry,39,"

679d6dfc5b8c3507d1792b0a56ee0a2ea0bddae4,Spectrum-based method to generate good decoy libraries for spectral library searching in peptide identifications.,"As spectral library searching has received increasing attention for peptide identification, constructing good decoy spectra from the target spectra is the key to correctly estimating the false discovery rate in searching against the concatenated target-decoy spectral library. Several methods have been proposed to construct decoy spectral libraries. Most of them construct decoy peptide sequences and then generate theoretical spectra accordingly. In this paper, we propose a method, called precursor-swap, which directly constructs decoy spectral libraries directly at the ""spectrum level"" without generating decoy peptide sequences by swapping the precursors of two spectra selected according to a very simple rule. Our spectrum-based method does not require additional efforts to deal with ion types (e.g., a, b or c ions), fragment mechanism (e.g., CID, or ETD), or unannotated peaks, but preserves many spectral properties. The precursor-swap method is evaluated on different spectral libraries and the results of obtained decoy ratios show that it is comparable to other methods. Notably, it is efficient in time and memory usage for constructing decoy libraries.

434f473d61d01c38e84474175318087b893b7fd4,Controlling false discovery proportion in identification of drug-related adverse events from multiple system organ classes.,"Analyzing safety data from clinical trials to detect safety signals worth further examination involves testing multiple hypotheses, one for each observed adverse event (AE) type. There exists certain hierarchical structure for these hypotheses due to the classification of the AEs into system organ classes, and these AEs are also likely correlated. Many approaches have been proposed to identify safety signals under the multiple testing framework and tried to achieve control of false discovery rate (FDR). The FDR control concerns the expectation of the false discovery proportion (FDP). In practice, the control of the actual random variable FDP could be more relevant and has recently drawn much attention. In this paper, we proposed a two-stage procedure for safety signal detection with direct control of FDP, through a permutation-based approach for screening groups of AEs and a permutation-based approach of constructing simultaneous upper bounds for false discovery proportion. Our simulation studies showed that this new approach has controlled FDP. We demonstrate our approach using data sets derived from a drug clinical trial.",2019,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xianming M Tan"", ids = ""46880176""); list(name = ""Guanghan F Liu"", ids = ""4854605""); list(name = ""Donglin Zeng"", ids = ""145810704""); list(name = ""William G.

35dc96af4511a195a2daa9b6cd0156cdab14330c,Identification of a Plasma MicroRNA Profile Associated With Venous Thrombosis,"Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. Objective: Venous thrombosis (VT) is a complex condition with a highly heritable genetic component that predisposes one to its development. Certain microRNAs (miRNAs) might be used as biomarkers of VT, but few studies have examined miRNA expression in this respect. The aim of the present work was to identify a plasma miRNA profile associated with VT. Approach and Results: miRNAs were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in plasma samples from members of the GAIT-2 (Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia 2) population (n=935). A discovery phase involving the screening of 752 miRNAs from a subset of 104 GAIT-2 subjects was followed by an internal validation phase in which the selected miRNAs were quantified in the whole GAIT-2 population. In the discovery phase, 16 miRNAs were selected, including 9 associated with VT and 7 that correlated with an intermediate phenotype of VT. In the next phase, 4 miRNAs were validated as differentially expressed (false discovery rate, <0.1) in VT: hsa-miR-126-3p, hsa-miR-885-5p, hsa-miR-194-5p, and hsa-miR-192-5p. The 4 miRNAs each returned a significant (P<0.05) odds ratio for VT (range of 1.3â€“1.8). A risk model including the 4 miRNAs, age, and sex returned an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77. Moreover, all 4 miRNAs showed significant correlations with intermediate phenotypes of VT (eg, protein S and factor VII). The targets of the miRNAs in the blood coagulation pathway and their interactions are also discussed. Conclusions: The present results suggest a 4-miRNA plasma profile associated with VT is of potential use in predicting the risk of this condition.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alba Rodriguez-Rius"", ids = ""1562788643""); list(name = ""Sonia Mayordomo LÃ³pez"", ids = ""32446890""); list(name = ""Angel Martinez-Perez"", ids = ""1398217224""); list(name = ""Juan Carlos Souto"", ids = ""2855068""); list(name = ""JosÃ© Manuel Soria"", ids = ""90290255"")",,13866e2365c07f3fb05057d1cd3f10be4a799a6b; 1f74cd1b805d0e85d7df2be16ae532a68b756a5f; 5ba9d28ba7088d24daf5a9f9e269a4886ee298c5; a9e9bd83ecb56aac660f77d21161d3f74aa6b33b; fb30a8f22b6e9fffcf038f178acadc4c27a84d5b; ca8d11d59632b3f74d564d73d7c409ac4250811a; 6396ba01475d5cce24821d95385bab00ba2c71fe; 362f811de9818fea114c3aeb835e78f88d38cb7f; 917eab1f89d3249c561a6fe57c47a03fb2237597; 06e1f9b10070011ef7cc8ad535e5a15cba05a653; 3ca76054a091f372ce91eebb2257b71fcd12ea0f; b0b2c75fa6d3841948690d877d9f6f5eba1bb074; 423df88b6684176e1be20dcfe81de348760eeb42; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 5bcd55a56a06832ae172f8e60463e80fd0451abf; 0cbc9acda23be2ab9bf1cb02576eddec43858099; faac17fe064b8a996a5a45a0caa4d6aa6699aa76; 9646f5ee4a56bb8fb1219735d49bdb6228e87bbf; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; a174a1b5ebd6770de6f2b28a3358b74dc7ce373e; 6a7364f6ed2846ea2b705336a4c49dd287102a50; 3b16bb2a40be127a5c024413fd1790fb476c43a8; b41d762d9f65c1033a93d4d4a753a6d467c07ada; 5512f1ede01c5e4f6950d9f76ea4baf6f496655f; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; 78aee0bf8b4e45c3874c35ef366d81b6e6d410bd; 4b5cb805cfd287a4a4a0971742661f8fc68cf4ed; 1cbaaaf7ad49bced7b38626cea91f5f1629de1e6; 4aa5a404709fda6fb6208eb63ed35568648ba07a; 279156241b1d908004b66f86b6aaa81caac16111; dc623c073681270e6f4d2bc14476535f4f7df4da; ebc0576258a4d70be506ad9662995f0f8f68d2c5; 47d5538fc8d2768827bf9420c196fc4f183e2aeb; 5fada53f8905ec214cb445408fa5ee2387a36264; c87a4433c57ddabd50f32ca2c2d2197244692106; e545980725c688ba8a8112d1a7cd26e2c7e6cb8d; ff88cfb17f371377e405ee5e1c4d008ed44d06ff; 1dfa1e868883b469ffa2a65cab038d353fb26e85; 1b6d2c08e5b0b7ec50366b0175d266ed37ab7d77,,40,1392 - 1399
e67a2c112a304af6af743e8391545f2d9ed5dd8f,EphrinB2 regulation by PTH and PTHrP revealed by molecular profiling in differentiating osteoblasts.,"With the aim of identifying new pathways and genes regulated by PTH(1-34) and PTH-related protein 1-141 [PTHrP(1-141)] in osteoblasts, this study was carried out using a mouse marrow stromal cell line, Kusa 4b10, that acquires features of the osteoblastic phenotype in long-term culture conditions. After the appearance of functional PTH receptor 1 (PTHR1) in Kusa 4b10 cells, they were treated with either PTH(1-34) or PTHrP(1-141), and RNA was subjected to Affymetrix whole mouse genome array. The microarray data were validated using quantitative real-time RT-PCR on independently prepared RNA samples from differentiated Kusa 4b10, UMR106 osteosarcoma cells, and primary mouse calvarial osteoblasts, as well as in vivo using RNA from metaphyseal bone after a single PTH injection to 3-wk-old and 6-mo-old ovariectomized rats. Of the 45,101 probes used on the microarray, 4675 were differentially expressed by >or=1.5 fold, with a false discovery rate <0.1. Among the regulated genes, ephrinB2 mRNA was upregulated in response to both PTH and PTHrP. This was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR in vitro and in vivo. Increased ephrinB2 protein was also shown in vitro by Western blotting, and immunostaining of femur sections showed ephrinB2 in both osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Production of ephrinB2, as well as other ephrins or Eph family members, did not change during differentiation of Kusa 4b10 cells. Blockade of ephrinB2/EphB4 interaction resulted in inhibition of mineralization of Kusa 4b10 cells. Together with the shown effect of ephrinB2 promoting osteoblast differentiation and bone formation through action on EphB4, the data raise the possibility that PTH or PTHrP might regulate ephrinB2 to act in a paracrine or autocrine manner on EphB4 or EphB2 in the osteoblast, contributing as a local event to the anabolic action of PTH or PTHrP.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Elizabeth H.

a599600e13e8b689ed347be1c29f7e906b4f2c6b,Hippocampal and caudate volume reductions in antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia.,"BACKGROUND
Enlarged ventricles and reduced hippocampal volume are consistently found in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. Studies investigating brain structure in antipsychotic-naive patients have generally focused on the striatum. In this study, we examined whether ventricular enlargement and hippocampal and caudate volume reductions are morphological traits of antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia.


METHODS
We obtained high-resolution 3-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans for 38 antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients and 43 matched healthy controls by use of a 3-T scanner. We warped the brain images to each other by use of a high-dimensional intersubject registration algorithm. We performed voxel-wise group comparisons with permutation tests. We performed small volume correction for the hippocampus, caudate and ventricles by use of a false discovery rate correction (p < 0.05) to control for multiple comparisons. We derived and analyzed estimates of brain structure volumes. We grouped patients as those with (n = 9) or without (n = 29) any lifetime substance abuse to examine the possible effects of substance abuse.


RESULTS
We found that hippocampal and caudate volumes were decreased in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. We found no ventricular enlargement, differences in global volume or significant associations between tissue volume and duration of untreated illness or psychopathology. The hippocampal volume reductions appeared to be influenced by a history of substance abuse. Exploratory analyses indicated reduced volume of the nucleus accumbens in patients with first-episode schizophrenia.


LIMITATIONS
This study was not a priori designed to test for differences between schizophrenia patients with or without lifetime substance abuse, and this subgroup was small.


CONCLUSION
Reductions in hippocampal and caudate volume may constitute morphological traits in antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients. However, the clinical implications of these findings are unclear. Moreover, past substance abuse may accentuate hippocampal volume reduction. Magnetic resonance imaging studies addressing the potential effects of substance abuse in antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients are warranted.",2010,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""BjÃ¸rn H.

0216744b1269bcb96dc29580509d4f52b9afda86,Application of AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600 for Proteomics Research,"AB SCIEX has just launched the new high resolution LC-MS/MS system,TripleTOF 5600,which is developed based on the renowned API 5500 TripleQuad and QSTAR Elite(QqTOF) platforms.This new AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600 LC-MS/MS system is capable of delivering high quality results for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of complex proteomics samples at high throughput.In order to evaluate its performance,experiments based on nanospray liquid chromatography coupled with TripleTOF 5600 were developed and reported herein.The high resolution,high sensitivity and high mass accuracy,realized at the fastest MS acquisition speed(50 Hz with information dependant acquisition mode),leads to the identification of a total of 10,719 unique peptides and 1174 protein groups(at 1% global false discovery rate) in a single LC-MS/MS run of tryptic digest of yeast cell lysate.An average of 34 MS/MS spectra per second achieved in the analysis is the key to such excellent result.In addition,we analysed a mixture of five known proteins with a set of heavy isotope labeled peptides to exam the quantitation capability for TripleTOF 5600.We obtained high sequence coverage of these five proteins,for example,53% for 100amol of Peroxiredoxin 1 protein.The RMS error for all the peptides detected is only 1.7 ppm,which demonstrates the excellent mass accuracy of the TripleTOF 5600.Excellent quantitation result was obtained with high accuracy,indicating that TripleTOF 5600 is able to deliver quantitation results same as triple quadrupole type systems.",2010,Chemistry,"list(name = ""Ciex Asia"", ids = ""93103583"")",,,,,
56f61707cf4565ede214f3909008c1644a89e393,DNA microarray analysis of labial salivary glands in IgG4-related disease: comparison with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome.,"OBJECTIVE
To compare gene expression in labial salivary glands (LSGs) from patients with IgG4-related disease with that in LSGs from patients with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (SS).


METHODS
Gene expression was analyzed by DNA microarray in LSG samples from 5 patients with IgG4-related disease, 5 SS patients, and 3 healthy controls. Genes differentially expressed in IgG4-related disease and SS were identified, and gene annotation enrichment analysis of these differentially expressed genes was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. Validation of the results was performed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using LSG samples from 9 patients with IgG4-related disease, 10 SS patients, and 4 controls.


RESULTS
Gene expression patterns in patients with IgG4-related disease, SS patients, and healthy controls were quite different from each other in hierarchical clustering as well as in principal components analysis. In IgG4-related disease compared with SS, a total of 1,771 probe sets (corresponding to 1,321 genes) were identified as up-regulated, and 1,785 probe sets (corresponding to 1,320 genes) were identified as down-regulated (false discovery rate of <5%). GO term analysis indicated that the up-regulated set of differentially expressed genes in IgG4-related disease encoded proteins that function in cell proliferation, extracellular matrix organization, and organ development. PCR validated significantly higher expression of lactotransferrin in patients with IgG4-related disease than in SS patients (P < 0.05) and significantly higher expression of CCL18 in patients with IgG4-related disease than in SS patients and controls (P < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
The results clearly showed that the gene expression pattern in LSGs from patients with IgG4-related disease is different from that in LSGs from SS patients.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Hiroto Tsuboi"", ids = ""36437690""); list(name = ""Yuji Nakai"", ids = ""2359288""); list(name = ""Mana Iizuka"", ids = ""4306312""); list(name = ""Hiromitsu Asashima"", ids = ""8377764""); list(name = ""Chihiro Hagiya"", ids = ""8564186""); list(name = ""Sayaka Tsuzuki"", ids = ""7965192""); list(name = ""Tomoya Hirota"", ids = ""1695924""); list(name = ""Haruka Miki"", ids = ""6769944""); list(name = ""Shinya Hagiwara"", ids = ""8342981""); list(name = ""Yuya Kondo"", ids = ""3382472""); list(name = ""Akihiko Tanaka"", ids = ""2095728""); list(name = ""Masafumi Moriyama"", ids = ""35173177""); list(name = ""Isao Matsumoto"", ids = ""48052983""); list(name = ""Seiji Nakamura"", ids = ""48557928""); list(name = ""Toshio Yoshihara"", ids = ""2249461""); list(name = ""Keiko Abe"", ids = ""49897278""); list(name = ""Takayuki Sumida"", ids = ""3087215"")",7f9b144ff0e4a3739ae70e383056571f23de6047; 2feefcec51ef10543f5cc22496f59d8e6c1072db; 8eff23a5449faf21eba31cb49aa67c859b00fb94; b3695244ec3f22ceffc91db18dc7677491b77d89; 142c4403cffb790366deea67df8b48fdc5fdb1e3; 5424a773741b90b7be79a8d36be31892101d5c87; 1f9612f52a978c96cd464f74cdbb35a6c2e9b83b; 8806861dd03ef86ad2ded30452cbb571ea5db314; c62d39e787ad41d81c873c83e734ad2c61d2f615; 4da4c25ae16a49d690d4f073ab662cbe9dc44732; 2bf754674ce3100c9d8adb46db1704bb4de2602c,,Arthritis & rheumatology,66 10,"

2f7ba3f2add64a9aeff974281073493de05f2d76,Comparison of microarray preprocessing methods.,"Data preprocessing in microarray technology is a crucial initial step before data analysis is performed. Many preprocessing methods have been proposed but none has proved to be ideal to date. Frequently, datasets are limited by laboratory constraints so that the need is for guidelines on quality and robustness, to inform further experimentation while data are yet restricted. In this paper, we compared the performance of four popular methods, namely MAS5, Li & Wong pmonly (LWPM), Li & Wong subtractMM (LWMM), and Robust Multichip Average (RMA). The comparison is based on the analysis carried out on sets of laboratory-generated data from the Bioinformatics Lab, National Institute of Cellular Biotechnology (NICB), Dublin City University, Ireland. These experiments were designed to examine the effect of Bromodeoxyuridine (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine, BrdU) treatment in deep lamellar keratoplasty (DLKP) cells. The methodology employed is to assess dispersion across the replicates and analyze the false discovery rate. From the dispersion analysis, we found that variability is reduced more effectively by LWPM and RMA methods. From the false positive analysis, and for both parametric and nonparametric approaches, LWMM is found to perform best. Based on a complementary q-value analysis, LWMM approach again is the strongest candidate. The indications are that, while LWMM is marginally less effective than LWPM and RMA in terms of variance reduction, it has considerably improved discrimination overall.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kabita Shakya"", ids = ""49411758""); list(name = ""Heather J.

245ff3728dd061383ed290e7c27627120f000c9b,PC-10â€ƒClassical HLA alleles are associated with prevalent and persistent cervical high-risk HPV infection in African women,"Background: Persistent cervical high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection is a necessary cause of cervical cancer. However, the genetic factors underlying its risk are not well understood. We hypothesized that immunogenetic variation plays a role in hrHPV infection and persistence. Therefore, we conducted a study of classical HLA alleles and their association with hrHPV infection and persistence. Methods: We characterized HPV infection using SPF25/LiPA10 in Nigerian women at baseline and at 6 months follow-up visits in 2014. hrHPV infection was prevalent if at least one carcinogenic HPV genotype was detected in a sample provided at the baseline visit and persistent if at least one carcinogenic HPV genotype was detected in each of the samples provided at the baseline and follow-up visits. Genotyping was performed with the Illumina Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array. Classical HLA alleles were imputed from genotypes in the MHC region using the HLA genotype imputation with attribute bagging (HIBAG) algorithm. HLA association tests were conducted under additive genetic models. P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the false discovery rate (FDR) method. Results: The mean (Â±SD) age of the study participants was 38 (Â±8) years, 48% (247/517) were HIV negative, 24% (125/517) were hrHPV positive at baseline and 10% (51/517) had persistent hrHPV infections. In multivariate regression models adjusted for age, HIV status and the first principal component, DQA1*01:02 (OR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.97; P = 0.03). and DQA1*02:01 (OR 1.89; 95% CI: 1.12 to 3.15; P = 0.03) were positively associated with prevalent but not persistent hrHPV infections, while DQA1*05:01 was negatively associated with prevalent hrHPV (OR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.85; P = 0.03) but positively associated with persistent cervical hrHPV infections (OR 2.46; 95% CI: 1.27 to 4.77; P = 0.04). Four haplotypes (A*30:01 - DQA1*05:01, B*07:02 - C*07:02, B*07:02 - DQA1*05:01 and C*07:02 - DQA1*05:01) were significantly associated with prevalent cervical hrHPV infections and several haplotypes that included the DQA1*05:01 allelic variant (including B*15:10 - DQA1*05:01, DQA1*05:01 - DQB1*02:01 and DQA1*05:01 - DRB1*03:01) were significantly associated with persistent cervical hrHPV infections. Six amino acids located on the DQA1 gene were associated with prevalent but not persistent cervical hrHPV infections. Conclusions: This study, the first to investigate the association between HLA alleles and persistent hrHPV risk in African women, has identified important risk alleles that merit further study. Our findings provide new insights into risk factors for hrHPV infection in women of African ancestry.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sally N Adebamowo"", ids = ""6485211""); list(name = ""Adebowale A.

86dc258969f37e3d453f8f8a11a5ca2395abfd91,A family of Bayes multiple testing procedures,"Under the model of independent test statistics, we propose a two-parameter family of Bayes multiple testing procedures. The two parameters can be viewed as tuning parameters. Using the Benjamini--Hochberg step-up procedure for controlling false discovery rate as a baseline for conservativeness, we choose the tuning parameters to compromise between the operating characteristics of that procedure and a less conservative procedure that focuses on alternatives that a priori might be considered likely or meaningful. The Bayes procedures do not have the theoretical and practical shortcomings of the popular stepwise procedures. In terms of the number of mistakes, simulations for two examples indicate that over a large segment of the parameter space, the Bayes procedure is preferable to the step-up procedure. Another desirable feature of the procedures is that they are computationally feasible for any number of hypotheses.

The challenge in health care sector is that for the same patient different doctors may diagnose differently. To overcome the challenge in health care sector, automated classification tools are used to diagnose the disease accurately and efficiently and it may also reduce the time and burden on doctors. In this paper we analyze and compare the behaviour of five different classification algorithms namely Naive Bayes classifier, Decision tree algorithm, AdaBoost algorithm, K means clustering and Support Vector Machines on the given medical data sets.

In total, 97 genes were differently expressed (fold change > Â±2; false discovery rate (FDR) p-value < 0.01) between the groups, including genes regulating circadian rhythm (Per1, Per2 and Per3), extracellular matrix (Spo1, Spon2), and neuromuscular synaptic transmission (Slc18a3, Slc5a7, Chrnb4, Chrna3, Snap25). The highest increase in expression was observed for immunoglobulin genes (Igkv1-122, Igkv4-68) of unknown function, but surprisingly the absence of microbiota did not change the expression of the genes responsible for recognizing microbes and their products. We found that urinary bladder weight was approximately 25% lighter in GF mice (p = 0.09 for males, p = 0.005 for females) and in mice treated with broad spectrum of antibiotics (p = 0.0002). In conclusion, our data indicate that microbiota is an important determinant of urinary bladder physiology controlling its gene expression and size.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Blanka Roje"", ids = ""82952914""); list(name = ""Anamaria Elek"", ids = ""90605879""); list(name = ""Vinko Palada"", ids = ""51064944""); list(name = ""Joana Bom"", ids = ""144958406""); list(name = ""Aida IljazoviÄ‡"", ids = ""5322691""); list(name = ""Ana BlaÅ¾eviÄ‡ SimiÄ‡"", ids = ""48547100""); list(name = ""Lana SuÅ¡ak"", ids = ""83063431""); list(name = ""Katarina ViloviÄ‡"", ids = ""6058651""); list(name = ""Till Strowig"", ids = ""114760106""); list(name = ""Kristian Vlahovicek"", ids = ""2526711""); list(name = ""JanoÅ¡ TerziÄ‡"", ids = ""31621211"")",,9a9bd3174f25ebee371fa1b2980432b1ec21ee21; 772f5fca88de0f6f38116d73cc32e23efe780a10; 675da7ce40878870e42846d66b3dbbdf67f6f9a2; 75cf364442ba0321580312ad061a691898788a13; 2225a3957e8f8e806d5b10ef54e501c4b0202b9a; 88caef16f3b7fdc53c71252e5f240a0daff5bbab; 59cabda9d74f657498aefb49cd8a4be83c832b53; ec2d86de0ceb1ad167ae68d99352041116c3c751; 8806c1503c644476653a9755d15d18bcf42bbc60; 7c010424be691550e6cad8ec75ead7395d0d2983; f514ee7ba7a835645e2d1e7db1fb2e04d3d527e3; 23952f6b64ae102e2d6ce0fdcb80b46efc4150a7; e7fbdba1b7a105f0ae22a483324c7ea9ec1f48bd; 8ad71a1813b5bc329fa5c678f012dd57c95d45e2; 0f8a4338518354a2ac802dd89a18fbcfc9e60e4d; f651d118d713bdcf1af9f82b8276d4539fbdf389; a7925ce4eaeff400f418e30bcf2f602d9957246d; 38a2c0e8107f297d9c23e403621a75e50419e610; 6c5aff76d5d2d34e552f1efe75eda22b47185ec0; c2179f22808919488d3caf7f86eb6dd05d4d90b2; 2a18eef255784593f4bd7aa34d81843efaa6656b; 35824981e8034c28347256000a1069fb6386ffda; 333b3b2a4dfcec04e090c7c7da4b7301e1227351; a0c667b9cc71c00b5e4954feb639938b99549876; 0c8dacf66498f7e73d73ceb508dd1d2af81b680e; d57c0e232380909b5cc32e90d1c7f9571753495b; de78d1c114c15fb66f079a90b6fec3fb3705b462; 8e12eab51a3a19512e04d836e116cf309afd8c20; 6737531828e6b3203915d38b3d31384df32346b0; e855dda890e2fb939c5272be4c84ee63c8686f95; 43e05792d682a40f11386503f3c02e29559fa672; 64d42ff46bfec7ea32c40e94d45bc46229af3b89; 99d9aad924bf0710fba6585695149ecbebf208a7; fa275909293b2cb3b6be94e879c7895492b230e1; 5d36f01ae3441689cef50d0a5f86b801fa0b2fe5; c3f9b7ebcf5d3c97a42271e44c9f48cde4013d2f; 82de414075c585e019d940acaf3529f41dfabb5d; 0334da679e15f9d3dbad71448c080f56abc20660; 0f665e3415b021d03fa8963839fe4cde7e710ffe; 55557c0ebc71ff48881ef0c8531fc1bea4c28b5c; 0e2fe165dc627220cc711e1e03b8bea599112884; 5c6bd29d0e9f8708e7688bccbc3ca64400089ec3; a265e68c58a88f7fc5bf87512984486b656b80ff; 03cdd0c1da4fbf78efa947f240e2019c9d9120eb; 3a859b1afe59c0f36d40d156b241ab13303b46a8; 083123080c0ef964b38314b049e26c306c992321; 12ad1d83ec0c7525fcf928b63e43bf9df1d08ae7; be500bf42f9af503c2811ffdb2c6a48dc0b309f2; add09c99204ff8e4cf0f9ea09cef1902fd4b089a; 5ec5ee6e1be47e9d50b4d456294d1e158bc4fc73; 36df4573e4d1fbcf1caed1296942def2918ca834; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b,Microorganisms,8,
f74b8dfe6bc9f2b0659b4f1434fa8ea797f76cb0,Null Hypothesis Testing (I) - 5% Significance Level.,"In early 2015, the psychology journal Basic and Applied Social Psychology announced its ban on the use of ""Null Hypothesis Significance Testing Procedure"" (NHSTP), because of its invalidity. (1) Authors are now required to remove all vestiges of NHSTP, and any statement of ""significant"" differences. It is the first academic journal to take action against NHSTP, but the challenge of NHSTP began about 50 years ago. The issue was reported in the scientific magazines Nature (2) and Scientific American (3) The responses varied in the community of statistics and the community of research. There was heated debate because the ecosystem of the research community was being challenged. Colquhoun (4) concluded that ""if you use p = 0.05 to suggest that you have made a discovery, you will be wrong at least 30% of the time"". He proved his argument from several perspectives. He suggested that if we wanted to keep the false discovery rate below 5%, we need to insist ""three-sigma rules"" or p [less than or equal to] 0.001 and never use the word ""significant"". Imagine! Our knowledge pool will be contaminated rapidly by false discovery. Psychiatrists, and other medical professionals, should not tolerate such an enormous false-positive rate. In this article, the magic figure p [less than or equal to] 0.05 will be discussed. The uses, limitations, and interpretation of NHSTP will be further discussed in a later essay. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) was first described in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It advocates that decision-making in medical practice should be based on evidence derived from well-designed and conducted research. Most of this research is quantitative with conclusions based on the result of NHSTP. In almost all applications of NHSTPs, the magic figure p [less than or equal to] 0.05 has been used as the cut-off point to decide whether a conclusion is ""significant"" or not. You may ask: is p [less than or equal to] 0.05 an evidence-based figure? If it is not, how can EBM claim to be evidence-based? Some of our colleagues already question p [less than or equal to] 0.05 as an appropriate cutoff. It is difficult to imagine a scenario where 1 in 20 studies in medical research yield false discoveries. To answer this question, we can revisit the thoughts of one of the founders of NHSTP, Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher. In his book, Statistical Methods for Research Workers, (5) in a discussion of ""normal distribution"", he stated: ""The rapidity with which the probability falls off as the deviation increases is well shown in these tables (I & II). A deviation exceeding the standard deviation occurs about once in three trials. Twice the standard deviation is exceeded only about once in 22 trials, thrice the standard deviation only once in 370 trials, while Table II shows that to exceed the standard deviation six-fold would need nearly a thousand million trials. The value for which p = 0.05, or 1 in 20, is 1.96 or nearly 2; it is convenient to take this point as a limit in judging whether a deviation is to be considered significant or not. Deviations exceeding twice the standard deviation are thus formally regarded as significant."" Fisher defined deviation exceeding twice (but not one or thrice) the standard deviation (of normal distribution), which equals almost p = 0.05, as the value considered to be significant or not, because it is convenient. He provided no other rationale. Therefore, at the time of defining p = 0.05 as the level of significance, there was no logical reason or evidence to support such a decision. Unfortunately, although Fisher made some inconsistent comments about the choice of significance level later on in his book, we have adopted the value p = 0.05 as the level of significance for at least the last 80 years. In an earlier edition published in 1925, Statistical Methods for Research Workers, (6) Fisher implied p = 0.05 as the level of significance. At the end of Chapter VII ""Interclass Correlations and the Analysis of Variance"", he presented Table VI for the value of Z for F distribution. â€¦",2016,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kai-choi Wong"", ids = ""153936763"")",7b8941d5b6fae11d2de62ca370b2eb40e48c59ae,,East Asian archives of psychiatry : official journal of the Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists = Dong Ya jing shen ke xue zhi : Xianggang jing shen ke yi xue yuan qi kan,26 3,"

036a216fdb5c653e006014671afee8db0639b095,A Cross-Sectional Voxel-Based Morphometric Study of Age- and Sex-Related Changes in Gray Matter Volume in the Normal Aging Brain.,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of the study was to carry out a cross-sectional study of 124 cognitively normal Chinese adults using the voxel-based morphometry approach to delineate age-related changes in the gray matter volume of regions of interest (ROI) in the brain and further analyze their correlation with age.


METHODS
One hundred twenty-four cognitively normal adults were divided into the young age group, the middle age group, and the old age group. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging was performed with the Achieva 3.0 T system. Structural images were processed using VBM8 and SPM8. Regions of interest were obtained by WFU PickAtlas and all realigned images were spatially normalized.


RESULTS
Females showed significantly greater total gray matter volume than males (t = 4.81, P = 0.0000, false discovery rate corrected). Compared with young subjects, old-aged subjects showed extensive reduction in gray matter volumes in all ROIs examined except the occipital lobe. In young- and middle-aged subjects, female and male subjects showed significant difference in the right middle temporal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, left angular gyrus, right middle occipital lobe, left middle cingulate gyrus, and the pars triangularis of the right inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting an interaction between age and sex (P < 0.001, uncorrected). Logistic regression analysis revealed linear negative correlation between the total gray matter volume and age (R = 0.529, P < 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
Significant age-related differences are present in gray matter volume across multiple brain regions during aging. The VPM approach may provide an emerging paradigm in the normal aging brain that may help differentiate underlying normal neurobiological aging changes of specific brain regions from neurodegenerative impairments.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Fei Peng"", ids = ""36846055""); list(name = ""Lixin Wang"", ids = ""33195398""); list(name = ""Zuojun Geng"", ids = ""2623148""); list(name = ""Qingfeng Zhu"", ids = ""50736107""); list(name = ""Zhenhu Song"", ids = ""4249848"")",7632392d533a175600b98019aecb43820d68e3b6; 67da0b6a855c5486b1ef8f15f659ab9bd6193ef6; bfcc2836de46d8875edbcf31f0c9542e0f51b49f; e913f71d258656a8c67568b228611eb43db73d8d; ed841ec4f384c0bff38e7fb8c57aa08bb8302c35; ee74745657760dabe15bff0cca89e582ac93022d,834dc5906de74737094f392441680ab1e1294138; 2c38efba8596f052f0efd5b2f7048010fc7e6be3; e609cdbac646e4e40aa91209cb1e9327af5c5219; 2c53827ca52eedbf1e1499b37c27e82ae6cd2939; 99680ea3bc5898266d80f9736b1a7b1bd4071f50; 236cb915a1724c4b9ec3e53cfed64ce169358cda; cbf892774a5e440e38c15aab0123615f729bd6be; 4c9548cd174a89fb0d0f705ca48001572e343be9; e63c6bcdddc6a9c4e46459813a1f8f7addbdddd9; c7bf57fea1e645ce6497fcad9d585d4b8fb4d8e8; fc4e7b744d4ec1ec98dec95b1d415724eca02939; c6646484cf19abd9eeed321ce5abc9574ff8ae11; c8e2feb5b4f04b8d1ec554c1b25ee6e40cf04b2e; 6f7069b153f629e3ae4693c1bc55f5acf4cde359; 715e397578ca29862da8a80349591c8d8ef41409,Journal of computer assisted tomography,40 2,"

Using another characterization of power, we adapt Efron's ([2007] Ann Stat 35:1351-1377) empirical Bayes approach to post hoc power calculation to develop a method for prospective calculation of the ""identification power"" for individual genes. This is the probability that a gene with a given true degree of association with clinical outcome or state will be included in a set within which the FDR is controlled at a specified level. An example calculation using proportional hazards regression highlights the effects of large numbers of genes with little or no association on the identification power for individual genes with substantial association.",2012,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Michael Crager"", ids = ""4761644"")",2e02a91281ea5374e914dfa250ad3ade5c28f389; 24aa62e6c88d7979010658df998b0ba1281ddc6a,,Genetic epidemiology,36 8,"

eba6d7fe3a65a5f14ae20cfcf501b7ca4e464064,Genetic Overlap Between Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and Bipolar Disorder Implicates the MARK2 and VAC14 Genes,"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and bipolar disorder (BIP) are complex traits influenced by numerous common genetic variants, most of which remain to be detected. Clinical and epidemiological evidence suggest that AD and BIP are related. However, it is not established if this relation is of genetic origin. Here, we applied statistical methods based on the conditional false discovery rate (FDR) framework to detect genetic overlap between AD and BIP and utilized this overlap to increase the power to identify common genetic variants associated with either or both traits. Methods: We obtained genome wide association studies data from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project part 1 (17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls) and the Psychiatric Genetic Consortium Bipolar Disorder Working Group (20,352 BIP cases and 31,358 controls). We used conditional QQ-plots to assess overlap in common genetic variants between AD and BIP. We exploited the genetic overlap to re-rank test-statistics for AD and BIP and improve detection of genetic variants using the conditional FDR framework. Results: Conditional QQ-plots demonstrated a polygenic overlap between AD and BIP. Using conditional FDR, we identified one novel genomic locus associated with AD, and nine novel loci associated with BIP. Further, we identified two novel loci jointly associated with AD and BIP implicating the MARK2 gene (lead SNP rs10792421, conjunctional FDR = 0.030, same direction of effect) and the VAC14 gene (lead SNP rs11649476, conjunctional FDR = 0.022, opposite direction of effect). Conclusion: We found polygenic overlap between AD and BIP and identified novel loci for each trait and two jointly associated loci. Further studies should examine if the shared loci implicating the MARK2 and VAC14 genes could explain parts of the shared and distinct features of AD and BIP.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ole Kristian Drange"", ids = ""51262781""); list(name = ""Olav B.

965b435d9a11ec124e29b64b8587221b96b6b6a4,Characterization of EEG signals revealing covert cognition in the injured brain,"See Boly and Laureys (doi:10.1093/brain/awy080) for a scientific commentary on this article.Patients with severe brain injury are difficult to assess and frequently subject to misdiagnosis. 'Cognitive motor dissociation' is a term used to describe a subset of such patients with preserved cognition as detected with neuroimaging methods but not evident in behavioural assessments. Unlike the locked-in state, cognitive motor dissociation after severe brain injury is prominently marked by concomitant injuries across the cerebrum in addition to limited or no motoric function. In the present study, we sought to characterize the EEG signals used as indicators of cognition in patients with disorders of consciousness and examine their reliability for potential future use to re-establish communication. We compared EEG-based assessments to the results of using similar methods with functional MRI. Using power spectral density analysis to detect EEG evidence of task performance (Two Group Test, P â‰¤ 0.05, with false discovery rate correction), we found evidence of the capacity to follow commands in 21 of 28 patients with severe brain injury and all 15 healthy individuals studied. We found substantial variability in the temporal and spatial characteristics of significant EEG signals among the patients in contrast to only modest variation in these domains across healthy controls; the majority of healthy controls showed suppression of either 8-12 Hz 'alpha' or 13-40 Hz 'beta' power during task performance, or both. Nine of the 21 patients with EEG evidence of command-following also demonstrated functional MRI evidence of command-following. Nine of the patients with command-following capacity demonstrated by EEG showed no behavioural evidence of a communication channel as detected by a standardized behavioural assessment, the Coma Recovery Scale - Revised. We further examined the potential contributions of fluctuations in arousal that appeared to co-vary with some patients' ability to reliably generate EEG signals in response to command. Five of nine patients with statistically indeterminate responses to one task tested showed a positive response after accounting for variations in overall background state (as visualized in the qualitative shape of the power spectrum) and grouping of trial runs with similar background state characteristics. Our findings reveal signal variations of EEG responses in patients with severe brain injuries and provide insight into the underlying physiology of cognitive motor dissociation. These results can help guide future efforts aimed at re-establishment of communication in such patients who will need customization for brain-computer interfaces.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""William H Curley"", ids = ""49845403""); list(name = ""Peter B Forgacs"", ids = ""48261228""); list(name = ""Henning U.

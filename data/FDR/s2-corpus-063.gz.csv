c8c570efe3eb974c997da6982b8d610fdc2d2ed9,Pathways to smoking behaviours: biological insights from the Tobacco and Genetics Consortium meta-analysis,"By running gene and pathway analyses for several smoking behaviours in the Tobacco and Genetics Consortium (TAG) sample of 74â€‰053 individuals, 21 genes and several chains of biological pathways were implicated. Analyses were carried out using the HYbrid Set-based Test (HYST) as implemented in the Knowledge-based mining system for Genome-wide Genetic studies software. Fifteen genes are novel and were not detected with the single nucleotide polymorphism-based approach in the original TAG analysis. For quantity smoked, 14 genes passed the false discovery rate of 0.05 (corrected for multiple testing), with the top association signal located at the IREB2 gene (P=1.57E-37). Three genomic loci were significantly associated with ever smoked. The top signal is located at the noncoding antisense RNA transcript BDNF-AS (P=6.25E-07) on 11p14. The SLC25A21 gene (P=2.09E-08) yielded the top association signal in the analysis of smoking cessation. The 19q13 noncoding RNA locus exceeded the genome-wide significance in the analysis of age at initiation (P=1.33E-06). Pathways belonging to the Neuronal system pathways, harbouring the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes expressing the Î± (CHRNA 1-9), Î² (CHRNB 1-4), Î³, Î´ and É› subunits, yielded the smallest P-values in the pathway analysis of the quantity smoked (lowest P=4.90E-42). Additionally, pathways belonging to â€˜a subway map of cancer pathwaysâ€™ regulating the cell cycle, mitotic DNA replication, axon growth and synaptic plasticity were found significantly enriched for genetic variants in ever smokers relative to never smokers (lowest P=1.61E-07). In addition, these pathways were also significantly associated with the quantity smoked (lowest P=4.28E-17). Our results shed light on one of the world's leading causes of preventable death and open a path to potential therapeutic targets. These results are informative in decoding the biological bases of other disease traits, such as depression and cancers, with which smoking shares genetic vulnerabilities.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Camelia C MinicÄƒ"", ids = ""7005832""); list(name = ""Hamdi Mbarek"", ids = ""3789924""); list(name = ""RenÃ© Pool"", ids = ""47623651""); list(name = ""Conor V.

67d12888635b1efb17637515ed59e7ba30984ba8,Bladder cancer stage and outcome by array-based comparative genomic hybridization.,"PURPOSE
Bladder carcinogenesis is believed to follow alternative pathways of disease progression driven by an accumulation of genetic alterations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate associations between measures of genomic instability and bladder cancer clinical phenotype.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Genome-wide copy number profiles were obtained for 98 bladder tumors of diverse stages (29 pT(a), 14 pT1, 55 pT(2-4)) and grades (21 low-grade and 8 high-grade superficial tumors) by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Each array contained 2,464 bacterial artificial chromosome and P1 clones, providing an average resolution of 1.5 Mb across the genome. A total of 54 muscle-invasive cases had follow-up information available. Overall outcome analysis was done for patients with muscle-invasive tumors having ""good"" (alive >2 years) versus ""bad"" (dead in <2 years) prognosis.


RESULTS
Array CGH analysis showed significant increases in copy number alterations and genomic instability with increasing stage and with outcome. The fraction of genome altered (FGA) was significantly different between tumors of different stages (pT(a) versus pT1, P = 0.0003; pT(a) versus pT(2-4), P = 0.02; and pT1 versus pT(2-4), P = 0.03). Individual clones that differed significantly between different tumor stages were identified after adjustment for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate < 0.05). For muscle-invasive tumors, the FGA was associated with patient outcome (bad versus good prognosis patients, P = 0.002) and was identified as the only independent predictor of overall outcome based on a multivariate Cox proportional hazards method. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering separated ""good"" and ""bad"" prognosis muscle-invasive tumors into clusters that showed significant association with FGA and survival (Kaplan-Meier, P = 0.019). Supervised tumor classification (prediction analysis for microarrays) had a 71% classification success rate based on 102 unique clones.


CONCLUSIONS
Array-based CGH identified quantitative and qualitative differences in DNA copy number alterations at high resolution according to tumor stage and grade. Fraction genome altered was associated with worse outcome in muscle-invasive tumors, independent of other clinicopathologic parameters. Measures of genomic instability add independent power to outcome prediction of bladder tumors.",2005,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ekaterini Blaveri"", ids = ""2420998""); list(name = ""Jeremy L.

7ea8dae0a957b8c276f84f62ce8ef5bf8b732d21,Vascular transcriptional alterations produced by juvenile obesity in Ossabaw swine.,"We adopted a transcriptome-wide microarray analysis approach to determine the extent to which vascular gene expression is altered as a result of juvenile obesity and identify obesity-responsive mRNAs. We examined transcriptional profiles in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), perivascular fat adjacent to the LAD, and descending thoracic aorta between obese (n = 5) and lean (n = 6) juvenile Ossabaw pigs (age = 22 wk). Obesity was experimentally induced by feeding the animals a high-fat/high-fructose corn syrup/high-cholesterol diet for 16 wk. We found that expression of 189 vascular cell genes in the LAD and expression of 165 genes in the thoracic aorta were altered with juvenile obesity (false discovery rate â‰¤ 10%) with an overlap of only 28 genes between both arteries. Notably, a number of genes found to be markedly upregulated in the LAD of obese pigs are implicated in atherosclerosis, including ACP5, LYZ, CXCL14, APOE, PLA2G7, LGALS3, SPP1, ITGB2, CYBB, and P2RY12. Furthermore, pathway analysis revealed the induction of proinflammatory and pro-oxidant pathways with obesity primarily in the LAD. Gene expression in the LAD perivascular fat was minimally altered with juvenile obesity. Together, we provide new evidence that obesity produces artery-specific changes in pretranslational regulation with a clear upregulation of proatherogenic genes in the LAD. Our data may offer potential viable drug targets and mechanistic insights regarding the molecular precursors involved in the origins of overnutrition and obesity-associated vascular disease. In particular, our results suggest that the oxidized LDL/LOX-1/NF-ÎºB signaling axis may be involved in the early initiation of a juvenile obesity-induced proatherogenic coronary artery phenotype.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jaume Padilla"", ids = ""145202103""); list(name = ""Nathan T Jenkins"", ids = ""6538652""); list(name = ""Sewon Lee"", ids = ""2507175""); list(name = ""Hanrui Zhang"", ids = ""2858726""); list(name = ""Jian Cui"", ids = ""144001334""); list(name = ""Mozow Yusof Zuidema"", ids = ""5729522""); list(name = ""Cuihua Zhang"", ids = ""3068579""); list(name = ""Michael A Hill"", ids = ""145646777""); list(name = ""James W.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from pancreatic beta cells (BiPSCs) preferentially differentiate toward endocrine pancreas-like cells versus those from fibroblasts (FiPSCs). We interrogated genome-wide open chromatin in BiPSCs and FiPSCs via ATAC-seq and identified âˆ¼8.3k significant, differential open chromatin sites (DOCS) between the two iPSC subtypes (false discovery rate [FDR]Â < 0.05). DOCS where chromatin was more accessible in BiPSCs (Bi-DOCS) were significantly enriched for known regulators of endodermal development, including bivalent and weak enhancers, and FOXA2 binding sites (FDRÂ < 0.05). Bi-DOCS were associated with genes related to pancreas development and beta-cell function, including transcription factors mutated in monogenic diabetes (PDX1, NKX2-2, HNF1A; FDRÂ < 0.05). Moreover, Bi-DOCS correlated with enhanced gene expression in BiPSC-derived definitive endoderm and pancreatic progenitor cells.

4c7a1b281f3805f8f17f5010e5c65c25dec8656d,Identification of Cyclin D1-Dependent Genes by Gene Expression Profiling in MCL Cell Lines and Primary Cases.,"Abstract 3936 Poster Board III-872 Introduction The hallmark of MCL is overexpression of cyclin D1 due to the t(11;14). As cyclin D1 plays a central role in cell cycle regulation and influences the activity of several transcription factors, its overexpression is believed to initiate MCL lymphomagenesis. To dissect the transcriptional network regulated by cyclin D1, and to assess the relationship of cyclin D1 to genes comprising the recently described MCL proliferation signature, the consequences of cyclin D1 knockdown were analyzed by comparative gene expression profiling. Materials and Methods Four MCL cell lines, Granta 519, Jeko-1, Rec-1 and Z-138 were transduced with lentivirus containing the cyclin D1 shRNA or with empty lentivirus in triplicates. At day seven after infection, RNA was extracted and used for Gene Chip expression analysis (U133 Plus 2.0 arrays/ Affymetrix). After robust multi-array average (RMA) preprocessing, genes which were differentially expressed in all four cell lines were identified using BioConductor software. Validation was performed by correlating cyclin D1 levels with candidate gene expression by qRT-PCR in 10 primary MCL cases. Results To identify genes regulated by cyclin D1 in all four cell lines, statistical analysis applying a false discovery rate of 10% was performed, thereby accepting only genes with a >1,1 and 25. We identified 344 genes regulated after cyclin D1 knockdown (93 upregulated, 251 downregulated). Classification of the differentially expressed genes to biological processes revealed overrepresentation of genes involved in replication (23,0%), chromatin packaging and remodelling (12,5%), signal transduction (10,5%), metabolism (9,9%), transcription (9,6%) and cell cycle (6,4%). Of the 20 genes comprising the MCL proliferation signature (Rosenwald et al., Blood 2003), 10 were identified as cyclin D1 dependent. These genes were validated in MCL with high vs. low levels of cyclin D1 mRNA. Although there was a direct correlation between these 10 genes and cyclin D1 levels, it is notable that there was no correlation between the proliferation rate as assessed with MiB1 and the level of cyclin D1 expression Conclusions Comparative gene expression profiling before and after knockdown of cyclin D1 in MCL cell lines reveals a complex transcriptional network influenced by cyclin D1 expression levels. We also show that 10 of the 20 genes comprising the MCL proliferation signature are cyclin D1-dependent. These genes showed good correlation with cyclin D1 mRNA levels in primary cases, however, no correlation with proliferation rate was identified, suggesting cyclin D1-independent mechanisms governing proliferation in MCL. The identification of cyclin D1-dependent genes assists in our understanding of the contribution of cyclin D1 overexpression to the biology and clinical course of MCL.

13801ae09822cc1a98d9892571c8e6d5a9a8c01d,Test for conditional independence with application to conditional screening,"Abstract Measuring and testing conditional dependence are fundamental problems in statistics. Imposing mild conditions on Rosenblatt transformations (Rosenblatt, 1952), we establish an equivalence between the conditional and unconditional independence, which appears to be entirely irrelevant at the first glance. Such an equivalence allows us to convert the problem of testing conditional independence into the problem of testing unconditional independence. We further adopt the Blumâ€“Kieferâ€“Rosenblatt correlation (Blum etÂ al., 1961) to develop a test for conditional independence, which is powerful to capture nonlinear dependence and is robust to heavy-tailed errors. We obtain explicit forms for the asymptotic null distribution which involves no unknown tunings, rendering fast and easy implementation of our test for conditional independence. With this conditional independence test, we further propose a conditional screening method for high dimensional data to identify truly important covariates whose effects may vary with exposure variables. We use the false discovery rate to determine the screening cutoff. This screening approach possesses both the sure screening and the ranking consistency properties. We illustrate the finite sample performances through simulation studies and an application to the gene expression microarray dataset.",2020,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yeqing Zhou"", ids = ""47942791""); list(name = ""Jingyuan Liu"", ids = ""46700596""); list(name = ""Liping Zhu"", ids = ""46813209"")",,,J.

1e86ea987a16d052713b038d2844aab1cfe0e108,Neuropathologic correlates of regional brain volumes assessed with ex-vivo MRI,"Target Audience: Researchers in MRI of Alzheimerâ€™s disease and other age-related neuropathologies. Purpose: Brain atrophy is considered a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in clinical trials and biomarker studies. However, AD pathology in the elderly commonly coexists with other neuropathologies that may also lead to atrophy [1], and only a handful of studies have combined brain MR volumetry with measures of neuropathology obtained after death [2]. Furthermore, published structural MRIpathology investigations suffer from low numbers of participants, relatively long periods between imaging and death, and low level of detail in terms of the spatial patterns of brain atrophy. Thus, the relation between brain atrophy and age-related neuropathology is not well-established. Ex-vivo brain MRI overcomes several of the obstacles that complicate MRI-pathology investigations and can provide volumetric measurements that are linked to those collected in-vivo [3]. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to assess the neuropathologic correlates of regional brain volumes by combining ex-vivo MR volumetry and pathology information on a large community cohort of older persons. Methods: Cerebral hemispheres were obtained from 166 deceased participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project [4] and the Religious Orders Study [5], two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging. Demographic, clinical and neuropathologic information is included in the Table. All hemispheres were imaged ex-vivo, while immersed in 4% formaldehyde solution, using a 2D fast spin-echo sequence with multiple echo-times (TEs) on a 3T clinical MRI scanner [3]. A multi-atlas approach was used to segment ex-vivo brain MRI data into white and gray matter, and gray matter into 34 cortical and 8 subcortical regions [3]. All volumes were normalized by the height of the participants. Following ex-vivo MRI, hemispheres underwent neuropathologic assessment. The pathologies that were considered in analyses were: neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, gross and microscopic chronic infarcts, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy [1]. A composite measure of global AD pathology was created from counts of neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic and diffuse plaques. Multiple linear regression was used to investigate the link between the volume of each segmented brain region and age-related neuropathologies, controlling for age at death, sex, education, postmortem interval to fixation and to imaging. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results: Figure 1 shows brain regions with a significant negative association between their volume and the summary measure of AD pathology (p<0.05, FDR-corrected). A significant negative correlation was also shown between the volume of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, temporal pole, and superior frontal gyrus and hippocampal sclerosis (p<0.05, FDR-corrected) (figure not shown due to space limitations). No other pathologies considered here showed significant correlations with the volume of the segmented regions. Discussion and Conclusion: To our knowledge, this study is the largest MR volumetric-pathologic investigation in a community cohort to date, and the only MR volumetric-pathologic investigation assessing a high number of brain regions [2]. Consequently, the present study provides the most detailed information currently available on the spatial patterns of brain atrophy associated with agerelated neuropathologies. The findings of this work offer support to literature on the effects of AD pathology [6] and hippocampal sclerosis [7]. This is an ongoing investigation with a growing number of participants.

fe99fe0f11eb139acab1a4d587e9f03ff5b33230,Graphical models for de novo and pathway-based network prediction over multi-modal high-throughput biological data,"It is now a standard practice in the study of complex disease to perform many high-throughput -omic experiments (genome wide SNP, copy number, mRNA and miRNA expression) on the same set of patient samples. These multi-modal data should allow researchers to form a more complete, systems-level picture of a sample, but this is only possible if they have a suitable model for integrating the data. Due to the variety of data modalities and possible combinations of data, general, flexible integration methods that will be widely applicable in many settings are desirable. In this dissertation I will present my work using graphical models for de novo structure learning of both undirected and directed sparse graphs over a mixture of Gaussian and categorical variables. Using synthetic and biological data I will show that these models are useful for both variable selection and inference. Selecting the regularization parameters is an important challenge for these models so I will also cover stability based methods for efficiently setting these parameters, and for controlling the false discovery rate of edge predictions. I will also show results from a biological application to data from metastatic melanoma patients where our methods identified a PARP1 slice site variant that is predictive of response to chemotherapy. Finally, I present work incorporating miRNA into a pathway based graphical model called PARADIGM. This extension of the model allows us to study patient-specific changes in miRNA induced silencing in cancer.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Andrew J.

Predict False Discovery Rates of Screening","Microfluidic droplet-based screening of DNA-encoded one-bead-one-compound combinatorial libraries is a miniaturized, potentially widely distributable approach to small molecule discovery. In these screens, a microfluidic circuit distributes library beads into droplets of activity assay reagent, photochemically cleaves the compound from the bead, then incubates and sorts the droplets based on assay result for subsequent DNA sequencing-based hit compound structure elucidation. Pilot experimental studies revealed that Poisson statistics describe nearly all aspects of such screens, prompting the development of simulations to understand system behavior. Monte Carlo screening simulation data showed that increasing mean library sampling (Îµ), mean droplet occupancy, or library hit rate all increase the false discovery rate (FDR). Compounds identified as hits on k > 1 beads (the replicate k class) were much more likely to be authentic hits than singletons (k = 1), in agreement with previous findings. Here, we explain this observation by deriving an equation for authenticity, which reduces to the product of a library sampling bias term (exponential in k) and a sampling saturation term (exponential in Îµ) setting a threshold that the k-dependent bias must overcome. The equation thus quantitatively describes why each hit structure's FDR is based on its k class, and further predicts the feasibility of intentionally populating droplets with multiple library beads, assaying the micromixtures for function, and identifying the active members by statistical deconvolution.",2017,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrew B.

In order to make statements about the statistical significance of thousands of genes at once, it is essential to appropriately account for multiple tests. Multiple testing methods are hypothesis testing procedures designed to simultaneously test p > 1 hypotheses while controlling an error rate. Traditional approaches to the multiplicity problem are reviewed by [1]. More recent developments in the field include resampling methods [2], stepwise procedures, and the false discovery rate [3]. Standard practice in multiple testing with gene expression data is to use t-statistics as test statistics and to control a type I error rate under the permutation distribution. In this paper, we revisit the rationale behind such choices and suggest situations in which alternatives are more sensible. 2 Multiple Hypothesis Testing Procedures",2003,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Katherine S.

47cb9b163f6e3f87907f98984c8b0ee5e845a0e6,African American Specific Gene Panel Predictive of Poor Prostate Cancer Outcome.,"PURPOSE
Most prostate cancer in African American men lacks the ETS (E26 transforming specific) family fusion event (ETS-). We aimed to establish clinically relevant biomarkers in African American men by studying ETS dependent gene expression patterns to identified race specific genes predictive of outcomes.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Two multicenter cohorts of a total of 1,427 men were used for the discovery and validation (635 and 792 men, respectively) of race specific predictive biomarkers. We used false discovery rate adjusted q values to identify race and ETS dependent genes which were differentially expressed in African American men who experienced biochemical recurrence within 5 years. Principal component modeling along with survival analysis was done to assess the accuracy of the gene panel in predicting recurrence.


RESULTS
We identified 3,047 genes which were differentially expressed based on ETS status. Of these genes 362 were differentially expressed in a race specific manner (false discovery rate 0.025 or less). A total of 81 genes were race specific and over expressed in African American men who experienced biochemical recurrence. The final gene panel included APOD, BCL6, EMP1, MYADM, SRGN and TIMP3. These genes were associated with 5-year biochemical recurrence (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.27-3.06, p = 0.002) and they improved the predictive accuracy of clinicopathological variables only in African American men (60-month time dependent AUC 0.72).


CONCLUSIONS
In an effort to elucidate biological features associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness in African American men we identified ETS dependent biomarkers predicting early onset biochemical recurrence only in African American men.

c640d7ce38f4b7f14bca36f94b3d6b69bbb28dad,Mapping Transcription Factor Networks By Comparing Tf Binding Locations To Tf Perturbation Responses,"Background A transcription-factor (TF) network map indicates the direct, functional targets of each TF -- the genes it regulates by binding to their cis-regulatory DNA. Data on the genomic binding locations of each TF and the transcriptional responses to perturbations of its activity, such as overexpressing it, could support TF network mapping. Systematic data sets of both types exist for yeast and for human K562 and HEK293 cells. Results In previous data, most TF binding sites appear to be non-functional, so one cannot take the genes in whose promoters a TF binds as its direct, functional (DF) targets. Taking the genes that are both bound by a TF and responsive to a perturbation of it as its DF targets (intersection algorithm) is also not safe, as we show by deriving a new lower bound on the expected false discovery rate of the intersection algorithm. When there are many non-functional binding sites and many indirect targets, non-functional sites are expected to occur in the cis-regulatory DNA of indirect targets by chance. Dual threshold optimization, a new method for setting significance thresholds on binding and response data, improves the intersection algorithm, as does post-processing perturbation-response data with NetProphet 2.0. A comprehensive new data set measuring the transcriptional response shortly after inducing overexpression of a TF also helps, as does transposon calling cards, a new method for identifying TF binding locations. Conclusions The combination of dual threshold optimization and NetProphet greatly expands the high-confidence TF network map in both yeast and human. In yeast, measuring the response shortly after inducing TF overexpression and measuring binding locations by using transposon calling cards improve the network synergistically.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Yiming Kang"", ids = ""32734131""); list(name = ""N.

575a331789f0ba65608e997d5f2e31d91c0ce608,Levodopa and dopamine dynamics in Parkinsonâ€™s disease metabolomics,"Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Metabolomics is a powerful tool that can be used to screen for potential biomarkers, exogenous toxicants, and metabolic network changes associated with disease states. Here, we used high-resolution metabolomics to compare over 10,000 plasma metabolic features from older adults with and without PD in an untargeted approach. We performed a network analysis that demonstrates that the presence of the PD drug levodopa influences variation observed between PD and control patients. Metabolome wide association studies and discrimination analysis identified significant differentiation in the metabolomics profile of older adults with and without PD. Notably, 15 metabolic features (ten of which we putatively identified) differed between PD and control adults with p < 0.05 and a corrected false discovery rate less than 20%. Furthermore, 13 metabolic networks were identified to be functionally different between PD and non-PD patients. Lastly, the dopaminergic toxic intermediate DOPAL differed between PD and non-PD populations, which supports the dopaminergic sequestration model of PD. These individual metabolites and metabolic networks have been implicated in past PD pathogenesis models, including the beta-carboline harmalol and the glycosphingolipid metabolism pathway including the ganglioside GM2. We recommend that future studies take into account the confounding effects of levodopa in metabolomic analyses of disease versus control patients, and encourage validation of several promising metabolic markers of PD.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Rachel C.

1ee1c75d7e1ac2dda33de898a71b6f2245bb9cc1,An effect size filter improves the reproducibility in spectral counting-based comparative proteomics.,"UNLABELLED
The microarray community has shown that the low reproducibility observed in gene expression-based biomarker discovery studies is partially due to relying solely on p-values to get the lists of differentially expressed genes. Their conclusions recommended complementing the p-value cutoff with the use of effect-size criteria. The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of such an effect-size filter on spectral counting-based comparative proteomic analysis. The results proved that the filter increased the number of true positives and decreased the number of false positives and the false discovery rate of the dataset. These results were confirmed by simulation experiments where the effect size filter was used to evaluate systematically variable fractions of differentially expressed proteins. Our results suggest that relaxing the p-value cut-off followed by a post-test filter based on effect size and signal level thresholds can increase the reproducibility of statistical results obtained in comparative proteomic analysis. Based on our work, we recommend using a filter consisting of a minimum absolute log2 fold change of 0.8 and a minimum signal of 2-4 SpC on the most abundant condition for the general practice of comparative proteomics. The implementation of feature filtering approaches could improve proteomic biomarker discovery initiatives by increasing the reproducibility of the results obtained among independent laboratories and MS platforms.


BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Quality control analysis of microarray-based gene expression studies pointed out that the low reproducibility observed in the lists of differentially expressed genes could be partially attributed to the fact that these lists are generated relying solely on p-values. Our study has established that the implementation of an effect size post-test filter improves the statistical results of spectral count-based quantitative proteomics. The results proved that the filter increased the number of true positives whereas decreased the false positives and the false discovery rate of the datasets. The results presented here prove that a post-test filter applying a reasonable effect size and signal level thresholds helps to increase the reproducibility of statistical results in comparative proteomic analysis. Furthermore, the implementation of feature filtering approaches could improve proteomic biomarker discovery initiatives by increasing the reproducibility of results obtained among independent laboratories and MS platforms.

37903f574478494afb96a974da293bcdfd9293b3,Structure identification in high-resolution transmission electron microscopic images: an example on graphene.,"A connection between microscopic structure and macroscopic properties is expected for almost all material systems. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy is a technique offering insight into the atomic structure, but the analysis of large image series can be time consuming. The present work describes a method to automatically estimate the atomic structure in two-dimensional materials. As an example graphene is chosen, in which the positions of the carbon atoms are reconstructed. Lattice parameters are extracted in the frequency domain and an initial atom positioning is estimated. Next, a plausible neighborhood structure is estimated. Finally, atom positions are adjusted by simulation of a Markov random field model, integrating image evidence and the strong geometric prior. A pristine sample with high regularity and a sample with an induced hole are analyzed. False discovery rate-controlled large-scale simultaneous hypothesis testing is used as a statistical framework for interpretation of results. The first sample yields, as expected, a homogeneous distribution of carbon-carbon (C-C) bond lengths. The second sample exhibits regions of shorter C-C bond lengths with a preferred orientation, suggesting either strain in the structure or a buckling of the graphene sheet. The precision of the method is demonstrated on simulated model structures and by its application to multiple exposures of the two graphene samples.",2014,Materials Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jacob S.

ca64e5184b009f2ae821ecb0be4b291e0623951e,Clinical Utility of Berlin Questionnaire in Comparison to Polysomnography in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea.,"The aim of this study was to assess the utility of the Berlin questionnaire (BQ) in adult patients at high risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study consisted of 64 patients recruited for the polysomnography diagnostics of sleep respiratory disturbances. The anthropometric assessment included body weight, height, and body mass index (BMI), all related to the risk of OSA. The BQ consisted of the following three categories: 1 - snoring, 2 - daytime somnolence, and 3 - hypertension. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were evaluated. Likelihood ratio was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy. We found that patients were, on average obese; the mean BMI amounted to 31.9 Â± 6.0 kg/m2. Polysomnography identified OSA in 73.4% of patients (AHI >5), where the BQ categorized 87.5% of patients at high risk of OSA. Sensitivity of the BQ was 87.2%, specificity 11.8%, PPV 73.2%, and NPV 25.0%. Diagnostic accuracy assessed by the likelihood ratio had a value of 1.00. The BQ had a false discovery rate of 31.2% and misclassification rate of 32.8%.

ffb9d577b5a424dfa86d7e7f8381857822120798,What proportion of declared QTL in plants are false?,"The false discovery rate (FDR) is the probability that a quantitative trait locus (QTL) is false, given that a QTL has been declared. A misconception in QTL mapping is that the FDR is equal to the comparison-wise significance level, Î±C. The objective of this simulation study was to determine the FDR in an F2 mapping population, given different numbers of QTL, population sizes, and trait heritabilities. Markers linked to QTL were detected by multiple regression of phenotype on marker genotype. Phenotypic selection and marker-based recurrent selection were compared. The FDR increased as Î±C increased. Notably, the FDR was often 10â€“30 times higher than the Î±C level used. Regardless of the number of QTL, heritability, or size of the genome, the FDR was â‰¤0.01 when Î±C was 0.0001. The FDR increased to 0.82 when Î±C was 0.05, heritability was low, and only one QTL controlled the trait. An Î±C of 0.05 led to a low FDR when many QTL (30 or 100) controlled the trait, but this lower FDR was accompanied by a diminished power to detect QTL. Larger mapping populations led to both lower a FDR and increased power. Relaxed significance levels of Î±C=0.1 or 0.2 led to the largest responses to marker-based recurrent selection, despite the high FDR. To prevent false QTL from confusing the literature and databases, a detected QTL should, in general, be reported as a QTL only if it was identified at a stringent significance level, e.g., Î±Câ‰…0.0001.",2004,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rex Bernardo"", ids = ""152675903"")",ccbb9147ae0c78fc430567c2bda1ea44fe56ad07; 9fa610ce947109a15e45ac5e6ca7152746a482f1; eb4d2f1d7e8c811c09b62fba2638be2484b4a8f7; 4c7905ac1404eea68276ac987e5e33816d4bbc4a; 7a668f47f81cbde77542e23a2f77a36d84cf79a3; 210b5c16dedef6f74f9fc608db7262bc5085f0f4; 72957e6821d3276d3435b321f15cb703edd54b70; 91ffcc41db7ec16dd08a0c8213c074d8de4cc1bb; cfdd6b3c27f31244f9357d8f4da0d830243672d8; 89f521117519d2529c5bac025810ab0e3bfeb300; 3b99ac8094aa7b0a5fcd10e223c93acd67224c10; c782137c7031a51b82103ae9fc15d865e4054132; 369bd0275630c21e9bc179f71e653b3bae79eb03; 9901ed8fca06cacd6d6545dc703e890f558a8d60; 9c016fca0d60c828e900a3fbdd29c4125c72baf3; 2c72da2c5232809f6b008d3c06e5d01ee0d85725; b9379ed8194b39bb0297551eaa570744562610e8; ea477a67b09a1c6c90ac908d3ce9de7b3a4dabcc; 4fa4f386723743069ad42e2ede5443beea92343a; c87a490d57c19a250d26dad50101fe552afdd830; 89061c2bba3519cd28a65164ec8a9a75b1dd9988; b0212677f221d94bc353582798a203935cad3a77; 93871794ea518a7107092ad57ca54e3bb89bc4a8; 10d0314b9b20b545ab66e2308d78634117fb8a78; 653bdf88f3884766f678c300e9cd3e978cdf38c3; aa7b113a64cdc182a59a677ad224ecfb5165e661; 1377fa64f32c87603f8d24784559e58b14e78edb; a89df8fd6b158f174e9411677a34d09d5255df90; 64433251dd1c8a7a78047cce95fd4a467c3a9ee2; b000b256624c2f95a2a6dc57d1fd46f55720d2b0; 153770e107eff918fb5b430c583e2585a347947f; 9299282e19670fc9ee1240b3ab0d24b090e4f19d; ea5944decd0828d734edb94bba985a6db202c129; 1c4caa7a25bb8a303be47bdbc9f2e049dbb6c672; b1feb15dcd29f0f659d9e450e32f2aeb09367ea5; 044950fed0fde6051f22337fba9db8bb17d3f2e8; 349429a73ad0b3095ba2cec7f981751c3c6f23fa; 913ec33d0d1c47b1d852f561f445ab3891370c69; 18b170035425093f786ceaceead56c0833887d3f; 1e70bd6e0c366f08eb204c1f4f837381cf22ba4d; 82e76123abd63152a8c46e1fe1c8b4a3f1f069e5; 2fb76f298605630768b1df59d1059280db67b418; e9f4095135aeef7fda84da5c1ece9521a39403a3; c91513dcaa33dea68880b4c9e47e0e1008228130; 9b3de79d3d30e23b0cfbc75b0148197921132039; 1a13f1a22d106e118f54da122ff0f95b21b74a4d; c43f2bda074defe21b23a4775305fe0916749018; ebeabc586b11e7d004872af5ce3cec48fae3436d; a9b588803315d93882007b894b53003563067408; 4ea46e63f3f8b03ec8bbfec29c7556e88e01b40e; 419b5cd24e44e2a9cd08ed6d8e025f9fb3a16a08; 3de429430ef7bbb293fd9596b5b2af1af0328f5c; a3ab989a50ff899f6061a6309bfa9059f8308d68; 2cc38c5438ccdb9f73aa47474ebe89bc4c4772c3,37fc47e812126324242e2975f464fc7fdba3df9e; 3a6ba1ed032cc441d106ce326ff38a1d581b4105; 5a7002735c85cb14904c8689b04bf33f7babb8f9; da1126f8630a2c9d6c0e03559832f959e7c02d90; 4e7502660cf648550ea4a3c5b74d9880e75c72c3; efae7e3a8c47024a00ab46d95ca442f635b4e16f; 6d10752cff2c14005060125bdf3f91026bc742ee; 433eb3f2260e7e27245ff969aa652edb90255bbe; 63e7754137a22a0e682dc35d9b5aff7d056036c3; 26e614f011e62d6985d82b809b43de0bada9729d; 313beef951cb59679a859381c45aebffc83e33fe; d78f58e6170d1b4fab239108e7c810f7ab610a00; 89bf2a378d938e88cb5c0d68ac2b2a525d856cf1; 77a6180db9e00eb371b9ec9b64d1839cda23be61; e3d531fcf4ef7815e41958293ee7734428610a0a; 06f79b29d4907711d3c66dc052523879af56e50f; 4f3d6ea25f65aef7f8353a0bd484a60a5dc760c6; 7018a3e16b5aceb8cca073f43202e548be404af6; dd94b044d72e1f9460e7658b273fa03972334da4; 5204f6fd9f218db236ea4022f51b01715e7920c8; 1e944bc1a57f816c6e1bd5e48735ab5b14e8e50e; d3cafebd0650c0e27cf58f80c6cbd99d5cb2c75a; 83155b91272fa7eb7e7b65a0905e4a7265ba35e4; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; bb4fe45dd8cffc40537b32de1409783379469356,Theoretical and Applied Genetics,109,419-424
94c63603f8299a8bce3034d1daed2bdecf66e9ce,The influence of cancer tissue sampling on the identification of cancer characteristics,"Cancer tissue sampling affects the identification of cancer characteristics. We aimed to clarify the source of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in macro-dissected cancer tissue and develop a robust prognostic signature against the effects of tissue sampling. For estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer patients, we identified DEGs in macro-dissected cancer tissues, malignant epithelial cells and stromal cells, defined as Macro-Dissected-DEGs, Epithelial-DEGs and Stromal-DEGs, respectively. Comparing Epithelial-DEGs to Stromal-DEGs (false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰10%), 86% of the overlapping genes exhibited consistent dysregulation (defined as Consistent-DEGs), and the other 14% of genes were dysregulated inconsistently (defined as Inconsistent-DEGs). The consistency score of dysregulation directions between Macro-Dissected-DEGs and Consistent-DEGs was 91% (P-valueâ€‰<â€‰2.2â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-16), binomial test), whereas the score was only 52% between Macro-Dissected-DEGs and Inconsistent-DEGs (P-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.9, binomial test). Among the gene ontology (GO) terms significantly enriched in Macro-Dissected-DEGs (FDRâ€‰<â€‰10%), 18 immune-related terms were enriched in Inconsistent-DEGs. DEGs associated with proliferation could reflect common changes of malignant epithelial and stromal cells; DEGs associated with immune functions are sensitive to the percentage of malignant epithelial cells in macro-dissected tissues. A prognostic signature which was insensitive to the cellular composition of macro-dissected tissues was developed and validated for ER+ breast patients.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hui lian Xu"", ids = ""143815771""); list(name = ""X.

b32fc8ddaf96faa64139153e5ef7a3b4df0c0434,Transcriptomic behavior of genes associated with chromosome 21 aneuploidies in early embryo development.,"OBJECTIVE
To analyze how chromosome 21 (HSA21) ploidy affects global gene expression of early human blastocysts.


DESIGN
Prospective study.


SETTING
University-affiliated inÂ vitro fertilization clinic.


PATIENT(S)
A total of 26 high-quality donated embryos from inÂ vitro fertilization (IVF) patients: trisomy 21 (n = 8), monosomy 21 (nÂ =Â 10), and euploid (n = 8) blastocysts.


INTERVENTION(S)
None.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)
Blastocyst transcriptome changes and its associated functions.


RESULT(S)
Trisomy 21, monosomy 21, and euploid blastocysts were classified by comparative genomic hybridization. The global transcriptome of whole blastocysts was analyzed with small cell number RNA sequencing, and they were compared to understand the gene expression behavior at early development and its implications for embryo implantation. We identified 1,232 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate <0.05) in monosomy 21 compared with euploid blastocysts associated with dysregulated functions in embryo development as the Rap1 signaling pathway. Curiously, Down syndrome in early development revealed fewer transcriptomic changes than expected. In addition, Down syndrome gene expression in neonates, children, and adults revealed that the number of deregulated genes increases across life stages from blastocysts to adults, suggesting a potential dosage-compensation mechanism for human chromosomeÂ 21.


CONCLUSION(S)
At the transcriptomic level, early development in Down syndrome is mainly dosage compensated. However, monosomy 21 is strongly transcriptionally affected because early development involving main functions is associated with embryo implantation.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Imma Sanchez-Ribas"", ids = ""1435592450""); list(name = ""Patricia DÃ­az-Gimeno"", ids = ""1398216250""); list(name = ""Patricia SebastiÃ¡n-LeÃ³n"", ids = ""1423249994""); list(name = ""Amparo Mercader"", ids = ""2491942""); list(name = ""Alicia QuiÃ±onero"", ids = ""5131878""); list(name = ""AgustÃ­n Ballesteros"", ids = ""121835913""); list(name = ""Antonio Pellicer"", ids = ""144806735""); list(name = ""Francisco DomÃ­nguez"", ids = ""50044028"")",01a478d7c53e823fd675f3c32be3f95c9ec14ab4; 240f92b4aaa8706cd96d224f660b08c0f0e2816e,,Fertility and sterility,111 5,"

462b10f2fbf3027cb030de069093a1e7267b77b9,ProSpect: An R Package for Analyzing SELDI Measurements Identifying Protein Biomarkers,"Protein expression profiling is a multidisciplinary research field which promises success for early cancer detection and monitoring of this widespread disease. The surface enhanced laser desorption and ionization (SELDI) is a mass spectrometry method and one of two widely used techniques for protein biomarker discovery in cancer research. There are several algorithms for signal detection in mass spectra but they are known to have poor specificity and sensitivity. Scientists have to review the analyzed mass spectra manually which is time consuming and error prone. Therefore, algorithms with improved specificity are urgently needed. We aimed to develop a peak detection method with much better specificity than the standard methods. 
 
The proposed peak algorithm is divided into three steps: (1) data import and preparation, (2) signal detection by using an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and the required F-statistics, and (3) classification of the computed peak cluster as significant based on the false discovery rate (FDR) specified by the user. 
 
The proposed method offers a significantly reduced preprocessing time of SELDI spectra, especially for large studies. 
 
The developed algorithms are implemented in R and available as open source packages ProSpect, rsmooth, and ProSpectGUI. The software implementation aims a high error tolerance and an easy handling for user which are unfamiliar with the statistical software R. Furthermore, the modular software design allows the simple extension and adaptation of the available code basis in the further development of the software.",2005,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Andreas Quandt"", ids = ""34662447""); list(name = ""Alexander Ploner"", ids = ""47353253""); list(name = ""Chuen Seng Tan"", ids = ""49409304""); list(name = ""Janne LehtiÃ¶"", ids = ""2006594""); list(name = ""Yudi Pawitan"", ids = ""2445755"")",,,,,140-150
6625d40a5003ad497ab657a1b152fdc66a56c425,Influence of previous participation in physical activity on its perceptions among tertiary institution students,"Physical inactivity is one of the leading causes of the major non-communicable diseases, which contribute substantially to the global burden of diseases, death and disability. The burden of mortality, morbidity and disability attributable to non-communicable diseases is currently greatest and is continually growing in the developing countries. Most declines in physical activity (PA) occur during the transition period when a person goes from high school to College or University. The objectives of this study were to identify perceived benefits of and barriers to PA and determine whether previous participation in PA does have an influence on these perceptions. A cross- sectional and descriptive study with quantitative design was conducted. Five hundred (500) tertiary institution students were randomly sampled from purposively selected departments and classes at each of the five government educational tertiary institutions in Rwanda. A pre-coded self-administered questionnaire with a small number of open-ended questions was administered to the students. A response rate of 425 (85%) was obtained. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data, by means of SAS version 8 software. Frequencies and percentages for mean score values with standard deviations for each perception variable were descriptively obtained. False Discovery Rate (FDR) at 5% for multiple test adjustment and Spearman's correlation (r) tests were used to identify the significant influence of previous participation on perceptions. More than 70% students were not participating in PA at tertiary level. Psychological benefits of PA were some of the most important perceived benefits cited by the students. Most of the important barriers cited concerned equipment and time constraints to exercising. Associations were found between previous participation and the current perceptions of PA. The findings of this study demonstrate that previous participation can influence perceptions of PA among the students. Physical activity promotion programmes should consider the role of these factors which should be emphasised from childhood.

To understand the underlying mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction in cancer, we examined cardiac function, protein synthesis, mitochondrial function and gene expression in a model of heart failure in mice injected with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC1) cells.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Seven week-old C57BL/J6 male and female mice were injected with LLC1 cells or vehicle. Cardiac ejection fraction, ventricular wall and septal thickness were reduced in male, but not female, tumor-bearing mice compared to vehicle-injected control mice. Cardiac protein synthesis was reduced in tumor-bearing male mice compared to control mice (p = 0.025). Aspect ratio and form factor of cardiac mitochondria from the tumor-bearing mice were increased compared control mice (p = 0.042 and p = 0.0032, respectively) indicating a more fused mitochondrial network in the hearts of tumor-bearing mice. In cultured cardiomyocytes maximal oxygen consumption and mitochondrial reserve capacity were reduced in cells exposed to tumor cell-conditioned medium compared to non-conditioned medium (p = 0.0059, p = 0.0010). Whole transcriptome sequencing of cardiac ventricular muscle from tumor-bearing vs. control mice showed altered expression of 1648 RNA transcripts with a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. Of these, 54 RNA transcripts were reduced â‰¤ 0.5 fold, and 3 RNA transcripts were increased by â‰¥1.5-fold in tumor-bearing mouse heart compared to control. Notably, the expression of mRNAs for apelin (Apln), the apelin receptor (Aplnr), the N-myc proto-oncogene, early growth protein (Egr1), and the transcription factor Sox9 were reduced by >50%, whereas the mRNA for growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, beta (Gadd45b) is increased >2-fold, in ventricular tissue from tumor-bearing mice compared to control mice.


CONCLUSIONS
Lung tumor cells induce heart failure in male mice in association with reduced protein synthesis, mitochondrial function, and the expression of the mRNAs for inotropic and growth factors.

c6e52122d20528d35078b6e06eedc4135b34eb0e,A Single-Subject Method to Detect Pathways Enriched With Alternatively Spliced Genes,"RNA-Sequencing data offers an opportunity to enable precision medicine, but most methods rely on gene expression alone. To date, no methodology exists to identify and interpret alternative splicing patterns within pathways for an individual patient. This study develops methodology and conducts computational experiments to test the hypothesis that pathway aggregation of subject-specific alternatively spliced genes (ASGs) can inform upon disease mechanisms and predict survival. We propose the N-of-1-pathways Alternatively Spliced (N1PAS) method that takes an individual patient's paired-sample RNA-Seq isoform expression data (e.g., tumor vs. non-tumor, before-treatment vs. during-therapy) and pathway annotations as inputs. N1PAS quantifies the degree of alternative splicing via Hellinger distances followed by two-stage clustering to determine pathway enrichment. We provide a clinically relevant ""odds ratio"" along with statistical significance to quantify pathway enrichment. We validate our method in clinical samples and find that our method selects relevant pathways (p < 0.05 in 4/6 data sets). Extensive Monte Carlo studies show N1PAS powerfully detects pathway enrichment of ASGs while adequately controlling false discovery rates. Importantly, our studies also unveil highly heterogeneous single-subject alternative splicing patterns that cohort-based approaches overlook. Finally, we apply our patient-specific results to predict cancer survival (FDR < 20%) while providing diagnostics in pursuit of translating transcriptome data into clinically actionable information.

Of particular interest are error rates based on the proportion g (V(n),S(n)) = V(n) /(V(n) + S(n)) of Type I errors among the rejected hypotheses, such as the false discovery rate (FDR), FDR = E [V(n) /(V(n) + S(n))]. The proposed procedures offer several advantages over existing methods. They provide Type I error control for general data generating distributions, with arbitrary dependence structures among variables. Gains in power are achieved by deriving rejection regions based on guessed sets of true null hypotheses and null test statistics randomly sampled from joint distributions that account for the dependence structure of the data. The Type I error and power properties of an FDR-controlling version of the resampling-based empirical Bayes approach are investigated and compared to those of widely-used FDR-controlling linear step-up procedures in a simulation study. The Type I error and power trade-off achieved by the empirical Bayes procedures under a variety of testing scenarios allows this approach to be competitive with or outperform the Storey and Tibshirani (2003) linear step-up procedure, as an alternative to the classical Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) procedure.",2008,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sandrine Dudoit"", ids = ""2225350""); list(name = ""Houston N.

Design: Retrospective study of HDL function measured in 2 ways in HIV-1â€“infected men with low overall CVD risk and healthy men with no known CVD risk matched by race to the HIV-1â€“infected participants. Methods: We examined patient-level factors associated with 2 different measures of HDL dysfunction: reduced antioxidant function (oxidized HDL, HDLox) and reduced HDL-apoA-I exchange (HAE), a measure of HDL remodeling, in the HIV infected and control men. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression analyses were used adjusting for false discovery rate, age, race, body mass index (BMI), CD4 count, viremia, CVD risk, smoking, lipids, apoA-I, and albumin. Results: In multivariate analysis among HIV-1â€“infected men (n = 166) (median age 45 years, CD4 T-cell count 505 cells/mm3, 30.1% were viremic), higher BMI, lower apoA-I, and lower albumin were among the most notable correlates of higher HDLox and lower HAE (P < 0.05). In HIV-1 uninfected participants, lower albumin and higher BMI were associated with lower HAE and higher HDLox, respectively (P â©½ 0.05). HDLox was inversely related to HAE in HIV-1â€“infected individuals (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Increased HDLox correlates with reduced HAE in chronic HIV-1 infection. Higher BMI, lower apoA-I, and albumin were identified as factors associated with HDL dysfunction in chronic HIV-1 infection using 2 independent methods.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Theodoros Kelesidis"", ids = ""6212393""); list(name = ""Michael N Oda"", ids = ""5931405""); list(name = ""Mark S.

Rationale: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of breast cancer have identified 71 risk alleles, majority of which are located in intergenic or intronic regions. We used a network medicine approach to associate breast cancer risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with transcript abundance in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) breast tissue. Identification of expression quantitative loci (eQTLs) may help to better understand the regulatory mechanisms by which these risk variants influence breast cancer susceptibility.

Method: We identified invasive postmenopausal breast cancer cases in the Nursesâ€™ Health Study (NHS) diagnosed from 1990-2004 with GWAS data and sufficient RNA for expression profiling in breast tumor and normal adjacent breast tissue. RNA was extracted using the Qiagen AllPrep RNA isolation kit, amplified using the NuGen Ovation FFPE WTA kit, and profiled using the Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array (HTA 3.0v1). The HTA includes 6,892,960 features for measuring gene expression, alternative splicing, coding SNPs, and noncoding transcripts. After filtering and removing probes with a low dynamic range in our samples, we included 25,000 gene expression probes in our QTL analyses. We mapped these probes to genes using hg19.

Results: Analyses were conducted separately for 376 breast tumor and 274 normal adjacent samples. We conducted quality control analyses, corrected for assay plate-to-plate variation and included patient's age at diagnosis and year of diagnosis as covariates in the multivariate linear regression model. We identified 11 trans eQTLs in normal adjacent breast tissue, 11 trans eQTLs in estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast tumor samples, and 12 trans eQTLs in ER- breast tumor samples (permutation adjusted p-value<0.05). We also developed a new method, functional quantitative trait loci (fQTL) analysis, to gain additional pathway insight into genetic associations important in breast cancer. In the fQTL analysis we tested for the association between SNPs and the expression of gene functional classes and pathways, evaluating the hypothesis that SNPs may also be associated with regulation of processes in addition to individual genes. Using a cutoff of false discovery rate <10%, we identified 2 SNPs associated with 2 Gene Ontology Molecular Functions in normal adjacent breast tissue, 1 SNP associated with 5 Molecular Functions in ER- tumor samples but no significant SNP associations in ER+ tumor samples. Integrated eQTL and fQTL analyses and variant annotation are ongoing.

Conclusion: In summary, our results provide functional insights on the underlying biology of loci identified in breast cancer GWAS in the specimen type that is most impactful in translation to clinical practice. Identification of gene transcripts that can be measured in FFPE tissue and are associated with breast cancer risk loci is critical in understanding the mechanism by which these variants affect risk and mediate disease processes.

fafbff14c53f253db87d08a29e06e9bd7af2d8c0,Pharmacovigilance data mining with methods based on false discovery rates: a comparative simulation study.,"The early detection of adverse reactions caused by drugs that are already on the market is the prime concern of pharmacovigilance efforts; the methods in use for postmarketing surveillance are aimed at detecting signals pointing to potential safety concerns, on the basis of reports from health-care providers and from information available in various databases. Signal detection methods based on the estimation of false discovery rate (FDR) have recently been proposed. They address the limitation of arbitrary detection thresholds of the automatic methods in current use, including those last updated by the US Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization's Uppsala Monitoring Centre. We used two simulation procedures to compare the false-positive performances for three current methods: the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the information component (IC), the gamma Poisson shrinkage (GPS), and also for two FDR-based methods derived from the GPS model and Fisher's test. Large differences in FDR rates were associated with the signal-detection methods currently in use. These differences ranged from 0.01 to 12% in an analysis that was restricted to signals with at least three reports. The numbers of signals generated were also highly variable. Among fixed-size lists of signals, the FDR was lowered when the FDR-based approaches were used. Overall, the outcomes in both simulation studies suggest that improvement in effectiveness can be expected from use of the FDR-based GPS method.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ibrahimi Ahmed"", ids = ""121469972""); list(name = ""Frantz Thiessard"", ids = ""2188028""); list(name = ""Ghada Miremont-SalamÃ©"", ids = ""1398125379""); list(name = ""Bernard BÃ©gaud"", ids = ""3050322""); list(name = ""Pascale Tubert-Bitter"", ids = ""1398734189"")",18c1f2ffa128488bdce312e8d188b839c3d66b6c; 7b59b9898d07b68e8d0147a2004a6433a536b25a; ce96bb13c2eec47e375574709b38820c38bf9626; b1b08d3c00098cc58a78f7aa27cab577ca08443e; 536293b2a3a7348e3264dfd079b5094679dd588d; b20f1e86a44acef72735c99bbed5b10a643f222f; 3e7ad7d1079bb21634e809072e5dc3153485d1fd; 329d3fa52d6152e07515ce0367793617b804bfa7; 23a1ec9580b36b842e7d240aa05a6c8ce28e07be; 9658dd42f6b8c702d205dc4589ecdb57e298749b; af50e745422eda4f880943c614fd17f2428061ba; 27b5fb7933f6986fba99987dd5680bb07b9af9e4; eb289c307860cc4e608b0064c024827a31d52d5f; 3a9433ea1de084873edb866a96cd5e80c906e31e; 8d393955a5bb1451fcc17f1619bcc1d1d62a806d; 7e2a46a2b377e31c28776fe09e0089ba396db01d; 432dfaf3384bad3e71d77daafe2bfd131708673d; d6c129dc74dec60791d33c9a20c64533c4825f9b; dd7bfa6efeb4d8a85971af7dc31e8ace434729c8; 2c61b3444ca9f9064042659e12f9051a763dba3b; 7419376551c20fc88f524cb08e32aff7d348b90f; 05638e4097c4c1fbe07d4e751868f57c4f5f3c87; a1603b17fc5d5a130964fb81661ed1dca375c43f; ba8c057a76e6259b7e0de17a135c428ebea2b4b7; d401626b8887e7a12961fd2c44101366d7128402,aed0a148d5c6775f6b906b9b8a5d58dd6dac99d7; 392b31ea1f78df3ffdb5f64be340050e8abec038; 2c65e74142ac0fe999212ec1d60346520a6a9190; 874916fcd78d96fc503eac1752d487367a2f1d13; bf78a18dd547155c83eda81de3fb75321ef143e5; ffc75abdce35dfe29da474181ee5e74cd025a235; ab4b156d0d6d598cfb366d5fd0e1091f48d0376d; 8205ce1955e31182292c506cd58cc628e08fb33c; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; abaa0658ca9177590f45afe114120e33849f0088; b39a904c2edcb1f4da776c94d044e7d108c08775; e7f9254f8e9678dedd8c2ccee99624c271ceeb14; 4b846edcc41d6347f789df20ae08ca09c0504b1e; 5aeb1aeb9ca95b17755f9f75d2715a56864288f5; 03305422d77833627b065b5d234ebad23c71c2b5; 003c3340e02f455be622b20d75091d60e759528c; 3249683f54fd2ac716d4fa35593067811123b85b; fc330d7be571bdbfc495e82ed3f5fbd6bca6ce4f; 2566e19b5899eb9b035dc6f08b00adb2bdf8b503; b61ecd5940c16d6fdfb505d3cac0c64edaee8311; 1b3d026ea39ba56556ccbd0ba575a4a57dd71588; 0ee8b2999019216bc860ea5f6a51a56cedca17ea; f3a7f555b30754f768c38139b01546de66736e98; 3ba242a0a36158bfafb989d5685b3c8f00096b03; bf3a8dfa1157ec1608eec9a6d2e73dc5971153f9; 2c8ec6b1e8eb342786028dbf9babe5f61094ff20; 8dd8ec64adaaad84f4040c44e7eea7a38f62c8d5; 3286e725eb40805415886d0cc4494652e17b84f2; e3841b601bef933ce64aee7cf9988fed823136fc,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,88 4,"

In this study, we aimed to investigate the influence of PNPLA3 polymorphisms on liver fat content (LFC) and glucose metabolic variables, and the associations between these, during the natural course of body weight changes in a Chinese adult cohort.MethodsThe LFC, measured using a quantitative ultrasound method, was prospectively monitored in 2189 middle-aged and elderly adults from the Shanghai Changfeng Study, together with changes in body weight and metabolic variables. General linear models were used to detect interactive effects between the PNPLA3 rs738409 genotype and 4Â year changes in body weight on liver steatosis and glucose metabolism.ResultsThe PNPLA3 homozygous GG genotype dissociated the changes in the LFC and OGTT 2Â h post-load blood glucose (PBG) in relation to 4Â year changes in body weight. PNPLA3 GG genotype carriers showed greater increases in the LFC and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) but lower PBG elevation and incident diabetes than PNPLA3 wild-type (CC) genotype carriers exhibiting the same degree of body weight increase. The interactions between the PNPLA3 genotype and changes in body weight on the LFC (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted pinteractionâ€‰=â€‰0.044) and ALT (FDR-adjusted pinteractionâ€‰=â€‰0.044) were significant. Subgroup analyses showed that the effect of the PNPLA3 GG genotype on changes in the LFC and PBG was only observed in metabolically unhealthy participants with insulin resistance or abdominal obesity.Conclusions/interpretationThe PNPLA3 GG genotype interacted with changes in body weight to aggravate liver steatosis but reduced the risk of incident type 2 diabetes in metabolically unhealthy participants.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ming-Feng Xia"", ids = ""34682323""); list(name = ""Huan-dong Lin"", ids = ""46933104""); list(name = ""Ling-yan Chen"", ids = ""47818676""); list(name = ""Li Xin Wu"", ids = ""98921124""); list(name = ""Hui Ma"", ids = ""144258292""); list(name = ""Qian Li"", ids = ""150270375""); list(name = ""Qiqige Aleteng"", ids = ""3920246""); list(name = ""Yu Sheng Hu"", ids = ""21650061""); list(name = ""Wan-Yuan He"", ids = ""7845422""); list(name = ""Jian Gao"", ids = ""144029128""); list(name = ""Hua Bian"", ids = ""39585975""); list(name = ""Xiao-ying Li"", ids = ""47056953""); list(name = ""Xin Gao"", ids = ""143703146"")",22cef13f08ca385b5e3a0d76bec675302655723c,f627803f7c98ecbf96867986ff3fe7e3b13663b2; 19e31328370f03176f369e031f50f7f269249316; e86483bc9836445e26a30bdc91ac6f182057e28f; 6e46990af0bff0a7fe3e151a40ce29aab13a7069; 4e1d13083ec59bbe67526479685d64adbd71bd65; 9749cc4ae398e77b6989225cb63b0a2ed5251906; 9f5236ad1772d90799c398f7c8a483c83b62df75; 6371c90ff5eea4675d09d6820fd41527f962e6dd; 842f02ace57d72b70f7318526ff3cc7508938524; 8e30310e03722e4ca69e5f4269a00b19a80fc1bd; ab80f530c6816fb22ffa212a7549ce05494dae14; af042dd34fe139aa27a64502219a578d56ed09a8; eb2d2cd53c50dbbe5e17314b15656799203a9108; 34f519210d89af1ae71479d8821ad3defbed30c8; b6ba5d7873a638d673998b2b1dff441e105c1db2; 5c6349157d7ba73a999e8284ac5d79da74d9e36c; fa5d9cf26068728673db6d649099dda426aa7834; 74c0bd79b357df86518e63a2df8763c7181f57a1; c7e92aa29d2e17dba280b58ca0b241ff3847a1cc; 267015b987e466169b0f962d3eabc518f685cc18; c5f8770b6cd474597cb623fc164bb021063e0f89; a45874cb3d279f7c7c4d6c6fc865d5507a34569f; cb3d967016ffb8f4a860f79fb4fb984e167e8831; 5ce37354bd6a212cf2b6aa8831fbbc8e353dfab9; 4317bfd4cb1562ea16571aa48542b8a7a98f1698; 7277cd189432336f10df5662972a45b538f388a5; 4b9a4004623cdbb131b717c8cbede8592cba01bd; a883e61c8bcaca690ac2a7e07f8d4c78882e5fb3; c16f15fafe03256c181773e6e5c417c6abd1d019; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c51546e89afe7de880b91af9c889308b18ceee87; 2e3f127a1448ad1e86c20b0a441eb74e3ad5bfcf; 292dbe8bf19ba0150d3ae3c793dcad2b3275c65b; 21639d8139336d6313ed0b6396cdb49c396ed086; ef222a353ea022f6eb2af333a3c410913d452004; 6cc037845f96735e5ad5850ede792b799ca53bc8; d47a783d77daafeb1e1daf14ae6de1dc3bfa522f; 6331680732248965ceeb0c2323ab4fe0e2cd806d; 690cc1b52e855405ee891be1eab774a86db2ec0f; 0e56035b0d4cdac79e138d0554010ddf9f19b119; 0d37499ed6641d8ac5ec39c71f971c9b92a21a16,Diabetologia,62,644-654

To determine whether copy number variations (CNVs) in FCGR3A and FCGR3B are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Taiwanese individuals.


METHODS
FCGR3A and FCGR3B CNV genotypes were determined in 846 patients with SLE, 948 patients with RA, and 1,420 healthy control subjects, using custom TaqMan CNV assays. The FCGR3A and FCGR3B CNV genotypes were compared between healthy control subjects and patients and among patients stratified according to clinical characteristics.


RESULTS
A low (<2) FCGR3A copy number was significantly associated with SLE (for <2 copies versus 2 copies, P = 5.06 Ã— 10(-4) , false discovery rate-corrected P [PFDR ] = 0.001, odds ratio [OR] 3.26, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.68-6.35) and RA (for <2 copies versus 2 copies, P = 5.83 Ã— 10(-4) , PFDR = 0.0012, OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.56-5.1). A low FCGR3B copy number was also significantly associated with SLE (for <2 copies versus 2 copies, P = 0.0032, PFDR = 0.0032, OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.17-2.18). Notably, a high (>2) FCGR3A copy number was also associated with SLE (for >2 copies versus 2 copies, P = 0.003, PFDR = 0.0061, OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.17-2.18). Additionally, the FCGR3A low copy number genotype was significantly enriched in subsets of patients with SLE (those with ulcer, arthritis, rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, nephritis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, depressed complement levels, and autoantibody positivity) and patients with RA (those positive for rheumatoid factor) compared with healthy control subjects. The FCGR3B low copy number genotype was also significantly enriched in SLE patients with ulcer, rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, ascites, nephritis, complement level depression, and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody positivity compared with control subjects. However, FCGR3B CNVs were not associated with RA susceptibility (for <2 copy numbers versus 2 copy numbers, P = 0.3584, OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.85-1.55) and clinical characteristics.


CONCLUSION
In Taiwanese individuals, a low FCGR3A copy number is a common risk factor for SLE and RA, while a low FCGR3B copy number confers a risk of SLE but not RA.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ji-Yih Chen"", ids = ""144535008""); list(name = ""Chin-Man Wang"", ids = ""3673814""); list(name = ""Su-Wei Chang"", ids = ""2687846""); list(name = ""Ching-Hui Cheng"", ids = ""10771250""); list(name = ""Y.

This is mainly because the number of covariates exceeds the sample size. In this paper, we propose a simple and novel alternative by introducing the Correlated Predictors Screening (CPS) method to control for predictors that are highly correlated with the target covariate. Accordingly, the classical ordinary least squares approach can be employed to estimate the regression coefficient associated with the target covariate. In addition, we demonstrate that the resulting estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal even if the random errors are heteroscedastic. This enables us to apply the z-test to assess the significance of each covariate. Based on the p-value obtained from testing the significance of each covariate, we further conduct multiple hypothesis testing by controlling the false discovery rate at the nominal level. Then, we show that the multiple hypothesis testing achieves consistent model selection. Simulation studies and empirical examples are presented to illustrate the finite sample performance and the usefulness of the proposed method, respectively.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""W. X.

c9f23a4f0c0beb5a2246c38eb4eb8f5df00e061c,Inflammatory gene polymorphisms and risk of postoperative myocardial infarction after cardiac surgery.,"BACKGROUND
The inflammatory response triggered by cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a primary mechanism in the pathogenesis of postoperative myocardial infarction (PMI), a multifactorial disorder with significant inter-patient variability poorly predicted by clinical and procedural factors. We tested the hypothesis that candidate gene polymorphisms in inflammatory pathways contribute to risk of PMI after cardiac surgery.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We genotyped 48 polymorphisms from 23 candidate genes in a prospective cohort of 434 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with CPB. PMI was defined as creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme level > or = 10x upper limit of normal at 24 hours postoperatively. A 2-step analysis strategy was used: marker selection, followed by model building. To minimize false-positive associations, we adjusted for multiple testing by permutation analysis, Bonferroni correction, and controlling the false discovery rate; 52 patients (12%) experienced PMI. After adjusting for multiple comparisons and clinical risk factors, 3 polymorphisms were found to be independent predictors of PMI (adjusted P<0.05; false discovery rate <10%). These gene variants encode the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL6 -572G>C; odds ratio [OR], 2.47), and 2 adhesion molecules: intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1 Lys469Glu; OR, 1.88), and E-selectin (SELE 98G>T; OR, 0.16). The inclusion of genotypic information from these polymorphisms improved prediction models for PMI based on traditional risk factors alone (C-statistic 0.764 versus 0.703).


CONCLUSIONS
Functional genetic variants in cytokine and leukocyte-endothelial interaction pathways are independently associated with severity of myonecrosis after cardiac surgery. This may aid in preoperative identification of high-risk cardiac surgical patients and development of novel cardioprotective strategies.",2006,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mihai V Podgoreanu"", ids = ""5757598""); list(name = ""William D.

23b18d769284a6ddf8bd88d22adda4e79d7600f6,Local false discovery rate facilitates comparison of different microarray experiments,"The local false discovery rate (LFDR) estimates the probability of falsely identifying specific genes with changes in expression. In computer simulations, LFDR <10% successfully identified genes with changes in expression, while LFDR >90% identified genes without changes. We used LFDR to compare different microarray experiments quantitatively: (i) Venn diagrams of genes with and without changes in expression, (ii) scatter plots of the genes, (iii) correlation coefficients in the scatter plots and (iv) distributions of gene function. To illustrate, we compared three methods for pre-processing microarray data. Correlations between methods were high (r = 0.84-0.92). However, responses were often different in magnitude, and sometimes discordant, even though the methods used the same raw data. LFDR complements functional assessments like gene set enrichment analysis. To illustrate, we compared responses to ultraviolet radiation (UV), ionizing radiation (IR) and tobacco smoke. Compared to unresponsive genes, genes responsive to both UV and IR were enriched for cell cycle, mitosis, and DNA repair functions. Genes responsive to UV but not IR were depleted for cell adhesion functions. Genes responsive to tobacco smoke were enriched for detoxification functions. Thus, LFDR reveals differences and similarities among experiments.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Wan-Jen Hong"", ids = ""123070649""); list(name = ""Robert Tibshirani"", ids = ""1761784""); list(name = ""Gilbert Chu"", ids = ""144746375"")",76867d46bc8c3664b928827cefe9d4f2b192356f; 60e59044054c7d7eb521ee89534e36d5e5370dd8; 2f778c0c938a1a3fa4d0118794695f729a4764fe; a2a64a5122f616f570531cd183881ce2f00d3ddb; db54f4d6a1ebee6672b5075317f9124779d928df; 4bd46647b4dd58e8ea0878f6074b89ef63eba2d0; 46a616d47b91cb28eecf497e6c33e85c315afe5c; 865f2125893ed9219df579574890049c9b3ad6d1; 6faf817a200537fa24127da2d2d4741df99d6219; 7a3754cf4d15203e3b10e1dadb1ccd11bddbf109; 6c6b48ad915a47b0052673061dddf364380c7f86,f0bdeb00f73bb4528fa049bafca30edce2f2383c; 422adc24881a92ba1d934dc7bc1b686764e6336e; 2def5ea8b905c5742e989279f14bab82e560a07e; 82607a99435e45adfcae9972da976801e0ee41ae; 514ed7b51fefd6cbbd087d50b7bc86f98c7e528e; c86900fc9f326e9861adc395c7e4be93dcdb8c2c; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e625116f9671b49af6ea27da049c123b134f22ae; a135e5b92e321d8b1367ccfa53f998ab8021226d; a6fbeee300d7f684a8b83c2f86d650501cb7de5d; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 1a0efda6a3e104a4cafb4e64805e53c754a403dc; 186575de7fcb95d3e149a7e535232ec12cf9b108; 8573bbb55112c1f06c43211daedacc1578e69a92; 061e3f68492a2437ac6675147b9cae22fa73f2c0; 83e6025f99ad97864db7a3b616778dbfef396ce8; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; fd4b45dcbdca97567ef0b0a085824a5044d884d4; 265e956244f706574578e23a9d7dc3c24cba146b; edf8ec8a72afa7fbd2d583768bba1d08873eef1b; 8e0effa37bdf8d04ac21a5aff842bf31b982bac1; a877ee679e9edf0d1f5950b7249d368195ce3170; 6204d731bf1d1b664035c99621922cb7269a4eda,Nucleic Acids Research,37,7483 - 7497
7431dc012ba2ead3e209595f328a02304c78dd73,A Multi-tissue Transcriptome Analysis of Human Metabolites Guides Interpretability of Associations Based on Multi-SNP Models for Gene Expression,"There is particular interest in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) gene-level tests based on multi-SNP predictive models of gene expression-for identifying causal genes at loci associated with complex traits. However, interpretation of TWAS associations may be complicated by divergent effects of model SNPs on phenotype and gene expression. We developed an iterative modeling scheme for obtaining multi-SNP models of gene expression and applied this framework to generate expression models for 43 human tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. We characterized the performance of single- and multi-SNP models for identifying causal genes in GWAS data for 46 circulating metabolites. We show that: (A) multi-SNP models captured more variation in expression than did the top cis-eQTL (median 2-fold improvement); (B) predicted expression based on multi-SNP models was associated (false discovery rate < 0.01) with metabolite levels for 826 unique gene-metabolite pairs, but, after stepwise conditional analyses, 90% were dominated by a single eQTL SNP; (C) among the 35% of associations where a SNP in the expression model was a significant cis-eQTL and metabolomic-QTL (met-QTL), 92% demonstrated colocalization between these signals, but interpretation was often complicated by incomplete overlap of QTLs in multi-SNP models; and (D) using a ""truth"" set of causal genes at 61 met-QTLs, the sensitivity was high (67%), but the positive predictive value was low, as only 8% of TWAS associations (19% when restricted to colocalized associations at met-QTLs) involved true causal genes. These results guide the interpretation of TWAS and highlight the need for corroborative data to provide confident assignment of causality.",2020,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Anne W.

af9c5775eb24ec6c6c1402e5442d95219f6eaf67,Streaming feature selection using alpha-investing,"In Streaming Feature Selection (SFS), new features are sequentially considered for addition to a predictive model. When the space of potential features is large, SFS offers many advantages over traditional feature selection methods, which assume that all features are known in advance. Features can be generated dynamically, focusing the search for new features on promising subspaces, and overfitting can be controlled by dynamically adjusting the threshold for adding features to the model. We describe Î±-investing, an adaptive complexity penalty method for SFS which dynamically adjusts the threshold on the error reduction required for adding a new feature. Î±-investing gives false discovery rate-style guarantees against overfitting. It differs from standard penalty methods such as AIC, BIC or RIC, which always drastically over- or under-fit in the limit of infinite numbers of non-predictive features.

9d06f0cf95ea84bfd9ed875f452e85ce9e003e71,Getting more from digital SNP data.,"The digital SNP method has been proposed for identifying loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumour tissue and correlating it with patients' clinical characteristics. The method evaluates a tumour's allelic count at a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for which the patient's normal tissue is heterozygous. The count is used to classify the tumour as positive or negative for LOH, using the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). However, the SPRT was not developed for analysing digital SNP experiments. When applied to digital SNP data, the SPRT has several anomalies that can result in both loss of data and tumour misclassification. The anomalies are caused by discrepancies between the design of digital SNP experiments and the setting for which SPRT was developed. We propose an alternative classification scheme based on the false discovery rate, and show that it outperforms the SPRT when applied to Digital SNP data.",2006,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Noureddine El Karoui"", ids = ""47126462""); list(name = ""Wei Zhou"", ids = ""46352218""); list(name = ""Alice S.

Background: Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely implicated in a variety of cancers and have been recognized as prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers. Lack of a standard method for stratifying advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving platinum combination therapy often results in a number of patients that do not derive benefit yet are still exposed to treatment toxicity. We hypothesized that miRNAs in pre-treatment serum and/or plasma could be used to differentiate NSCLC patients who would have disease progression (PD) to first-line carboplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy at first response assessment.

Methods: miRNA array profiling containing probes in triplicate for 900 mature miRNAs (Sanger miRBASE v13.0 released in March 2009) and 450 precursor (pre-) miRNAs along with positive and negative control probes was performed on total RNA isolated from the pre-treatment serum and plasma of 24 advanced or unresectable NSCLC patients who went on to receive first-line carboplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. SAM data analysis was applied to find significantly differentially-expressed miRNAs in one condition (PD at first radiologic response) in contrast to another (those without disease progression [nonPD]). Data was normalized to U6 small nuclear RNA and the top differentially-expressed miRNAs were identified based on fold change, p-values, q-values, and false discovery rates. Differentially-expressed miRNAs were validated by quantitative PCR. Single validated candidates or combinations thereof were selected based on specificity and sensitivity to segregate patients with PD vs. nonPD. Correlations for clinical parameters with candidate miRNA were also assessed.

Results: Four miRNAs were identified using miRNA microarray as potential candidate qualifiers. Two of them, pre-miR-518b and pre-miR-598, were validated in a qPCR assay and were shown to be significantly over-expressed in serum of PD patients. ROC curves plotting a combination of these two pre-miRNAs were able to discriminate between PD vs. nonPD patients with 83% sensitivity and 72% specificity. No significant correlation of these two pre-miRNAs was observed with clinical parameters such as age, gender, histology, smoking status, or overall survival. No significant plasma miRNA candidates were identified.

Conclusion: Serum miRNAs may serve as a proof-of-concept screening tool in predicting chemoresistance to platinum-based combination chemotherapy. This is an important step towards personalized medicine and could enable stratification of patients to treatment options thus reducing exposure to specific toxic chemotherapy agents that in the end result would not benefit the patient.

846e3250a5efbe49abd19981ea625df6fab35b5d,Bioinformatics Analysis in Differences of RNA Expression in the Tendon According to Anatomic Outcomes in Rotator Cuff Repair: Response,"Dear Editor: We read with great interest the recent report by Ahn et al, â€˜â€˜Differences of RNA Expression in the Tendon According to Anatomic Outcomes in Rotator Cuff Repair,â€™â€™ which appeared in the June 2017 issue of The American Journal of Sports Medicine. The results of the report are very helpful for us; however, from our perspective, the authorsâ€™ methods in bioinformatics analysis are inappropriate. We noticed that the authors used Student t tests for detecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healed and unhealed groups. Actually, due to the high false-positive rate caused by a huge number of probes and multiple comparisons, it is fundamental to analyze microarray data properly to reach a reliable result by a rational statistical method, but the Student t test is not affected by heterogeneity in variance across genes because it considers information from only 1 gene. Obviously, the Student t test is not stable or suitable for high-level microarray analysis. But, if the Student t test is used for DEG analysis in the microarray, setting an adjusted P \ .05 with multiple testing corrections according to the Benjamini-Hochberg method as the cutoff is a reasonable method. In addition, we recommend using specialized high-level microarray analysis, limma (Linear Models for Microarray Analysis), a commonly used statistical test to analyze differential expression package by using linear models. Further, choosing more than 1.5-fold expression changes and false discovery rate (FDR) \0.05 as the cutoff is an appropriate and conservative approach to obtain DEGs. Moreover, Significant Analysis of Microarray (SAM) is also a nonparametric statistical algorithm to consider, and 2-fold expression change and q \ 0.1 are rational cutoffs to obtain DEGs. Above all, although the authors performed extra analysis for a portion of DEGs in order to verify the results of the microarray, it is impractical when using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other technology to verify all DEGs. Choosing the proper statistical method and obtaining more accurate and convincing results of DEG analysis form the basis for further analyses such as gene ontology enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis.

a3b3bae7127b1dbb915094007fa79065f8dfe592,A novel transcriptional network for the androgen receptor in human epididymis epithelial cells,"STUDY QUESTION
What is the transcriptional network governed by the androgen receptor (AR) in human epididymis epithelial (HEE) cells from the caput region and if the network is tissue-specific, how is this achieved?


SUMMARY ANSWER
About 200 genes are differentially expressed in the caput HEE cells after AR activation; the AR transcriptional network is tissue-specific and may be mediated in part by distinct AR co-factors including CAAT-enhancer binding protein beta (CEBPB) and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1).


WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY
Little is known about the AR transcriptional program genome wide in HEE cells, nor its co-factors in those cells. AR has been best studied in the prostate gland epithelium and prostate cancer cell lines, due to the important role of this factor in prostate cancer. However AR-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and AR co-factors have not yet been compared between human epididymis and prostate epithelial cells.


STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION
Caput HEE cells from two donors were exposed to the synthetic androgen R1881 at 1 nM for 12-16 h after 72 h of hormone starvation.


PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS
Chromatin was prepared from R1881-treated and vehicle control HEE cells. AR-associated chromatin was purified by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and AR occupancy genome wide was revealed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). Two independent biological replicates were performed. Total RNA was prepared from R1881 and control-treated HEE cells and gene expression profiles were documented by RNA-seq. The interaction of the potential novel AR co-factors CEBPB and RUNX1, identified through in-silico motif analysis of AR ChIP-seq data, was examined by ChIP-qPCR after siRNA-mediated depletion of each co-factor individually or simultaneously.


MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE
The results identify about 200 genes that are differentially expressed (DEGs) in HEE cells after AR activation. Some of these DEGs show occupancy of AR at their promoters or cis-regulatory elements suggesting direct regulation. However, there is little overlap in AR-associated DEGs between HEE and prostate epithelial cells. Inspection of over-represented motifs in AR ChIP-seq peaks identified CEBPB and RUNX1 as potential co-factors, with no evidence for FOXA1, which is an important co-factor in the prostate epithelium. CEBPB and RUNX1 ChIP-seq in HEE cells showed that both these factors often occupied AR-binding sites, though rarely simultaneously. Further analysis at a single AR-regulated locus (FK506-binding protein 5, FKPB5) suggests that CEBPB may be a co-activator. These data suggest a novel AR transcriptional network governs differentiated functions of the human epididymis epithelium.


LARGE SCALE DATA
AR ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data are deposited at GEO: GSE109063.


LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION
There is substantial donor-to-donor variation in primary HEE cells cultures. We applied stringent statistical tests with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1% for ChIP-seq and standard pipelines for RNA-seq so it is possible that we have missed some AR-regulated genes that are important in caput epididymis function.


WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS
Our data suggest that a novel AR transcriptional network governs differentiated functions of the human epididymis epithelium. Since this cell layer has a critical role in normal sperm maturation, the results are of broader significance in understanding the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of fertility in men.

43d1dfefab6c85e9fa5f83b15bb28efff95079b7,RNA-sequencing analysis of aberrantly expressed long non-coding RNAs and mRNAs in a mouse model of ventilator-induced lung injury,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are closely associated with the regulation of various biological processes and are involved in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. However, to the best of our knowledge, the role of lncRNAs in ventilatorâ€‘induced lung injury (VILI) has yet to be evaluated. In the present study, highâ€‘throughput sequencing was applied to investigate differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs (fold change >2; false discovery rate <0.05). Bioinformatics analysis was employed to predict the functions of differentially expressed lncRNAs. A total of 104Â lncRNAs (74Â upregulated and 30Â downregulated) and 809Â mRNAs (521Â upregulated and 288Â downregulated) were differentially expressed in lung tissues from the VILI group. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were mainly associated with biological functions, including apoptosis, angiogenesis, neutrophil chemotaxis and skeletal muscle cell differentiation. The top four enriched pathways were the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, P53 signaling pathway, neuroactive ligandâ€‘receptor interaction and the forkhead box O signaling pathway. Several lncRNAs were predicted to serve a vital role in VILI. Subsequently, three lncRNAs [mitogenâ€‘activated protein kinase kinase 3, opposite strand (Map2k3os), dynaminÂ 3, opposite strand and abhydrolase domain containingÂ 11, opposite strand] and three mRNAs (growth arrest and DNA damageâ€‘inducible Î±, claudinÂ 4 and thromboxane A2 receptor) were measured by reverse transcriptionâ€‘quantitative polymerase chain reaction, in order to confirm the veracity of RNAâ€‘sequencing analysis. In addition, Map2k3os small interfering RNA transfection inhibited the expression of stretchâ€‘induced cytokines [TNFâ€‘Î±, interleukin (IL)â€‘1Î² and ILâ€‘6] in MLE12 cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study provided a profile of differentially expressed lncRNAs in VILI. Several important lncRNAs may be involved in the pathological process of VILI, which may be useful to guide further investigation into the pathogenesis for this disease.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Bo Xu"", ids = ""143778543""); list(name = ""Yizhou Wang"", ids = ""40349060""); list(name = ""Xiujuan Li"", ids = ""2548240""); list(name = ""Yanfei Mao"", ids = ""2059016""); list(name = ""Xiaoming Deng"", ids = ""144042641"")",,54a5c3b735be51ea7649e0ff8ab30746ffe2d256; bd5cc93abb7f4e7cc2a2a1c9ab0ef68a48b9b1c7; e024ee20365a4bb64ec5fed3d4678c5b0da7a701; c1b9640fa69649ca3884600a7c246d94d40a335f; 3027b2a41caac33816144afb23fa6a55040edc4d; 49b99731867bae43a56757c5dfef0d49c9f4d402; 9c8dccab86e2f0d658bb8ec7e55ffd512d6403eb; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; 42e766498a7c8d318e5840ccc66359fac71d3537; d6e08708bef41b6effd1fe662fd68dc2a0514f86; 954a8c9c847694a53e754d3ffe5a3f290c43ac17; 68eb66c16cc20d2d37fcb90ca422f6bf704a0354; 847a6c7f4882e524e3b02fb0400823909c3d9f4e; f58cf530a9d2ef5332db41cfb8a98b3cab509bf7; bb1223a03c8419afdea1c081ac5a4f5672e79f79; 7f8faac956246753d8e34c632d0eb23164bc39d7; 01a5cc5330dc2d2853f62a562f67f27b20e61f05; 1312aea57f3db7a1940fffe47af05f34e5b26fe4; 712a1d3fb73b0ab062813df5b4b6243b777c820f; 4667ad4302254f67ef8c831ede8e4cd8d0709715; fcf822a281ee6734fc56139674fe9a5820298214; c6b27b60f1cdc28411fd2e925bd80a106e064964; 5700bce5d4fc9685466027b1cbfe50120996fbf0; 22bf43d7cfbfa0a3a4fc2e9711a5e6f8b6f72b56; f26fa2e77a928fa7d3ce1185685103ed462c4828; 12de52d9061626d8f163666f7da428b9cb7c94c2; 2807e02c0d1b4009f1dfdc4900f434d4936c4563; aee8cb49295123081b158f81d3b5adc8b8d66c20; 5d7fdc603c07c1233d0c52af1e9e8efc9a38c182; 87ccc438b0c73fcfdea48485fcdb091a8ecaa89c; 6daee6986a03a3b86190edf7fb620557dbb026a4; 827dc655b74de9cdecca9900f6e0dbac8cb9b265; ea9ba2c8b688abd452a745b54890c22b5c795d7c; 46c9cf09aad712f4e064a5316f5e112b28e8a5dc; 6a7dc37054f997823eaf67c3655899bd947e8d88; f81f475919bde402ce0212a0cef724eca502100c; f82566e2fded49f0d7fd4fa84bb023d3d5b699c0; ba9987a3172e496c1a441a8807f08c9c4104928c; d4bdc379f30c312116f5a7bcc0576d4dd883b255; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; 905205f5d694f9fdbb096252c3f9e573c9703c4e; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 4f2ee6696a2f3579c62772d1c450b79c5854498c; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a33bbacc55b69adf894bbb1b423b9b4c5b031ae0; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; 96b4182087f67b245f406e7e44f955fe999ff9bb; a7dc78dc9a5afbbb25263752579bc5cc7e625f47; 6f26798ec2d5b44ff343f7f6781f76cf626f2dd2; 1e9b11e9b440c02ad8ea5d6bd5ee4a717fece2c3; 0fcce286a483b75a4dfb41336b265989b6603f35; eed9e9bb926c3aa3332026ea00615c75bfdc4e22; 3495814c2bda2849c72db2afc20229a17a25041c; 65a7c5603370ae6b46fc9fea6e6a291e679bec9a,Molecular Medicine Reports,18,882 - 892
31827245cdaeb8b78012f8c104cf9e96853eaf82,Combining singular value decomposition and t-test into hybrid approach for significant gene extraction from microarray data,"Significant gene extraction from microarray data is a challenging problem which is of great interest to researchers in Computational Biology, Medicine, Computer Science and Statistics. A number of methods have been proposed for extracting the smallest number of genes which can accurately classify different samples. Most of these methods ignore the fact that microarray data is mostly noisy. For instance, only using a statistical t-test has been shown to be insufficient since it result in a high false discovery rate. Recently, a singular value decomposition (SVD) based approach was proposed for time series microarray data reduction, however it turned out not to be efficient for classifying microarray data. To overcome the shortcomings of these approaches, this paper proposes two methods to reduce false discovery rates. The first method involves an iterative t-test which finds the p-value for each gene under perturbation by eliminating one sample at a time. It eliminates weak noisy genes by dropping any gene which does not show significant p-value under all the conditions. The second method is a hybrid process which adapts a combination of the SVD and the t-test. It considers the entropy of all the data, and thus takes the correlation between genes into account. Classification accuracy is used to validate the significance of the extracted genes. The reported test results on two datasets demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the two proposed methods.",2008,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Mohammed Al-Shalalfa"", ids = ""48100607""); list(name = ""Reda Alhajj"", ids = ""144451974""); list(name = ""Jon G.

59d68e3011bc8236b8831bc780742f8135bd2ac7,Building phenotype networks to improve QTL detection: a comparative analysis of fatty acid and fat traits in pigs.,"Models in QTL mapping can be improved by considering all potential variables, i.e. we can use remaining traits other than the trait under study as potential predictors. QTL mapping is often conducted by correcting for a few fixed effects or covariates (e.g. sex, age), although many traits with potential causal relationships between them are recorded. In this work, we evaluate by simulation several procedures to identify optimum models in QTL scans: forward selection, undirected dependency graph and QTL-directed dependency graph (QDG). The latter, QDG, performed better in terms of power and false discovery rate and was applied to fatty acid (FA) composition and fat deposition traits in two pig F2 crosses from China and Spain. Compared with the typical QTL mapping, QDG approach revealed several new QTL. To the contrary, several FA QTL on chromosome 4 (e.g. Palmitic, C16:0; Stearic, C18:0) detected by typical mapping vanished after adjusting for phenotypic covariates in QDG mapping. This suggests that the QTL detected in typical mapping could be indirect. When a QTL is supported by both approaches, there is an increased confidence that the QTL have a primary effect on the corresponding trait. An example is a QTL for C16:1 on chromosome 8. In conclusion, mapping QTL based on causal phenotypic networks can increase power and help to make more biologically sound hypothesis on the genetic architecture of complex traits.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Baiyu Yang"", ids = ""144348488""); list(name = ""Nicolas Navarro"", ids = ""49210766""); list(name = ""Jose Luis Vazquez Noguera"", ids = ""1829876""); list(name = ""M MuÃ±oz"", ids = ""144055334""); list(name = ""Tiankui Guo"", ids = ""48902045""); list(name = ""Karl X.

9a17919aed460f59dbcf4d280fd601598995f35e,Molecular QTL discovery incorporating genomic annotations using Bayesian false discovery rate control,"Mapping molecular QTLs has emerged as an important tool for understanding the genetic basis of cell functions. With the increasing availability of functional genomic data, it is natural to incorporate genomic annotations into QTL discovery. Discovering molecular QTLs is typically framed as a multiple hypothesis testing problem and solved using false discovery rate (FDR) control procedures. Currently, most existing statistical approaches rely on obtaining p-values for each candidate locus through permutation-based schemes, which are not only inconvenient for incorporating highly informative genomic annotations but also computationally inefficient. In this paper, we discuss a novel statistical approach for integrative QTL discovery based on the theoretical framework of Bayesian FDR control. We use a Bayesian hierarchical model to naturally integrate genomic annotations into molecular QTL mapping and propose an empirical Bayesbased computational procedure to approximate the necessary posterior probabilities to achieve high computational efficiency. Through theoretical arguments and simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed approach rigorously controls the desired type I error rate and greatly improves the power of QTL discovery when incorporating informative annotations. Finally, we demonstrate our approach by analyzing the expression-genotype data from 44 human tissues generated by the GTEx project. By integrating the simple annotation of SNP distance to transcription start sites, we discover more genes that harbor expression-associated SNPs in all 44 tissues, with an average increase of 1,485 genes per tissue.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Xiaoquan Wen"", ids = ""36836750"")",e0d41352b17d45047b69ec0169e2a1ef29610bd7; 65127b33f7e256db0c9c7b7d3912a85d8f2fd574; ac7bc0b69e6ce836846a8c5c1f56a09f01ce13cb; 08939fc026c1efcddeca0e9af4de53e116478deb; a3ebcf57746762779fb95dceba5f8d2c9f01b998; 55b8eceee4287a247cd271c8b32be61564e40889; 3a2f88d78d6b7b5f8afa16b4dc1f150a621cf0e0; 8f08392a2e978ade1dfdf7722af32dc73a1afc20; 07f380355f4194a128c0e356ba59890a92a6c87d; 7eed0f7f7b128413fdb78ad803c41e65e619715e; 8badd05203f30bfa58360a4e599dddfef25c9b2f; f723f7b1c17ce0d6b82c8a467377e708a6e0015c,d1f2d78bf551b97e4c6e0a522d40ce837265c683; b5f109c8d49a95f72313aff41cf8a0b2e8e1407a; 4d71d6d4d6d485f68d523d6a45ab2ae742ba5e57; fd0df3b6c311fa8494e459c6d2e370f030f34259; 8cddedb17eeb70171a8d58c4eb0582e84e347066; 3d6751b1be76dbdd0a3e65eb45e973bb8d2c4376; afbb4916bd1de07f6c1baa614b1d3c57451cadfd; 9d24d45821ff8940739850ce962e36c876e0341d; e85e68862dd0eed5ebe900c2721a2dfb1c237c9f; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; 310e6a925850a80ccc5c29f813c71f666a14fa39; 0a41e54688c618973c897c1a9cb22a02b5d3ced5; 73dde1c522dcfbc5064d3156bd3358bd6d2cce4e; 248b702476d53e59c50c3cc55193ee15b750058e; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; a771dee848037eaf2236c68cddf6c7d2993bb424; fd3e0a65096ebb7ae301cd9e3ccc6ac7fee1111e; 5b4589e473cdbdb24d8a8979f51b6e984d717232; 03be636697c84eb22114f09de6c1bea215cc87c8; d880d72c59f61ea49b9ab71f0c23a1cdd1705071; c41783252096992982999e543b86e6d7c8af9c6d; e3d531fcf4ef7815e41958293ee7734428610a0a; ca63333d4a67823f8cadec7127358e3b5f13bb9d; e46cdca3503b26d949191e86b24cc464fc885482; 328ffc2e64c790a9467503c3ba37cca3f9ab66a7; 230f57422b47cbeb95af7ce383a2aa414fa2b8e1; cd90714a9928827e81a18f0c1516813a78e9df94; dc791b8176fee4f218a960990c54946696d6f35d; 3cd7a55e53634e100dfb2ec25d64b4650d0a576d; 7d620489c1b5c157e62228906d11eaea959bc841; 7fd4f8e9167677ce2e062d36dd912df345427bd5; b088e0beee73075d4ebcc35469df4b67b70e51f5; f67da5d6d22493b779c5800b02c2fca64c50972b; eef9bafa8f5e772fedd1ae0937b8664f6ffcc102; 5da091c1d437a74fc4126f14047be4ea1dd0e9fe; 31eb8d8c0e6691f77bea7b340879b0fbab45fb30; afb644fc02a01534e0022b0218e779d1052e61da,The Annals of Applied Statistics,10,1619-1638
b118aac328dca9e0142465565787f3d601723a56,FDR made easy in differential feature discovery and correlation analyses,"SUMMARY
Rapid progress in technology, particularly in high-throughput biology, allows the analysis of thousands of genes or proteins simultaneously, where the multiple comparison problems occurs. Global false discovery rate (gFDR) analysis statistically controls this error, computing the ratio of the number of false positives over the total number of rejections. Local FDR (lFDR) method can associate the corrected significance measure with each hypothesis testing for its feature-by-feature interpretation. Given the large feature number and sample size in any genomics or proteomics analysis, FDR computation, albeit critical, is both beyond the regular biologists' specialty and computationally expensive, easily exceeding the capacity of desktop computers. To overcome this digital divide, a web portal has been developed that provides bench-side biologists easy access to the server-side computing capabilities to analyze for FDR, differential expressed genes or proteins, and for the correlation between molecular data and clinical measurements.

We sought to determine whether this manifests as aberrant regional changes in diffusivity or geometry of the left AF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed DTI studies in 16 young (age, 55.4 18.95 months) patients with DD and 11 age- and sex-matched TD children (age, 60.09 21.27 months). All children were right-handed. To detect the malformation of left AF structure in native or standard space, we proposed new methodology consisting of 2 complementary approaches, principal fiber orientation quantification in color-coded anisotropic maps and tract-based morphometry analysis. RESULTS: Patients with DD did not show the typical pattern of age-related maturity of the AP and ML pathways passing through the left AF (R 2 of the AP pathway: DD versus TD 0.002 versus 0.4542; R 2 of the ML pathway: DD versus TD 0.002 versus 0.4154). In addition, the patients with DD showed significantly reduced FA in the temporal portion of the AF (mean FA of DD versus TD 0.37 0.11 versus 0.48 0.06, P .001), and the AF showed higher curvatures in the parietotemporal junction, resulting in sharper bends to the Wernicke area (mean curvature of DD versus TD 0.12 0.03 versus 0.06 0.02, P .001). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed methods successfully revealed regional abnormalities in the axonal integrity of the left AF in the patients with DD. These abnormalities support the notion that the perisylvian language network is malformed in children with DD.

063f05da5c70d6b99c3658cdfae8a7e9550792c3,Urine metabolomic analysis identifies potential biomarkers and pathogenic pathways in kidney cancer.,"Kidney cancer is the seventh most common cancer in the Western world, its incidence is increasing, and it is frequently metastatic at presentation, at which stage patient survival statistics are grim. In addition, there are no useful biofluid markers for this disease, such that diagnosis is dependent on imaging techniques that are not generally used for screening. In the present study, we use metabolomics techniques to identify metabolites in kidney cancer patients' urine, which appear at different levels (when normalized to account for urine volume and concentration) from the same metabolites in nonkidney cancer patients. We found that quinolinate, 4-hydroxybenzoate, and gentisate are differentially expressed at a false discovery rate of 0.26, and these metabolites are involved in common pathways of specific amino acid and energetic metabolism, consistent with high tumor protein breakdown and utilization, and the Warburg effect. When added to four different (three kidney cancer-derived and one ""normal"") cell lines, several of the significantly altered metabolites, quinolinate, Î±-ketoglutarate, and gentisate, showed increased or unchanged cell proliferation that was cell line-dependent. Further evaluation of the global metabolomics analysis, as well as confirmation of the specific potential biomarkers using a larger sample size, will lead to new avenues of kidney cancer diagnosis and therapy.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kyoungmi Kim"", ids = ""145354043""); list(name = ""Sandra L.

5422a2a99870e82ba91ebfb26e8b6ed2227470bc,Testing over a continuum of null hypotheses,"We introduce a theoretical framework for performing statistical hypothesis testing simultaneously over a fairly general, possibly uncountably infinite, set of null hypotheses. This extends the standard statistical setting for multiple hypotheses testing, which is restricted to a finite set. This work is motivated by numerous modern applications where the observed signal is modeled by a stochastic process over a continuum. As a measure of type I error, we extend the concept of false discovery rate (FDR) to this setting. The FDR is defined as the average ratio of the measure of two random sets, so that its study presents some challenge and is of some intrinsic mathematical interest. Our main result shows how to use the $p$-value process to control the FDR at a nominal level, either under arbitrary dependence of $p$-values, or under the assumption that the finite dimensional distributions of the $p$-value process have positive correlations of a specific type (weak PRDS). Both cases generalize existing results established in the finite setting, the latter one leading to a less conservative procedure. The interest of this approach is demonstrated in several non-parametric examples: testing the mean/signal in a Gaussian white noise model, testing the intensity of a Poisson process and testing the c.d.f. of i.i.d. random variables. Conceptually, an interesting feature of the setting advocated here is that it focuses directly on the intrinsic hypothesis space associated with a testing model on a random process, without referring to an arbitrary discretization.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Gilles Blanchard"", ids = ""145945278""); list(name = ""Sylvain Delattre"", ids = ""2654204""); list(name = ""Etienne Roquain"", ids = ""3117456"")",451c2b09f99f7f99046863e8df49627776838e54,cea7aefdcc6d8787b681b4a9849fb612a357d8a4; a099e74bcfc047a1cff5a0e18b9585aaed0ce7ff; 36f60c50195f364df214be651888e2f0252f795b; b04096c0f77ddba2c694d5c03e6d83de9acab54c; 012c9bd335d02ca8b74f5106f4caa3ec26134cf6; adc7f15a2a55d1fb244528383344179e1304cf22; 15c790cfa8afff058ce02b342ebe20ee7c045750; 3cdd10b3b30d1e6b591807ea54eae0edc0fa980a; 84efabce518a777c404b8fbe5acd32060791428f; 5800894aa631837c684614c2e108da79f73af2a2; 4bd1e28516ede64d49ebf3be2e5467c7f474ce15; 7a02094aadf9707b0ded067b85a80873c5efedd5; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 1c49766cd3d2e19089fea703e579a73011946ac7; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 087f9482b1ad71e449c7ad758a3b235626168cc5; 9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6; d079bae158d4eb47f76a7a416ca9cccd2743e998; 6d05318d6ac2b5b902adf7db160de523d5902430; c9f56d5cfb9a2d6a83577276ff5b98d3e4ecc28c; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 9b38bf64a34519439edff4f90fe86b0947e64365,,,

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has provided a powerful tool in identifying the genetic variation and constructing the correlations between genotype and phenotype in humans and other species. However, for complex bacterial samples, there lacks a powerful bioinformatic tool to identify genetic polymorphisms or copy number variations (CNVs) for given genes. Here we provide a Bayesian framework for genotype estimation for mixtures of multiple bacteria, named as Genetic Polymorphisms Assignments (GPA). Simulation results showed that GPA has reduced the false discovery rate (FDR) and mean absolute error (MAE) in CNV and single nucleotide variant (SNV) identification. This framework was validated by whole-genome sequencing and Pool-seq data from Klebsiella pneumoniae with multiple bacteria mixture models, and showed the high accuracy in the allele fraction detections of CNVs and SNVs in AMR genes between two populations. The quantitative study on the changes of AMR genes fraction between two samples showed a good consistency with the AMR pattern observed in the individual strains. Also, the framework together with the genome annotation and population comparison tools has been integrated into an application, which could provide a complete solution for AMR gene identification and quantification in unculturable clinical samples.

05ca8bed54377ec25b8f17832124fc2d2b835557,Multiomics approach reveals metabolic changes in the heart at birth.,"During late gestation, the fetal heart primarily relies on glucose and lactate to support rapid growth and development. Although numerous studies describe changes in heart metabolism to utilize fatty acids preferentially a few weeks after birth, little is known about metabolic changes of the heart within the first day following birth. Therefore, we used the ovine model of pregnancy to investigate metabolic differences between the near-term fetal and the newborn heart. Heart tissue was collected for metabolomic, lipidomic, and transcriptomic approaches from the left and right ventricles and intraventricular septum in 7 fetuses at gestational day 142 and 7 newborn lambs on the day of birth. Significant metabolites and lipids were identified using a Student's t-test, whereas differentially expressed genes were identified using a moderated t-test with empirical Bayes method [false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P < 0.10]. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was used to identify pathways enriched on a transcriptomic level (FDR-corrected P < 0.05), whereas overrepresentation enrichment analysis was used to identify pathways enriched on a metabolomic level ( P < 0.05). We observed greater abundance of metabolites involved in butanoate and propanoate metabolism, and glycolysis in the term fetal heart and differential expression in these pathways were confirmed with ssGSEA. Immediately following birth, newborn hearts displayed enrichment in purine, fatty acid, and glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways as well as oxidative phosphorylation with significant alterations in both lipids and metabolites to support transcriptomic findings. A better understanding of metabolic alterations that occur in the heart following birth may improve treatment of neonates at risk for heart failure.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jacquelyn M.

8f70bb94fab21e802b264f319cedde7a39830e2b,"Based on Molecular Profiling of Gene Expression, Palmoplantar Pustulosis and Palmoplantar Pustular Psoriasis Are Highly Related Diseases that Appear to Be Distinct from Psoriasis Vulgaris","INTRODUCTION
There is a controversy surrounding the existence of palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) and palmoplantar pustular psoriasis (PPPP) as separate clinical entities or as variants of the same clinical entity. We used gene expression microarray to compare gene expression in PPP and PPPP.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Skin biopsies from subjects with PPP (3), PPPP (6), psoriasis vulgaris (10) and acral skin from normal subjects (7) were analyzed using gene expression microarray. Principal component analysis showed that PPP and PPPP were different from psoriasis vulgaris and normal acral skin. However gene expression of PPP and PPPP clustered together and could not be used to differentiate PPP from PPPP. Gene-wise comparison between PPP and PPPP found no gene to be differentially expressed at a false discovery rate lower than 0.05. Surprisingly we found a higher expression of several genes involved in neural pathways (e.g. GPRIN and ADAM23) in PPP/PPPP as compared to psoriasis vulgaris and normal acral skin. Immunohistochemistry confirmed those findings and showed a keratinocyte localization for those proteins.


CONCLUSION SIGNIFICANCE
PPP and PPPP could not be differentiated using gene expression microarray suggesting that they are not distinct clinical entities. Increased expression of GPRIN1, and ADAM23 in keratinocytes suggests that these proteins could be new therapeutic targets for PPP/PPPP.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Robert Bissonnette"", ids = ""40648138""); list(name = ""Mayte SuÃ¡rez-FariÃ±as"", ids = ""14842374""); list(name = ""X.

The organization of proteins into macromolecular complexes and their quantitative distribution across these complexes is, therefore, of great biological and clinical significance. In this paper we describe an integrated experimental and computational technique to quantify hundreds of protein complexes in a single operation. The method consists of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to fractionate native protein complexes, SWATH/DIA mass spectrometry to precisely quantify the proteins in each SEC fraction and the computational framework CCprofiler to detect and quantify protein complexes by error-controlled, complex-centric analysis using prior information from generic protein interaction maps. Our analysis of the HEK293 cell line proteome delineates 462 complexes composed of 2127 protein subunits. The technique identifies novel subcomplexes and assembly intermediates of central regulatory complexes while assessing the quantitative subunit distribution across them. We make the toolset CCprofiler freely accessible, and provide a web platform, SECexplorer, for custom exploration of the HEK293 proteome modularity.

66afda5692fec65c3a868321a3cf8ffe4351b26b,The relationship between the leptin/ghrelin ratio and meals with various macronutrient contents in men with different nutritional status: a randomized crossover study,"BackgroundHormones, which influence satiety and hunger, play a significant role in body energy balance regulation. Ghrelin is a peptide that plays an important role in short-term appetite regulation, whereas leptin is a factor that controls long-term energy balance and is considered as a satiety hormone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the leptin/ghrelin ratio in a fasting state and after the intake of meals with varying macronutrient contents and to assess the possible differences between normal body weight and overweight/obese men.MethodsWe examined 46 healthy adult men (23 with normal body weight and 23 overweight/obese) aged 21â€“58, who were divided into two groups. In the crossover study, participants received isocaloric (450â€‰kcal) meals with different macronutrient contents: men from the first group received high-carbohydrate (HC) and normo-carbohydrate (NC) meals, and in the second group, participants received high-carbohydrate and high-fat (HF) meals. The ratio of leptin/ghrelin levels was calculated from leptin and total ghrelin serum concentrations in a fasting state and 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240â€‰min after meal intake. One-way ANOVA and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were carried out. The normality of the variable distribution was checked with the Shapiroâ€“Wilk test, the homogeneity of variances was verified with the Levene test, and the false discovery rate p-value adjustment method was used.ResultsThe leptin/ghrelin ratio was significantly higher in overweight/obese men than individuals with normal body weight in a fasting state, as well as postprandially. We observed trends towards a higher leptin/ghrelin ratio values from the 60â€‰min after HC-meal intake compared to the NC- and HF-meals in normal body weight participants, while in overweight/obese men, we did not note any significant differences dependent on the meal type.ConclusionsWe have observed a significantly different postprandial leptin/ghrelin ratio in normal body weight and overweight/obese men, and our results suggest that in men with normal body weight, a greater feeling of satiety may occur after high-carbohydrate meal intake, which was not noted in the overweight/obese individuals.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Edyta Adamska-Patruno"", ids = ""1404096867""); list(name = ""Lucyna Ostrowska"", ids = ""74248838""); list(name = ""Joanna Goscik"", ids = ""70025394""); list(name = ""Barbara Pietraszewska"", ids = ""41125259""); list(name = ""Adam KrÄ\231towski"", ids = ""3946176""); list(name = ""Maria GÃ³rska"", ids = ""153876413"")",a2d78e6254d9ff1d9b525593153b06301c5cbf23; 2b8bef9421441d6ff030be0f2188e11f722a1af0; d6f656b92daa1d8677de01cc38b421c9b75fabf1; 709fd3dfa5903a10d4b88f30fea4351b517c069d,df7e07a4cc6ead7ab5e71e533793b386d961a91e; 66fd23216bd4ee28959e2bfccbaf7e8fce1fecfc; 8109a1a7300d0cf253d47086be4c42bc6148826c; bdff68d5c2354756d2ec168dea16b6265d013a01; e8631f39fe5b5b8304eb313d1a8427bb5988ef28; d74ded26067e27d54577e9cef7c713f3c430431d; 49671a5f71e2146d29cfb71080452126b0f004fe; f704c6746b58a287df0cb60a4229b44c270baaf0; 95bdf8d938480ca2a68a10b7083ebae41453e569; b4201da41302c4493ab8b133c44c3f2e3818d2c9; bdb5beeca07a276cd550c42e1a0c7e32a4aae0cf; b123d66ec295612554ae2b8fba49e18da1d56181; a06e1db327ff10b38fc794ebeab9b0ea0e5a29fa; a74b4ecc357f24d9ac723d8987a06be6fe68bcf2; 2203bf1c3f854c956e12c729ead923044efcf8e3; f8e3940992e33fe5717e8f84bd2164f91c554dba; 525f9a0bd140765864862794186ffcb3816d5d20; a08425b9eb5241904ac17edc533989c98a07b966; 73ed8e1486202a839cd0a9efd90dc7b55906e796; 2f495614b2d00471b98d20fa9f9ed7809c5923af; 735bea42642f53ba1dd469c8dfe54477be51d562; 3ef5219a5f91f2dc823c3aca222b718c672b79ef; 1dacbdcd027fd76e013cda5b5f89898becbbe182; 4de11df88ac5ffa5ca89219bd805008375767b95; a96a06c78eb70bfb2ead7a7d3c214ef7cc852949; 072db9a855da2a0ffda9d7acb485a14ea2f823dc; caf26bffc40054205a31a17d32c82ebe9d90b8cc; d5252b6beec82b284c28fe1181c4ff12af757c17; 8d72da029be116c6d8058803129ec52a29071b4f,Nutrition Journal,17,

Although the burden of IC on the American public is immense in both human and financial terms, there is no clear diagnostic test for IC, but rather it is a disease of exclusion. Very little is known about the clinically useful urinary biomarkers of IC, which are desperately needed. Untargeted comprehensive metabolomic profiling was performed using gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry to compare urine specimens of IC patients or health donors. The study profiled 200 known and 290 unknown metabolites. The majority of the thirty significantly changed metabolites before false discovery rate correction were unknown compounds. Partial least square discriminant analysis clearly separated IC patients from controls. The high number of unknown compounds hinders useful biological interpretation of such predictive models. Given that urine analyses have great potential to be adapted in clinical practice, research has to be focused on the identification of unknown compounds to uncover important clues about underlying disease mechanisms.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tobias Kind"", ids = ""32857381""); list(name = ""Eunho Cho"", ids = ""49645664""); list(name = ""Taeeun D.

367038c61b00699694adbd9c46a0ba5bfc2991b2,Genetic Variants in Epigenetic Pathways and Risks of Multiple Cancers in the GAME-ON Consortium.,"Background: Epigenetic disturbances are crucial in cancer initiation, potentially with pleiotropic effects, and may be influenced by the genetic background.Methods: In a subsets (ASSET) meta-analytic approach, we investigated associations of genetic variants related to epigenetic mechanisms with risks of breast, lung, colorectal, ovarian and prostate carcinomas using 51,724 cases and 52,001 controls. False discovery rate-corrected P values (q values < 0.05) were considered statistically significant.Results: Among 162,887 imputed or genotyped variants in 555 candidate genes, SNPs in eight genes were associated with risk of more than one cancer type. For example, variants in BABAM1 were confirmed as a susceptibility locus for squamous cell lung, overall breast, estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast, and overall prostate, and overall serous ovarian cancer; the most significant variant was rs4808076 [OR = 1.14; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-1.19; q = 6.87 Ã— 10-5]. DPF1 rs12611084 was inversely associated with ER-negative breast, endometrioid ovarian, and overall and aggressive prostate cancer risk (OR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.91-0.96; q = 0.005). Variants in L3MBTL3 were associated with colorectal, overall breast, ER-negative breast, clear cell ovarian, and overall and aggressive prostate cancer risk (e.g., rs9388766: OR = 1.06; 95% CI = 1.03-1.08; q = 0.02). Variants in TET2 were significantly associated with overall breast, overall prostate, overall ovarian, and endometrioid ovarian cancer risk, with rs62331150 showing bidirectional effects. Analyses of subpathways did not reveal gene subsets that contributed disproportionately to susceptibility.Conclusions: Functional and correlative studies are now needed to elucidate the potential links between germline genotype, epigenetic function, and cancer etiology.Impact: This approach provides novel insight into possible pleiotropic effects of genes involved in epigenetic processes.

The objective of this study was to identify microRNAs and downstream enriched targets associated with symptomatic carotid plaques. Carotid plaque samples from patients were defined as symptomatic if they were associated with a prior ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, or as asymptomatic if there were no prior ischemic events. Digital microRNA profiling was performed on the NanoString nCounter analysis system (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA) on carotid plaques from symptomatic (n=6) and asymptomatic (n=6) patients. We used the BioConductor/R package ""edgeR"" to perform moderated-ANOVA testing for differences in gene abundance between groups, assuming a negative binomial distribution of gene counts, with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple hypothesis correction to control false discovery rate. Analysis revealed five microRNAs that were significantly up-regulated in the symptomatic cohort (see Table 1) including miR-16, which was confirmed by RTqPCR (p=0.02). Predicted downstream targets of miR-16 were enriched for proteoglycan related genes including hyaluronan synthase 2, perlecan and betaglycan. Additionally, RTqPCR demonstrated up-regulation of CathepsinB transcript in symptomatic patients (n=46-50 per cohort, p=0.02) while CathepsinL and heparanase transcripts were not significantly different. CathepsinL enzyme activity was also not significantly different (n=46-50 per cohort). Taken together, these findings may reveal novel proteoglycan mediated signaling pathways, mediated through miR-16, regulating the progression of carotid plaque formation.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Neeta Adhikari"", ids = ""4914263""); list(name = ""Marjorie Carlson"", ids = ""145744245""); list(name = ""Amir Lerman"", ids = ""123485234""); list(name = ""Darrell Loeffler"", ids = ""39879213""); list(name = ""Dinesha Walek"", ids = ""48151158""); list(name = ""Jerry Daniel"", ids = ""145516264""); list(name = ""Aaron J.

52d69bf2753512baa9bee124dd84764d6164d79a,Genome-wide significance for dense SNP and resequencing data.,"The problem of multiple testing is an important aspect of genome-wide association studies, and will become more important as marker densities increase. The problem has been tackled with permutation and false discovery rate procedures and with Bayes factors, but each approach faces difficulties that we briefly review. In the current context of multiple studies on different genotyping platforms, we argue for the use of truly genome-wide significance thresholds, based on all polymorphisms whether or not typed in the study. We approximate genome-wide significance thresholds in contemporary West African, East Asian and European populations by simulating sequence data, based on all polymorphisms as well as for a range of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection criteria. Overall we find that significance thresholds vary by a factor of >20 over the SNP selection criteria and statistical tests that we consider and can be highly dependent on sample size. We compare our results for sequence data to those derived by the HapMap Consortium and find notable differences which may be due to the small sample sizes used in the HapMap estimate.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Clive J.

Introduction. In this study we investigated the metabolic consequences of U0126, a highly selective MEK1/2 inhibitor, in human prostate and breast cancer cell lines using 1H and 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and gene expression data.

Methods. Prostate (PC3 and LNCaP) and breast (MCF7) human cancer cells were treated for 48 h with the IC50 dose of U0126. 1H MRS data were acquired from cell extracts and repeated univariate statistical testing with false discovery rate correction was performed to determine significant changes in metabolite levels. The rate of glycolysis was determined from dynamic studies in live cells using 13C MRS to monitor the metabolism of 1-13C-labeled glucose. Protein and gene expression levels were measured using Western blotting and microarray analysis.

Results and Discussion. The effect of U0126 was confirmed by western blot analysis demonstrating a drop in p-ERK. The univariate statistical analysis revealed that the 48 h drug treatment induced several metabolic changes including depletion of intracellular aspartate, succinate and phosphocholine in the prostate cells. However, one of the most significant metabolic change in all three cell lines was a substantial increase in intracellular lactate levels following treatment, with lactate up 134Â±16% (p=0.002), 149Â±20% (p=0.001) and 213Â±43% (n=2) of control in PC3, LNCaP and MCF7 cells respectively. Dynamic studies in live MCF7 cells were in line with the extract data and showed that the rate of lactate production increased following treatment 169Â±43% from 260Â±98 fmol/cell/hour to 439Â±114 fmol/cell/hour (p=0.03). Preliminary studies in PC3 cells showed a similar trend.

Consistent with the metabolic observations, overexpression of genes associated with glycolysis including PFKFB3, PDK1, HK2, and GLUT1 was observed in PC3 cells pointing to an increase in glycolytic enzymes induced by U0126 treatment. In an effort to explain this observation we assessed the expression of other signaling proteins and found that although U0126 inhibits its target kinase, increased Akt phosphorylation was also observed in the PC3 cells. Importantly Akt activation was previously reported to mediate an increase in glycolysis. We therefore hypothesize that the observed increases in lactate production and its intracellular accumulation following inhibition of MAPK kinase signaling result from activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway observed in our cells.

Conclusion. Deregulation of the MAPK pathway is often involved in oncogenesis, and therefore inhibitors of the pathway are being investigated as targeted cancer therapeutics. Our results highlight the value of MRS in identifying metabolic consequences of treatment that may inform on molecular drug action.

A sample splitting step is incorporated to modify that approach where one part of the data is used for model fitting and the other part for detecting the significant cases by a screening technique featuring the empirical Bayes mode of Fdr control. Cases with high detection frequency across repeated random sample splits are considered true discoveries. A critical detection frequency is set to control the overall false discovery rate. The proposed method helps to balance out unwanted sources of variation and addresses potential statistical overfitting of the core empirical model by cross-validation through resampling. Further, concurrent detection frequencies are used to provide visual tools to explore the inter-relationship between significant cases. The methodology is illustrated using a microarray data set, RNA-sequencing data set, and several simulation studies. A power analysis is presented to understand the efficiency of the proposed method.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Paramita Chakraborty"", ids = ""145173269""); list(name = ""Chong Ma"", ids = ""49679389""); list(name = ""John Grego"", ids = ""3439951""); list(name = ""James F.

A notable application is the detection of changes in transcript usage between experimental conditions. For example, discovery of pathological alternative splicing may allow the development of new treatments or better management of patients. From an analysis perspective, there are several ways to approach RNA-seq data to unravel differential transcript usage, such as annotation-based exon-level counting, differential analysis of the percentage spliced in, or quantitative analysis of assembled transcripts. The goal of this research is to compare and contrast current state-of-the-art methods, and to suggest improvements to commonly used work flows.ResultsWe assess the performance of representative work flows using synthetic data and explore the effect of using non-standard counting bin definitions as input to DEXSeq, a state-of-the-art inference engine. Although the canonical counting provided the best results overall, several non-canonical approaches were as good or better in specific aspects and most counting approaches outperformed the evaluated event- and assembly-based methods. We show that an incomplete annotation catalog can have a detrimental effect on the ability to detect differential transcript usage in transcriptomes with few isoforms per gene and that isoform-level prefiltering can considerably improve false discovery rate control.ConclusionCount-based methods generally perform well in the detection of differential transcript usage.

48b4032a0de32aedd89ade32e2e09f59e116e447,Identification of genetic loci shared between schizophrenia and the Big Five personality traits,"Schizophrenia is associated with differences in personality traits, and recent studies suggest that personality traits and schizophrenia share a genetic basis. Here we aimed to identify specific genetic loci shared between schizophrenia and the Big Five personality traits using a Bayesian statistical framework. Using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on personality traits in the 23andMe cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰59,225) and schizophrenia in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰82,315), we evaluated overlap in common genetic variants. The Big Five personality traits neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness were measured using a web implementation of the Big Five Inventory. Applying the conditional false discovery rate approach, we increased discovery of genetic loci and identified two loci shared between neuroticism and schizophrenia and six loci shared between openness and schizophrenia.

0f9daf1312a03ad96823612664c368b922d944aa,Orthognathic surgery induces genomewide changes longitudinally in DNA methylation in saliva.,"OBJECTIVE
Orthognathic surgery dramatically changes morphology of the maxillofacial deformity and improves the malocclusion morphologically and functionally. We investigated the influence of orthognathic surgery on genomewide DNA methylation in saliva.


METHODS
Saliva was obtained from nine patients undergoing orthognathic surgery and two healthy reference individuals before and 3Â months after orthognathic surgery. Genomewide DNA methylation profiling of saliva (341,482 CpG dinucleotides) was conducted using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips.


RESULTS
Comparison between pre- and postsurgery saliva samples revealed significant changes in DNA methylation patterns at 2,381 CpG sites (pÂ <Â 0.01) with suggestive significance. The differentially methylated probe sets were significantly associated with the cancer pathway (pÂ =Â 2.8Â Ã—Â 10-7 ; a false discovery rate q-valueÂ =Â 3.7Â Ã—Â 10-4 ) and PI3K-Akt signalling pathway (pÂ =Â 2.4Â Ã—Â 10-5 ; a false discovery rate q-valueÂ =Â 3.1Â Ã—Â 10-2 ).


CONCLUSION
Pathway enrichment analysis of genes with suggestive significance demonstrated that altered DNA methylation in saliva of patients undergoing orthognathic surgery, possibly as a response to surgical stress or bone injury. Further studies with a large sample size and long-term observation are needed to validate the phenomena identified in this study.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tetsutaro Yamaguchi"", ids = ""2757962""); list(name = ""Kazuyoshi Hosomichi"", ids = ""5380162""); list(name = ""Masahiro Takahashi"", ids = ""10296088""); list(name = ""Shugo Haga"", ids = ""5373506""); list(name = ""Takatoshi Nakawaki"", ids = ""8781141""); list(name = ""Yu Hikita"", ids = ""48643858""); list(name = ""Koutaro Maki"", ids = ""1978774""); list(name = ""Atsushi Tajima"", ids = ""2091182"")",,,Oral diseases,25 2,"

d1b9a0f0a2619eef9ca66d4dd16d02c1520a1a4e,Ultra-high throughput sequencing-based small RNA discovery and discrete statistical biomarker analysis in a collection of cervical tumours and matched controls,"BackgroundUltra-high throughput sequencing technologies provide opportunities both for discovery of novel molecular species and for detailed comparisons of gene expression patterns. Small RNA populations are particularly well suited to this analysis, as many different small RNAs can be completely sequenced in a single instrument run.ResultsWe prepared small RNA libraries from 29 tumour/normal pairs of human cervical tissue samples. Analysis of the resulting sequences (42 million in total) defined 64 new human microRNA (miRNA) genes. Both arms of the hairpin precursor were observed in twenty-three of the newly identified miRNA candidates. We tested several computational approaches for the analysis of class differences between high throughput sequencing datasets and describe a novel application of a log linear model that has provided the most effective analysis for this data. This method resulted in the identification of 67 miRNAs that were differentially-expressed between the tumour and normal samples at a false discovery rate less than 0.001.ConclusionsThis approach can potentially be applied to any kind of RNA sequencing data for analysing differential sequence representation between biological sample sets.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniela M.

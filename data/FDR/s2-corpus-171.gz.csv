9ada254ec5c14b872817974bd4904404be33ef8f,"A sectioning and database enrichment approach for improved peptide spectrum matching in large, genome-guided protein sequence databases","Multi-omics approaches focused on mass-spectrometry (MS)-based data, such as metaproteomics, utilize genomic and/or transcriptomic sequencing data to generate a comprehensive protein sequence database. These databases can be very large, containing millions of sequences, which reduces the sensitivity of matching tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data to sequences to generate peptide spectrum matches (PSMs). Here, we describe a sectioning method for generating an enriched database for those protein sequences that are most likely present in the sample. Our evaluation demonstrates how this method helps to increase the sensitivity of PSMs while maintaining acceptable false discovery rate statistics. We demonstrate increased true positive PSM identifications using the sectioning method when compared to the traditional large database searching method, whereas it helped in reducing the false PSM identifications when compared to a previously described two-step method for reducing database size. The sectioning method for large sequence databases enables generation of an enriched protein sequence database and promotes increased sensitivity in identifying PSMs, while maintaining acceptable and manageable FDR. Furthermore, implementation in the Galaxy platform provides access to a usable and automated workflow for carrying out the method. Our results show the utility of this methodology for a wide-range of applications where genome-guided, large sequence databases are required for MS-based proteomics data analysis.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Praveen Kumar"", ids = ""152220814""); list(name = ""James R.

7a99ff9703d237f10d8179ca5e2aff668d1d4263,Association between DNA methylation in cord blood and maternal smoking: The Hokkaido Study on Environment and Childrenâ€™s Health,"Maternal smoking is reported to cause adverse effects on the health of the unborn child, the underlying mechanism for which is thought to involve alterations in DNA methylation. We examined the effects of maternal smoking on DNA methylation in cord blood, in 247 motherâ€“infant pairs in the Sapporo cohort of the Hokkaido Study, using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip. We first identified differentially methylated CpG sites with a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05 and the magnitude of DNA methylation changes (|Î²| >0.02) from the pairwise comparisons of never-smokers (Ne-S), sustained-smokers (Su-S), and stopped-smokers (St-S). Subsequently, secondary comparisons between St-S and Su-S revealed nine common sites that mapped to ACSM3, AHRR, CYP1A1, GFI1, SHANK2, TRIM36, and the intergenic region between ANKRD9 and RCOR1 in Ne-S vs. Su-S, and one common CpG site mapping to EVC2 in Ne-S vs. St-S. Further, we verified these CpG sites and examined neighbouring sites using bisulfite next-generation sequencing, except for AHRR cg21161138. These changes in DNA methylation implicate the effect of smoking cessation. Our findings add to the current knowledge of the association between DNA methylation and maternal smoking and suggest future studies for clarifying this relationship in disease development.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kunio Miyake"", ids = ""5242261""); list(name = ""Akio Kawaguchi"", ids = ""50755347""); list(name = ""Ryu Miura"", ids = ""50119750""); list(name = ""Sachiko Kobayashi"", ids = ""46966412""); list(name = ""Nguyen Quoc Vuong Tran"", ids = ""47878264""); list(name = ""Sumitaka Kobayashi"", ids = ""4610397""); list(name = ""Chihiro Miyashita"", ids = ""6532445""); list(name = ""Atsuko Araki"", ids = ""2080199""); list(name = ""Takeo Kubota"", ids = ""6808867""); list(name = ""Zentaro Yamagata"", ids = ""6248409""); list(name = ""Reiko Kishi"", ids = ""6670092"")",dc4b0e507c4b9d5fa7cd38aa066b8fe5a7550b04; e41032002ce001c6e037e279647acefaeaffec18; 5effa0509586b1718b583d067452f7120004d32c; ea8ca78dd3a7f42c161c37647c14e6343f90f259; a9f64775d22da2a21452035cff34e94aabebc38f,c9bb18d3dd14925dbd70001b9f33bfa2fd1f9a8f; 2dd740a8a65ffb629931c847697a2b34925fd90e; 54182f8fcbcfe7ed06d4798fd3f7bbc052cb67f0; 9074fd57d591019b79fb23c637e8c92b82d0bf22; b86d7c1cdc1533182fd76eb45af1e0dc5d081dac; 0886c1aa2c523e74afef42beb332ecf35f546830; 5c68496b1a29396e6acd15c1c4af318b5608b926; c62a5135fb3e02a9c0c503ba6e26584a3b4c10e0; 2fc546a340101eb20d834da96c827d7e83090129; 6ef5048989079cc4367c266c984ae1f072a293a9; 975f1a2dc6cc10d8b56c074469dc076837a010e0; da5bd139b0b0431d2c2611b8b4ba1f00a5b22f09; 948990c2095c6c9958b638d0ada9a8e7c4a35276; 193a5151466c5ea34555b278b4cb1d44225df394; 16cf6f149a90cc14a2559b74673b5bade3f7460c; f755f8cffd90f6b0dc0ac789d471ddce3fb960c3; 70b8d894993a03bf35fb787db239d98672a42cb8; f7eafd7aff2a37b014c44c6871b41fcf30c68ad8; b1f4e674032ba85df9ed2390c262e42a2d548f7a; 8d3669e422e4500a0663f9b93e9386c5885be2ed; 8b208d277b62355a30dbee112e5629bd64637c0b; a81fd86ab87c8395729593d69905e3b3639f5bb8; 521193f4f60588e43a9cca9679e0b056fabb1c0c; 9fcdb337b803d2dea562afa9ea93d119807ab8a6; 84cb15ad168265aa82108556abbf5cb1ad5c0229; 4514276d703ffde089869764893c6f3fcb27bb08; 426a99dc9880d5129e75064af4058d2f4d30baad; 8d3a67293ee18039f4bd579c03f255409299c41f; d05e47e47c54b82af9e1154c5afb74c4c51233cb; a94ea54d4a06ba79136eb49408f6976aaeb82a03; 18553325cdfdcd293470f8a20658717c9c9ba453; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; 567bb1d7b0c80ee919fc3f6e4a8e28361d5e188c; bb8e38aece81c0572e1fc0128d0dd56a5d53a1c2; 7641ae95495f188c48fe5dc9cb2e2d47c6c376a4; a5ac166ca3415f0effc791b34d15f24169f7d206; 2aee86d5bf73138010a76536183d896a7a5a3200; d6c0ac4225604fb79e9bc03e40d19cfaddc0134b; 11cc3c2465919f2fcc00fa8f89c9644f484c5d8b; c84cf3153df89a3e9b7baf597884affac27d0391; 48af8d5e30953560e3c67a8c1272cbb83de264d5; 9445d4a23b2d610b1d6a922c67d0348886494a9e; 25eaa8252e1c15cc798766de5c886fd424707b6f; 5d572bd996809a739cbfc9f4c0e6ebd1697751d2; e6eeae6b860be7c885698868719a22b5b49ad46f; 5a943e4aab141b7494421118ddc9be2def331190; 778c1718cdc1ef3d9a61e7037a51cf019702a0de; c1a4dc04a23ce65cd52743246e0e8f57b6ce0c4c; 2aadd847262e242d29866984a2d6940e17ecf96b; 75dc0caa22bf462fec1b0e68307b78b9cbd6078d; 9b27bd9ec495b2617e4598c95d836aa7793ac148; e71f1c7012a7605ab8fafe4d2520c8d9f63376e3; 3000f6ddc9a937014a1ac4d426d8c1de1be21f2b; ae0e45c277ae7c8cc63d6558a7db5ebb43b5a2b9; a723f65779afc5b8262a3743f859d16d2ebffc1c; 0db358dc85a85084b95a8a781e188a40f1f8f136; d276a59508031a52115720666e278ad40231c598; 17eb1440fef05d8983f68bdf3d173c1301c1566c; f85de3ac5108fccc00176ab2ec43373edf3173af; 07f5ac059c03bd028f93f36e1f47cb3f60bde08a; 4cd95cfb723f0647b96851608df02bfc47fb40c4; 83683004ff1ea7093a8db71e48d317bfefecac36; 00fc4db14a7ccc6c2b003d8b74f7feb202b541dc,Scientific Reports,8,
c5ff955833ff44e0ec923004c8924d1b1d52c397,miRNA-Processing Gene Methylation and Cancer Risk.,"Background: Dysregulation of miRNA and methylation levels are epigenetic hallmarks of cancer, potentially linked via miRNA-processing genes. Studies have found genetic alterations to miRNA-processing genes in cancer cells and human population studies. Our objective was to prospectively examine changes in DNA methylation of miRNA-processing genes and their associations with cancer risk.Methods: We examined cohort data from the Department of Veterans' Affairs Normative Aging Study. Participants were assessed every 3 to 5 years starting in 1999 through 2013 including questionnaires, medical record review, and blood collection. Blood from 686 consenting participants was analyzed using the Illumina 450K BeadChip array to measure methylation at CpG sites throughout the genome. We selected 19 genes based on a literature review, with 519 corresponding CpG sites. We then used Cox proportional hazards models to examine associations with cancer incidence, and generalized estimating equations to examine associations with cancer prevalence. Associations at false discovery rate < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Results: Methylation of three CpGs (DROSHA: cg23230564, TNRC6B: cg06751583, and TNRC6B: cg21034183) was prospectively associated with time to cancer development (positively for cg06751583, inversely for cg23230564 and cg21034183), whereas methylation of one CpG site (DROSHA: cg16131300) was positively associated with cancer prevalence.Conclusions: DNA methylation of DROSHA, a key miRNA-processing gene, and TNRC6B may play a role in early carcinogenesis.Impact: Changes in miRNA processing may exert multiple effects on cancer development, including protecting against it via altered global miRNAs, and may be a useful early detection biomarker of cancer.

cc91dd61834335a62b4da66498786438b00b1cda,An overview of the computational analyses and discovery of transcription factor binding sites.,"Here we provide a pragmatic, high-level overview of the computational approaches and tools for the discovery of transcription factor binding sites. Unraveling transcription regulatory networks and their malfunctions such as cancer became feasible due to recent stellar progress in experimental techniques and computational analyses. While predictions of isolated sites still pose notorious challenges, cis-regulatory modules (clusters) of binding sites can now be identified with high accuracy. Further support comes from conserved DNA segments, co-regulation, transposable elements, nucleosomes, and three-dimensional chromosomal structures. We introduce computational tools for the analysis and interpretation of chromatin immunoprecipitation, next-generation sequencing, SELEX, and protein-binding microarray results. Because immunoprecipitation produces overly large DNA segments and well over half of the sequencing reads from constitute background noise, methods are presented for background correction, sequence read mapping, peak calling, false discovery rate estimation, and co-localization analyses. To discover short binding site motifs from extensive immunoprecipitation segments, we recommend algorithms and software based on expectation maximization and Gibbs sampling. Data integration using several databases further improves performance. Binding sites can be visualized in genomic and chromatin context using genome browsers. Binding site information, integrated with co-expression in large compendia of gene expression experiments, allows us to reveal complex transcriptional regulatory networks.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""IstvÃ¡n Ladunga"", ids = ""3225728"")",21252d51266cc4abcbb17cff08f592e74b9038ed; fce27c66e8ab185037e5d6a7a20ebd51144bc9a2; 4533699cfb27e3c93e037898363302d8f905b9bd; 72cfc5f141a1d0c932661b1a900322d75d3267a7; f44e400950783997ba80a24fbd1792f4e4a83081; d4c3f58852298bc8c0099e643fda5d2862fbcd5d; d7c2ef3d94b7c2693a3873fd5fe6d15fb415f88e; 51edd84aa03882ff5ff3eb62cc96d59d1bba3305; 7e839af40fbf712c9a1ebf0ce27a9f757ffc5754; 6451eec23b5c3162f740bab38113cfe3695376bf; c1a991c8e2331b7166d2163d2f4ae8e6cd2eeb1a; 1dd623cedc3845bd9812423ecdc6e4fcb6fb976a; 6b165aba4ad700774a80cbf5caa6665509075ff2; 7144f114db8c7a4aa089f41a09142ad0633ffeda; 2e6f8cc62730faa0afde0227e1a5a8556ad596e0,,Methods in molecular biology,674,"

966d4501197b06c287a1396deeac414055bdd685,Host Microarray Molecular Signature and Serologic Evaluation of Stages of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane regulator gene (CFTR); lung disease is characterized by chronic infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. However, oropharyngeal cultures for P. aeruginosa in young children result in poor specificity for lower airway infection. We used a novel approach to generate genomewide expression profiles to identify markers for P. aeruginosa infection and CF disease severity. Transcription was induced in healthy unrelated peripheral blood mononuclear cells through coculture with autologous serum (self-baseline control), allogeneic serums (healthy unrelated controls), and serums from patients with CF. 
 
Methodology: All CF diagnoses included sweat chloride levels greater than or equal to 60 mEq/L and/or two CFTR mutations. We performed various ELISAs against 192 serum samples (43 individuals sampled over 15 years) and comparative cultures. Concurrently, we completed expression profiling of RNA (HU133 plus 2.0 array; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) from coculture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the serum of patients with CF, who possessed increasing degrees of colonization with P. aeruginosa. Differentially expressed probe sets were defined as those possessing a false discovery rate less than 10% and |log2 ratio| greater than 0.5 among comparison groups. 
 
Results: Our ELISA data indicated that the host response to P. aeruginosa infection increased over time, suggesting that serology to P. aeruginosa may help determine initial airway pathology. Comparison of array signatures performed before and after seroconversion identified several hundred unique genes; the most significant differences in gene expression included host genes involved with airway defense, antigen presentation, and transcription. 
 
Conclusions: Our methodology consistently identified a small number of genes that were unique to patients with CF or to patients with CF with initial P. aeruginosa infection conversion. These genes merit investigation as active participants in the function of the lung microbiome and may serve as therapeutic targets for P. aeruginosa infection in CF.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hara Levy"", ids = ""36981552""); list(name = ""Melissa Reske"", ids = ""34531674""); list(name = ""Rachel Bersie"", ids = ""11304722""); list(name = ""Joseph T.

44deb078143af3399a2fc449ac4342532d3bc100,Multiplex proteomics for prediction of major cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes,"Aims/hypothesisMultiplex proteomics could improve understanding and risk prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in type 2 diabetes. This study assessed 80 cardiovascular and inflammatory proteins for biomarker discovery and prediction of MACE in type 2 diabetes.MethodsWe combined data from six prospective epidemiological studies of 30â€“77-year-old individuals with type 2 diabetes in whom 80 circulating proteins were measured by proximity extension assay. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression was used in a discovery/replication design to identify biomarkers for incident MACE. We used gradient-boosted machine learning and lasso regularised Cox regression in a random 75% training subsample to assess whether adding proteins to risk factors included in the Swedish National Diabetes Register risk model would improve the prediction of MACE in the separate 25% test subsample.ResultsOf 1211 adults with type 2 diabetes (32% women), 211 experienced a MACE over a mean (Â±SD) of 6.4â€‰Â±â€‰2.3Â years. We replicated associations (<5% false discovery rate) between risk of MACE and eight proteins: matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12, IL-27 subunit Î± (IL-27a), kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23, protein S100-A12, TNF receptor (TNFR)-1, TNFR-2 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAIL-R)2. Addition of the 80-protein assay to established risk factors improved discrimination in the separate test sample from 0.686 (95% CI 0.682, 0.689) to 0.748 (95% CI 0.746, 0.751). A sparse model of 20 added proteins achieved a C statistic of 0.747 (95% CI 0.653, 0.842) in the test sample.Conclusions/interpretationWe identified eight protein biomarkers, four of which are novel, for risk of MACE in community residents with type 2 diabetes, and found improved risk prediction by combining multiplex proteomics with an established risk model. Multiprotein arrays could be useful in identifying individuals with type 2 diabetes who are at highest risk of a cardiovascular event.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Christoph Nowak"", ids = ""47677990""); list(name = ""Axel C.

769f570e5c4817be13840ff163a1095b0ce5a06c,Identification of new protein coding sequences and signal peptidase cleavage sites of Helicobacter pylori strain 26695 by proteogenomics.,"UNLABELLED
Correct annotation of protein coding genes is the basis of conventional data analysis in proteomic studies. Nevertheless, most protein sequence databases almost exclusively rely on gene finding software and inevitably also miss protein annotations or possess errors. Proteogenomics tries to overcome these issues by matching MS data directly against a genome sequence database. Here we report an in-depth proteogenomics study of Helicobacter pylori strain 26695. MS data was searched against a combined database of the NCBI annotations and a six-frame translation of the genome. Database searches with Mascot and X! Tandem revealed 1115 proteins identified by at least two peptides with a peptide false discovery rate below 1%. This represents 71% of the predicted proteome. So far this is the most extensive proteome study of Helicobacter pylori. Our proteogenomic approach unambiguously identified four previously missed annotations and furthermore allowed us to correct sequences of six annotated proteins. Since secreted proteins are often involved in pathogenic processes we further investigated signal peptidase cleavage sites. By applying a database search that accommodates the identification of semi-specific cleaved peptides, 63 previously unknown signal peptides were detected. The motif LXA showed to be the predominant recognition sequence for signal peptidases.


BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
The results of MS-based proteomic studies highly rely on correct annotation of protein coding genes which is the basis of conventional data analysis. However, the annotation of protein coding sequences in genomic data is usually based on gene finding software. These tools are limited in their prediction accuracy such as the problematic determination of exact gene boundaries. Thus, protein databases own partly erroneous or incomplete sequences. Additionally, some protein sequences might also be missing in the databases. Proteogenomics, a combination of proteomic and genomic data analyses, is well suited to detect previously not annotated proteins and to correct erroneous sequences. For this purpose, the existing database of the investigated species is typically supplemented with a six-frame translation of the genome. Here, we studied the proteome of the major human pathogen Helicobacter pylori that is responsible for many gastric diseases such as duodenal ulcers and gastric cancer. Our in-depth proteomic study highly reliably identified 1115 proteins (FDR<0.01%) by at least two peptides (FDR<1%) which represent 71% of the predicted proteome deposited at NCBI. The proteogenomic data analysis of our data set resulted in the unambiguous identification of four previously missed annotations, the correction of six annotated proteins as well as the detection of 63 previously unknown signal peptides. We have annotated proteins of particular biological interest like the ferrous iron transport protein A, the coiled-coil-rich protein HP0058 and the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis protein HP0619. For instance, the protein HP0619 could be a drug target for the inhibition of the LPS synthesis pathway. Furthermore it has been proven that the motif ""LXA"" is the predominant recognition sequence for the signal peptidase I of H. pylori. Signal peptidases are essential enzymes for the viability of bacterial cells and are involved in pathogenesis. Therefore signal peptidases could be novel targets for antibiotics. The inclusion of the corrected and new annotated proteins as well as the information of signal peptide cleavage sites will help in the study of biological pathways involved in pathogenesis or drug response of H. pylori.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Stephan A MÃ¼ller"", ids = ""153387024""); list(name = ""Sven FindeiÃŸ"", ids = ""2767463""); list(name = ""Sandy R.

105629fc6a8034943cc0d4df6eab122cd664b5d2,Unpaired Data Empowers Association Tests,"To achieve a holistic view of the underlying mechanisms of human diseases, the biomedical research community is moving toward harvesting retrospective data available in Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs). The first step for causal understanding is to perform association tests between types of potentially high-dimensional biomedical data, such as genetic, blood biomarkers, and imaging data. To obtain a reasonable power, current methods require a substantial sample size of individuals with both data modalities. This prevents researchers from using much larger EHR samples that include individuals with at least one data type, limits the power of the association test, and may result in higher false discovery rate. We present a new method called the Semi-paired Association Test (SAT) that makes use of both paired and unpaired data. In contrast to classical approaches, incorporating unpaired data allows SAT to produce better control of false discovery and, under some conditions, improve the association test power. We study the properties of SAT theoretically and empirically, through simulations and application to real studies in the context of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Our method identifies an association between the high-dimensional characterization of Computed Tomography (CT) chest images and blood biomarkers as well as the expression of dozens of genes involved in the immune system.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Ming-ming Gong"", ids = ""50175298""); list(name = ""Peng Liu"", ids = ""1400300730""); list(name = ""Frank C.

We evaluated 121 polymorphisms to study a possible association between these SNPs and the response to ustekinumab (PASI75 at 4 months; n = 69). Results/Conclusion: The adjusted results (false discovery rate) showed an association between five SNPs in TNFRSF1A, HTR2A, NFKBIA, ADAM33 and IL13 genes, and poor response to ustekinumab. Furthermore, six SNPs in CHUK, C17orf51, ZNF816A, STAT4, SLC22A4 and Corf72 genes were associated with better response to ustekinumab. However, there was no significant association between response to ustekinumab and SNPs in HLA-C as it has been recently described. Finally, a higher weight was obtained in nonresponders than responders (p = 0.018).

57862daad9b0673b2cadde7415b83823c6e6762a,Reduced Visual Cortex Gray Matter Volume and Thickness in Young Adults Who Witnessed Domestic Violence during Childhood,"Exposure to interparental violence is associated with negative outcomes, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and reduced cognitive abilities. However, little is known about the potential effects of witnessing domestic violence during childhood on gray matter volume (GMV) or cortical thickness. High-resolution 3.0 T volumetric scans (Siemens Trio Scanner) were obtained on 52 subjects (18-25 years) including 22 (6 males/16 females) with a history of visually witnessing episodes of domestic violence, and 30 (8 males/22 females) unexposed control subjects, with neither a current nor past DSM-IV Axis I or II disorder. Potential confounding effects of age, gender, level of parental verbal aggression, parental education, financial stress, full scale IQ, and total GMV, or average thickness were modeled using voxel based morphometry and FreeSurfer. Witnessing domestic violence subjects had a 6.1% GMV reduction in the right lingual gyrus (BA18) (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.029, False Discovery Rate corrected peak level). Thickness in this region was also reduced, as was thickness in V2 bilaterally and left occipital pole. Theses regions were maximally sensitive to exposure to witnessing domestic violence between 11-13 years of age. Regional reductions in GMV and thickness were observed in both susceptible and resilient witnessing domestic violence subjects. Results in subjects witnessing domestic violence were similar to previously reported results in subjects with childhood sexual abuse, as the primary region affected was visual cortex. Brain regions that process and convey the adverse sensory input of the abuse may be specifically modified by this experience, particularly in subjects exposed to a single type of maltreatment. Exposure to multiple types of maltreatment is more commonly associated with morphological alterations in corticolimbic regions. These findings fit with preclinical studies showing that visual cortex is a highly plastic structure.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Akemi Tomoda"", ids = ""34902284""); list(name = ""Ann Polcari"", ids = ""2560585""); list(name = ""Carl M.

2bec4a2b8b656c7fc2b8b80285163adf3e1928fd,"Quantitative trait loci on LGs 9 and 14 affect the reproductive interaction between two Oreochromis species, O. niloticus and O. aureus","Effective farming of tilapia requires all-male culture, characterized by uniformity and high growth rate. Males of O. aureus (Oa) and females of O. niloticus (On) produce all-male offspring, but there is a behavioral reproductive barrier between the two species that prevents mass production. In crosses between Oa and On broodstocks, few hybrid females are attracted to the Oa male nests (denoted responders), and if they harbor the On alleles for the sex determination (SD) sites on linkage groups (LGs) 1, 3, and 23, all-male progeny are produced. Yet, without controlling for the alleles underlying SD, the parental stocks gradually lose their capability for all-male production. Hypothesizing that marker-assisted selection for female responders would allow production of sustainable broodstocks, we applied genotyping-by-sequencing to generate 4983 informative SNPs from 13 responding and 28 non-responding females from two full-sib families. Accounting for multiple comparisons in a genome-wide association study, seven SNPs met a false discovery rate of 0.061. Lowest nominal probabilities were on LGs 9 and 14, for which microsatellite DNA markers were designed within the candidate genes PTGDSL and CASRL, respectively. By increasing the sample size to 22 responders and 47 non-responders and by genotyping additional established microsatellites, we confirmed the association of these LGs with female responsiveness. The combined effects of microsatellites GM171 and CARSL-LOC100690618 on LGs 9 and 14 explained 37% of the phenotypic variance of reproductive interaction (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). Based on these findings, we propose a strategy for mass production of all-male tilapia hybrids through selection for genomic loci affecting SD and female responsiveness.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrey Shirak"", ids = ""5584799""); list(name = ""Tatyana Zak"", ids = ""39755322""); list(name = ""Lior Dor"", ids = ""123401519""); list(name = ""Ayana Benet-Perlberg"", ids = ""1438264013""); list(name = ""Joel Ira Weller"", ids = ""3285169""); list(name = ""Micha Ron"", ids = ""145705708""); list(name = ""Eyal Seroussi"", ids = ""2934887"")",e2e11f8f66af9bd0d403ee2f94beaf4c1bcd0d1d; d2fc728baca9075b68ea1ee245cb9a2771c53e0b,6450b0f140066c7defffeb26097baa43880e4377; 1f3a69f8762b15da1a16ba100b776c3f14950282; 0b4f3bbe9a67ea96be6518bf6e755cc525ce04d4; 9e558c557752d8680a61c7dba9f0923d1024e2b5; 741a0d7eb7b667c5850a879e3d67300d0e5d1195; 2708095e969598209dbcadaf7aeb677a656f658e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a38faadd489030b0a621a24de1dd71ae447b8539; da9c806b833b35b2f9070076381c6a02d5ece642; 2b0a63ca0b29fb5a4c55c248459342ea179f9e74; d08e448716b958facf1775251ac5792619f3376a; f54e8551b0d75adb20e6fbbbf47cd438c83ccff3; 230ffd3f3d11194a4ea95e1d268f7d525f2ad9f4; 7ff6bff6842d35f96468e6182307a3ae35025281; cebc6a79b4afd52adb5d99e0badd7cdaa1e15d1e; a6774633aa9be4d2c6a8930d26a56a61d98a6daa; 2f01bf2392a5baf154c178cdfa7297adf49970b4; 8af1fcc3fd4ed1193552b469111b3690c4ae3eca; 858d3409d582c639ac74647b16b6da638d4bb15c; d409fb998f9362acffc08b7d2b3bb310df997f94; f88eacf483a5970cd6642b484903b31b4fcd6dae; 39053b474b1a56223e346097d0c85767c7e07b19; acfdb331cd292fdce68ade097fd2eab3ffdc7374; da577086910c1b688e39ee4d2426975fe654e0d9; 1f8c4703fdeb439b2f71a5e61cc4a4aad0e37794; 29da96b446a6bdd2ae16ec9fc8714bf52bddc162; ecfbad3c6e24977a79962c4f7508798aa3b96452; dcba18ca0d0d52234b733431e4ca6e4fc53a82c6; 5d9f9a1e1eaf75ae27d198bcdac91fced1d46597; 0da9f8b424be14b3e9c58c8793a5de2c1b3187d5; 9401316328b90a048c729030f799011389d1540a; 7391f729f384cd77cf0930af9793d42ef3951676; 3bd402e54fe1e7da372f746d15ac9e28a8e14429; 231a684165f89ba1b253e82e1e7bd93525d2b12c; 81bd90360488cbe53f5c1b7ced0f0bd2b6d5ee6a; b09a7d9e09529357fb4102d67ba9f91fde1cd39f; dddc77d4928492bbd025c127206158418e2a14fd; 318fd3775ac2d9f30978751e47230318d8041afe; 73cae70862940c722f8231ecca3273b074e20500; de4c25b1db210aa28c25cddf55e7b8021c6d517d; 8254b31d65d7a5a38e65a23e407df906c23e38cb; c8b46cc59134ee67650384fa2efb7a754762e5d5; 0e68beebb4c7ccbd9d3b410b84481ae48908d029; 81f60640a805a019d9e6f3f68f20009c275b41df; 590d7f4eefe7bcb8caa2b56f7b15eb6c6786d77f; 35a781ba57a30cb50c9dda959eecffd8148e4acb; 01a949fcf7466902aa77bb145abb1c10bc18977a; 0b56dfd9e49f6ff5cd46e01ca53701217f475a60; 4848db8df14f313bcc21146e346b9eb15099e3a8; bdbf94d38284056de29330928ae247ef860045c8; 1447446cb16cbba6fed1d25753710432bac2cf80; 9de11759f7ce89f55fbc51e9d7aa6d7ee755c491; 98cff4f431054f73b4e06cfb820b915f27f54dec; adab024444ea12008a5ba32382abed27fd2f4c6d,Heredity,122,341-353
3a071021143554f205860065adee78162dc8bc6f,Non-Linear Denoising of Images using Wavelet Transform,"represent most of the Visual information efficiently. In the process of communication images are generally corrupted during coding, transmission and reception. The noise presence during image acquisition results in faulty analysis of the images. This faulty analysis leads to incorrect restoration of original image. Hence, image denoising should be perfectly performed to improve the quality of image for more precise diagnosis. Wavelet based shrinkage denoising will best restore the Visual content from noisy data. A new thresholding function for image denoising is proposed in this research paper. This proposed function is applied on the additive white Gaussian noise corrupted images using VISU, false discovery rate and translation invariant shrinkage rules.

This work aimed to characterize the gut microbial signature of patients with active psoriasis as compared with age-, body mass index- and comorbidity-matched non-psoriatic controls and to correlate them with differential expression of metabolic pathways. Fecal samples were processed and 16S rRNA was sequenced. PICRUSt was used to perform an analysis of metabolic pathways. Of the 46 participants, 52% (nÂ =Â 24) suffered from psoriasis. There was a significant difference in Î²-diversity between the two groups. Psoriatic patients had a significant increase in the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria phyla as compared with matched controls. At the genus level, psoriatic patients had a unique bacterial composition. At the species level, the psoriatic patients showed significant increases in the relative proportions of (false discovery rate, <0.05) in Ruminoccocus gnavus, Dorea formicigenerans and Collinsella aerofaciens, while Prevotella copri and Parabacteroides distasonis were significantly decreased as compared with controls. PICRUSt analysis revealed increases in metabolic pathways related to lipopolysaccharide function in the psoriatic cohort.

AM is effective in self-pollinated crops such as Dolichos bean as LD extends over longer genomic distance driven-by low rate of recombination and thereby requiring fewer markers for exploring marker-traits associations. A core set of Dolichos bean germplasm consisting of 64 accessions was evaluated for nine quantitative traits (QTs) during 2014 and 2015 rainy seasons and genotyped using 234 simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers. Substantial diversity was observed among the core set accessions at loci controlling QTs and 95 of the 234 SSR markers were found polymorphic. The structure analysis and low magnitude of fixation indices suggested weak population structure, which in-turn indicated the low possibility of false discovery rates in the marker-QTs association. The marker allele's scores were regressed onto phenotypes at nine QTs following general linear model and mixed linear model for exploring marker-QTs associations. Significantly higher number of SSR markers was found associated with genomic regions controlling nine QTs. A few of the markers such as KT Dolichos (KTD) 200 for days to 50% flowering, KTD 273 for fresh pod yield per plant and KTD 130 for fresh pods per plant explained â‰¥10% of the trait variations. The study could also identify a few SSR markers such as KTD 273, KTD 271 and KTD 130 linked to multiple traits. These linked SSR markers are suggested for validation for their use in marker-assisted Dolichos bean improvement programmes.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""P. V.

The key mathematical tools to be employed are multivariate estimation methods for probability density functions or density ratios. We compare the two algorithms with respect to their theoretical properties and with respect to their performance in practice.

9ed0d1a9ebc3ecf136d31ce2323a73a0c051a0b8,A Multi-Sample Based Method for Identifying Common CNVs in Normal Human Genomic Structure Using High-Resolution aCGH Data,"BACKGROUND
It is difficult to identify copy number variations (CNV) in normal human genomic data due to noise and non-linear relationships between different genomic regions and signal intensity. A high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) containing 42 million probes, which is very large compared to previous arrays, was recently published. Most existing CNV detection algorithms do not work well because of noise associated with the large amount of input data and because most of the current methods were not designed to analyze normal human samples. Normal human genome analysis often requires a joint approach across multiple samples. However, the majority of existing methods can only identify CNVs from a single sample.


METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
We developed a multi-sample-based genomic variations detector (MGVD) that uses segmentation to identify common breakpoints across multiple samples and a k-means-based clustering strategy. Unlike previous methods, MGVD simultaneously considers multiple samples with different genomic intensities and identifies CNVs and CNV zones (CNVZs); CNVZ is a more precise measure of the location of a genomic variant than the CNV region (CNVR).


CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE
We designed a specialized algorithm to detect common CNVs from extremely high-resolution multi-sample aCGH data. MGVD showed high sensitivity and a low false discovery rate for a simulated data set, and outperformed most current methods when real, high-resolution HapMap datasets were analyzed. MGVD also had the fastest runtime compared to the other algorithms evaluated when actual, high-resolution aCGH data were analyzed. The CNVZs identified by MGVD can be used in association studies for revealing relationships between phenotypes and genomic aberrations.

b18054acd95669c8ca344a8b0eaf47582e83f194,Inference of identity by descent in population isolates and optimal sequencing studies,"In an isolated population, individuals are likely to share large genetic regions inherited from common ancestors. Identity by descent (IBD) can be inferred from SNP genotypes, which is useful in a number of applications, including identifying genetic variants influencing complex disease risk, and planning efficient cohort-sequencing strategies. We present ANCHAP â€“ a method for detecting IBD in isolated populations. We compare accuracy of the method against other long-range and local phasing methods, using parentâ€“offspring trios. In our experiments, we show that ANCHAP performs similarly as the other long-range method, but requires an order-of-magnitude less computational resources. A local phasing model is able to achieve similar sensitivity, but only at the cost of higher false discovery rates. In some regions of the genome, the studied individuals share haplotypes particularly often, which hints at the history of the populations studied. We demonstrate the method using SNP genotypes from three isolated island populations, as well as in a cohort of unrelated individuals. In samples from three isolated populations of around 1000 individual each, an average individual shares a haplotype at a genetic locus with 9â€“12 other individuals, compared with only 1 individual within the non-isolated population. We describe an application of ANCHAP to optimally choose samples in resequencing studies. We find that with sample sizes of 1000 individuals from an isolated population genotyped using a dense SNP array, and with 20% of these individuals sequenced, 65% of sequences of the unsequenced subjects can be partially inferred.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Dominik Glodzik"", ids = ""50664961""); list(name = ""Pau Navarro"", ids = ""144218502""); list(name = ""Veronique Vitart"", ids = ""145072252""); list(name = ""Caroline Hayward"", ids = ""145458897""); list(name = ""Ruth McQuillan"", ids = ""4647193""); list(name = ""Sarah H Wild"", ids = ""145844465""); list(name = ""Malcolm G.

d816e6e566ae6a71dea05b7260ab8de70e19b46b,Cortical thickness of medial temporal gyrus and pre-central gyrus correlates with upper limb function in unilateral cerebral palsy,"Objective: Anatomical imaging studies in cerebral palsy have largely focussed on classification of white matter injury and on properties of deep grey matter. This study aims to identify any regions in the cortex where cortical grey matter thickness correlates with upper limb function as measured by the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function (MUUL). Design: Cross sectional study. Method: Nineteen subjects (aged 7y 8mos to 19y 7mos; 9 left hemiplegia; 10 right hemiplegia; GMFCS I=11, II=8) and 15 age and gender matched controls (aged 7y 6mos to 16y 2mos) were scanned with 3T Siemens MRI scanner at either the Centre for Advanced Imaging in Brisbane or the Royal Childrenâ€™s Hospital in Melbourne. Surface based morphometry of pial and grey-white cortical surfaces were used to generate cortical thickness maps across the entire cerebrum. Differences in thickness between groups (left and right hemiplegia and controls) were assessed as well as identification of regions where cortical thickness correlated with MUUL scores. Identified regions were localised using automated parcellation. Statistical significance was determined by correcting for multiple comparisons using False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 0.1. Results: There were no regions of significant difference in thickness between groups (left and right hemiplegia and controls) in either hemisphere. In subjects with right hemiplegia upper limb motor function positively correlated with cortical thickness of a region in the left middle temporal gyrus (FDR 0.1). In subjects with left hemiplegia upper limb motor function negatively correlated with a focus on the right pre-central gyrus (FDR 0.05). Conclusion: The cortical thickness of the medial temporal gyrus has been previously shown to be important for complex visuo-motor learning. This may explain the correlation between increased cortical thickness in this region and upper limb function. The region identified at the pre-central gyrus was situated at the upper limb of the motor homunculus. The inverse relationship between thickness at this region and upper limb function may suggest compensatory plastic changes in the motor cortex of impaired children.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Simon M Scheck"", ids = ""4336026""); list(name = ""Stephen E.

210a69af35d4e5ae83db797d021f0a2897e6f2d7,Global Gene Expression Profiling in Omental Adipose Tissue of Morbidly Obese Diabetic African Americans.,"BACKGROUND
Adipose tissues play important role in the pathophysiology of obesity-related diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D). To describe gene expression patterns and functional pathways in obesity-related T2D, we performed global transcript profiling of omental adipose tissue (OAT) in morbidly obese individuals with or without T2D.


METHODS
Twenty morbidly obese (mean BMI: about 54 kg/m2) subjects were studied, including 14 morbidly obese individuals with T2D (cases) and 6 morbidly obese individuals without T2D (reference group). Gene expression profiling was performed using the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 human genome expression array. Analysis of covariance was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Bioinformatics tools including PANTHER and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were applied to the DEGs to determine biological functions, networks and canonical pathways that were overrepresented in these individuals.


RESULTS
At an absolute fold-change threshold of 2 and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, 68 DEGs were identified in cases compared to the reference group. Myosin X (MYO10) and transforming growth factor beta regulator 1 (TBRG1) were upregulated. MYO10 encodes for an actin-based motor protein that has been associated with T2D. Telomere extension by telomerase (HNRNPA1, TNKS2), D-myo-inositol (1, 4, 5)-trisphosphate biosynthesis (PIP5K1A, PIP4K2A), and regulation of actin-based motility by Rho (ARPC3) were the most significant canonical pathways and overlay with T2D signaling pathway. Upstream regulator analysis predicted 5 miRNAs (miR-320b, miR-381-3p, miR-3679-3p, miR-494-3p, and miR-141-3p,) as regulators of the expression changes identified.


CONCLUSION
This study identified a number of transcripts and miRNAs in OAT as candidate novel players in the pathophysiology of T2D in African Americans.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ayo Doumatey"", ids = ""6285461""); list(name = ""Huichun Xu"", ids = ""47995779""); list(name = ""Hanxia Huang"", ids = ""3903639""); list(name = ""Niraj S.

c3616d74456e2e1112a352e786d9daf6c7823a74,Temporal phenome analysis of a large electronic health record cohort enables identification of hospital-acquired complications.,"OBJECTIVE
To develop methods for visual analysis of temporal phenotype data available through electronic health records (EHR).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
24 580 adults from the multiparameter intelligent monitoring in intensive care V.6 (MIMIC II) EHR database of critically ill patients were analyzed, with significant temporal associations visualized as a map of associations between hospital length of stay (LOS) and ICD-9-CM codes. An expanded phenotype, using ICD-9-CM, microbiology, and computerized physician order entry data, was defined for hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile (HA-CDI). LOS, estimated costs, 30-day post-discharge mortality, and antecedent medication provider order entry were evaluated for HA-CDI cases compared to randomly selected controls.


RESULTS
Temporal phenome analysis revealed 191 significant codes (p value, adjusted for false discovery rate, â‰¤0.05). HA-CDI was identified in 414 cases, and was associated with longer median LOS, 20 versus 9 days, and adjusted HR 0.33 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.39). This prolongation carries an estimated annual incremental cost increase of US$1.2-2.0 billion in the USA alone.


DISCUSSION
Comprehensive EHR data have made large-scale phenome-based analysis feasible. Time-dependent pathological disease states have dynamic phenomic evolution, which may be captured through visual analytical approaches. Although MIMIC II is a single institutional retrospective database, our approach should be portable to other EHR data sources, including prospective 'learning healthcare systems'. For example, interventions to prevent HA-CDI could be dynamically evaluated using the same techniques.


CONCLUSIONS
The new visual analytical method described in this paper led directly to the identification of numerous hospital-acquired conditions, which could be further explored through an expanded phenotype definition.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jeremy L.

ef24df7a84eaf91d2adeee32f825d44fcb60a1c9,Empirical multidimensional space for scoring peptide spectrum matches in shotgun proteomics.,"Data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is one of the main techniques for protein identification in shotgun proteomics. In a typical LC-MS/MS workflow, peptide product ion mass spectra (MS/MS spectra) are compared with those derived theoretically from a protein sequence database. Scoring of these matches results in peptide identifications. A set of peptide identifications is characterized by false discovery rate (FDR), which determines the fraction of false identifications in the set. The total number of peptides targeted for fragmentation is in the range of 10,000 to 20,000 for a several-hour LC-MS/MS run. Typically, <50% of these MS/MS spectra result in peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). A small fraction of PSMs pass the preset FDR level (commonly 1%) giving a list of identified proteins, yet a large number of correct PSMs corresponding to the peptides originally present in the sample are left behind in the ""grey area"" below the identity threshold. Following the numerous efforts to recover these correct PSMs, here we investigate the utility of a scoring scheme based on the multiple PSM descriptors available from the experimental data. These descriptors include retention time, deviation between experimental and theoretical mass, number of missed cleavages upon in-solution protein digestion, precursor ion fraction (PIF), PSM count per sequence, potential modifications, median fragment mass error, (13)C isotope mass difference, charge states, and number of PSMs per protein. The proposed scheme utilizes a set of metrics obtained for the corresponding distributions of each of the descriptors. We found that the proposed PSM scoring algorithm differentiates equally or more efficiently between correct and incorrect identifications compared with existing postsearch validation approaches.",2014,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mark V.

09859028949b931fd5b4bf6a4a8dce36a3937a2d,Gene expression Construction of null statistics in permutation-based multiple testing for multifactorial microarray experiments,"Motivation:TheparametricF-test has beenwidely used in the analysis of factorial microarray experiments to assess treatment effects. However, the normality assumption is often untenable for microarray experiments with small replications. Therefore, permutation-based methods are called for help to assess the statistical significance. The distribution of the F-statistics across all the genes on the array can be regarded as a mixture distribution with a proportion of statistics generated from thenull distributionof nodifferential geneexpressionwhereas the other proportion of statistics generated from the alternative distribution of genes differentially expressed. This results in the fact that the permutation distribution of the F-statistics may not approximate well to the truenull distributionof theF-statistics. Therefore, the constructionof a proper null statistic to better approximate the null distribution of F-statistic is of great importance to the permutation-based multiple testing in microarray data analysis. Results: In this paper,weextend the ideasof constructing null statistics based on pairwise differences to neglect the treatment effects from the two-samplecomparisonproblem to themultifactorial balancedorunbalanced microarray experiments. A null statistic based on a subpartition method is proposed and its distribution is employed to approximate the null distribution of the F-statistic. The proposed null statistic is able to accommodate unbalance in the design and is also corrected for the undue correlation between its numerator and denominator. In the simulation studies and real biological data analysis, the number of true positives and the false discovery rate (FDR)of the proposednull statistic are compared with those of the permutated version of the F-statistic. It has been shown that our proposedmethod has a better control of the FDRs and a higher power than the standard permutation method to detect differentially expressed genes because of the better approximated tail",2006,,"list(name = ""Xin Gao"", ids = ""143703146"")",,f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; 0e8622bbe6e8e92ab95bd63550cf44acdf08ab44; 9ed365e45db8bb1555a3413de2e091088ac79c67; 9393721879cae0d9becd88aa9392800ec71dd005; f731f5810b79982cdd5da5330ee98e54f9c34be4; 65c4f601132902530ff0217b21e321e9c7e7812a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e21d2ced7ea1756950e9c0258fe2e5aa7ddb596b; a380e424e71ee719ef326d38f2baee2f32752d23; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; ef920b24ce7a8f7e4c78a9835fe5fe802def5d30,,,
5927568e009a27b360b46dd3de31d1883f23ef29,HySA: a Hybrid Structural variant Assembly approach using next-generation and single-molecule sequencing technologies.,"Achieving complete, accurate, and cost-effective assembly of human genomes is of great importance for realizing the promise of precision medicine. The abundance of repeats and genetic variations in human genomes and the limitations of existing sequencing technologies call for the development of novel assembly methods that can leverage the complementary strengths of multiple technologies. We propose a Hybrid Structural variant Assembly (HySA) approach that integrates sequencing reads from next-generation sequencing and single-molecule sequencing technologies to accurately assemble and detect structural variants (SVs) in human genomes. By identifying homologous SV-containing reads from different technologies through a bipartite-graph-based clustering algorithm, our approach turns a whole genome assembly problem into a set of independent SV assembly problems, each of which can be effectively solved to enhance the assembly of structurally altered regions in human genomes. We used data generated from a haploid hydatidiform mole genome (CHM1) and a diploid human genome (NA12878) to test our approach. The result showed that, compared with existing methods, our approach had a low false discovery rate and substantially improved the detection of many types of SVs, particularly novel large insertions, small indels (10-50 bp), and short tandem repeat expansions and contractions. Our work highlights the strengths and limitations of current approaches and provides an effective solution for extending the power of existing sequencing technologies for SV discovery.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xian Ping Fan"", ids = ""49537247""); list(name = ""Mark J.

98070fc6dc4d58feb390acb5676e6c175adc2fbe,A Meta-Analysis of Gene Expression Studies in Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock,"Introduction: Sepsis represents a complex inflammatory response to infection. Gene expression studies based on microarrays have shown that this response can affect more than 80% of cellular functions and pathways, in what has been termed a â€œgenomic stormâ€. For several years, sepsis was regarded as a pro-inflammatory condition, and this concept resulted in several experimental treatment strategies aimed to block inflammation. However, systematic failure of these therapies and recent evidence demonstrating that anti-inflammatory pathways are also activated during sepsis illustrate the complexity and our incomplete knowledge about the pathogenesis of this condition. In the last decade, microarray-based gene expression studies have been used in attempts to improve our understanding about sepsis. Raw data from most of these studies are now collected in public archives, thus offering a unique opportunity to combine the information from different studies by meta-analysis. It has been shown that by analyzing data from multiple experiments, biases and artifacts between datasets can be cancelled out, potentially allowing true relationships to stand out. Accordingly, an increasing number of bioinformatics protocols and guidelines about meta-analysis of gene expression studies have been published in the last years. In the context of sepsis, several high-quality microarray-based gene expression studies are available. However, no systematic meta-analysis of these studies has been performed. In order to identify genes and pathways robustly associated with the pathogenesis of sepsis, we performed a meta-analysis of gene expression studies in human severe sepsis and septic shock. Material and methods: Microarray data were identified by searching two public databases (Gene Expression Omnibus and Array-Express) using the following search criteria: (â€œsepsis or â€œseptic shockâ€) AND (â€œperipheral bloodâ€ or â€œleukocytesâ€) AND (â€œhomo sapiensâ€). Inclusion criteria were: studies in humans with severe sepsis or septic shock; RNA obtained from peripheral blood leukocytes; availability of raw data; and matched healthy controls from the same study. To improve consistency, only studies using similar platforms were compared. We used the R/BioConductor environment to preprocess the datasets using the Robust Multi-array Average algorithm (RMA) implemented in the â€˜oligoâ€™ package and to perform meta-analysis through the â€˜RankProdâ€™ package implementation. This is a non-parametric statistical method that utilizes ranks of the log-ratio statistics for all genes across different studies to generate a list of differentially expressed (DE) genes between two conditions, and considered superior to alternative methodologies. For this study, we selected genes with fold-change of expression above 2 and false discovery rate below 0.01, calculated based on 10,000 permutations. Gene set analysis was initially performed using WebGestalt and confirmed in similar tools (KEGG, Pathway Commons, WikiPathways). Only pathways identified by more than one tool were considered. Results: Forty-five studies were identified, of which five fulfilled inclusion criteria. Our meta-analysis included data from 259 patients and 132 controls. Out of 22,216 probesets, we observed 352 as candidates for DE, 215 of which were up-regulated and 137 down-regulated. Top 5 up-regulated genes were CD177, MMP8, HP, ARG1 and ANXA3. Top 5 down-regulated genes were FCER1A, YME1L1, TRDV3, LRRN3 and MYBL1. The gene ontology term associated with the set of DE genes in both analysis with higher statistical significance was ""immune responseâ€ (adjP=2.85e-27), and the most significant pathways identified were â€œHematopoietic cell lineageâ€ (adjP=8.69e-13), â€œTCR signaling pathwayâ€ (adjP=3.04e-10) and â€œimmune systemâ€ (adjP=1.08e-19). Discussion and conclusion: The combined analysis of data generated by high-throughput experiments is an attractive and validated strategy to improve the sensitivity and specificity of genome-wide expression data. This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive list of genes, pathways and expression signatures associated with severe sepsis and septic shock, confirming several results from individual studies. In addition, our meta-analysis potentially provides new biological insights about sepsis, by listing a comprehensive list of new candidate genes with robust associations with this condition.

a6f5ca5c369c61bfff8391eab075db371f95c314,False Discovery Rate Estimation in Proteomics.,"With the advancement in proteomics separation techniques and improvements in mass analyzers, the data generated in a mass-spectrometry based proteomics experiment is rising exponentially. Such voluminous datasets necessitate automated computational tools for high-throughput data analysis and appropriate statistical control. The data is searched using one or more of the several popular database search algorithms. The matches assigned by these tools can have false positives and statistical validation of these false matches is necessary before making any biological interpretations. Without such procedures, the biological inferences do not hold true and may be outright misleading. There is a considerable overlap between true and false positives. To control the false positives amongst a set of accepted matches, there is a need for some statistical estimate that can reflect the amount of false positives present in the data processed. False discovery rate (FDR) is the metric for global confidence assessment of a large-scale proteomics dataset.

5dc846d92655438dda29796767d2900d503bbbf9,ED misdiagnosis of cerebrovascular events in the era of modern neuroimaging: A meta-analysis,"Objective: With the emergency department (ED) being a high-risk site for diagnostic errors, we sought to estimate ED diagnostic accuracy for identifying acute cerebrovascular events. Methods: MEDLINE and Embase were searched for studies (1995â€“2016) reporting ED diagnostic accuracy for ischemic stroke, TIA, or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Two independent reviewers determined inclusion. We identified 1,693 unique citations, examined 214 full articles, and analyzed 23 studies. Studies were rated on risk of bias (QUADAS-2). Diagnostic data were extracted. We prospectively defined clinical presentation subgroups to compare odds of misdiagnosis. Results: Included studies reported on 15,721 patients. Studies were at low risk of bias. Overall sensitivity (91.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 90.7â€“92.0]) and specificity (92.7% [91.7â€“93.7]) for a cerebrovascular etiology was high, but there was significant variation based on clinical presentation. Misdiagnosis was more frequent among subgroups with milder (SAH with normal vs abnormal mental state; false-negative rate 23.8% vs 4.2%, odds ratio [OR] 7.03 [4.80â€“10.31]), nonspecific (dizziness vs motor findings; false-negative rate 39.4% vs 4.4%, OR 14.22 [9.76â€“20.74]), or transient (TIA vs ischemic stroke; false discovery rate 59.7% vs 11.7%, OR 11.21 [6.66â€“18.89]) symptoms. Conclusions: Roughly 9% of cerebrovascular events are missed at initial ED presentation. Risk of misdiagnosis is much greater when presenting neurologic complaints are mild, nonspecific, or transient (range 24%â€“60%). This difference suggests that many misdiagnoses relate to symptom-specific factors. Future research should emphasize studying causes and designing error-reduction strategies in symptom-specific subgroups at greatest risk of misdiagnosis.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexander Andrea Tarnutzer"", ids = ""6887263""); list(name = ""Seung Hun Lee"", ids = ""47089709""); list(name = ""Karen A.

49cf98af08e18ecf256ce7d8d8eedded41dd5fc3,"Telomere Length, TERT, and miRNA Expression","It has been proposed that miRNAs are involved in the control of telomeres. We test that hypothesis by examining the association between miRNAs and telomere length (TL). Additionally, we evaluate if genetic variation in telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is associated with miRNA expression levels. We use data from a population-based study of colorectal cancer (CRC), where we have previously shown associations between TL and TERT and CRC, to test associations between TL and miRNA expression and TERT and miRNA expression. To gain insight into functions of miRNAs associated with TERT we tested linear associations between miRNAs and their targeted gene mRNAs. An Agilent platform that contained information on over 2000 miRNAs was used. TL was measured using a multiplexed quantitative PCR (qPCR). RNAseq was used to assess gene expression. Our sample consisted of 1152 individuals with SNP data and miRNA expression data; 363 individuals with both TL and miRNA; and 148 individuals with miRNA and mRNA data. Thirty-three miRNAs were directly associated with TL after adjusting for age and sex (false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05). TERT rs2736118 was associated with differences in miRNA expression between carcinoma and normal colonic mucosa for 75 miRNAs (FDR <0.05). Genes regulated by these miRNAs, as indicated by mRNA/miRNA associations, were associated with major signaling pathways beyond their TL-related functions, including PTEN, and PI3K/AKT signaling. Our data support a direct association between miRNAs and TL; differences in miRNA expression levels by TERT genotype were observed. Based on miRNA and targeted mRNA associations our data suggest that TERT is involved in non-TL-related functions by acting through altered miRNA expression.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Martha L.

8b14134f98f0c1b250a8da533c5e958e221a9f17,MEG Source Imaging and Group Analysis Using VBMEG,"Variational Bayesian Multimodal EncephaloGraphy (VBMEG) is a MATLAB toolbox that estimates distributed source currents from magnetoencephalography (MEG)/electroencephalography (EEG) data by integrating functional MRI (fMRI) (https://vbmeg.atr.jp/). VBMEG also estimates whole-brain connectome dynamics using anatomical connectivity derived from a diffusion MRI (dMRI). In this paper, we introduce the VBMEG toolbox and demonstrate its usefulness. By collaborating with VBMEG's tutorial page (https://vbmeg.atr.jp/docs/v2/static/vbmeg2_tutorial_neuromag.html), we show its full pipeline using an open dataset recorded by Wakeman and Henson (2015). We import the MEG data and preprocess them to estimate the source currents. From the estimated source currents, we perform a group analysis and examine the differences of current amplitudes between conditions by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), which yields results consistent with previous studies. We highlight VBMEG's characteristics by comparing these results with those obtained by other source imaging methods: weighted minimum norm estimate (wMNE), dynamic statistical parametric mapping (dSPM), and linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer. We also estimate source currents from the EEG data and the whole-brain connectome dynamics from the MEG data and dMRI.

d53d9772ae1634ac974a7b2c1d494fc211828fe1,Functional Activity and Connectivity Differences of Five Resting-State Networks in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease or Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"We aimed to investigate the activity within and the connectivity between resting state networks (RSNs) in healthy subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting-state MRI were performed on patients diagnosed with AD (n=18) or MCI (n=16) and on healthy subjects (n=18) with matching demographic characteristics (age, sex, and education level). Independent component analysis and Granger causality analysis (GCA) were used during image postprocessing. We calculated 'In + Out degree' for each RSN. Then, we investigated the relationships between ""In + Out degree"" of each brain network and the cognitive behavioural data. RSNs were obtained using the optimal matching method. The core areas of the five RSNs were similar between the AD, MCI, and healthy control groups, but the activity within these five RSNs was significantly lower in the AD and MCI groups than in the healthy control group (P<0.01, false discovery rate corrected). The GCA results showed that the connectivity between the five RSNs, particularly the connectivity from the default mode network (DMN) to the other RSNs, was slightly lower in MCI patients and was significantly lower in AD patients than in healthy subjects. In contrast, increased connectivity was evident between the memory network and the executive control network in the AD and MCI patients. The ""In + Out degree"" of the DMN negatively correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score in AD patients (R=-0.43, P<0.05). In conclusion, the activity within RSNs and the connectivity between RSNs differed between AD patients, MCI patients, and normal individuals; these results provide an imaging reference for the diagnosis of AD and the measurement of disease progression and reveal insight into the pathogenesis of AD.",2016,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yu Chen"", ids = ""50579491""); list(name = ""Hao Yan"", ids = ""152996959""); list(name = ""Zaizhu Han"", ids = ""8246794""); list(name = ""Yanchao Bi"", ids = ""2087546""); list(name = ""Hongyan Chen"", ids = ""47666412""); list(name = ""Jia Xin Liu"", ids = ""48210697""); list(name = ""Meiru Wu"", ids = ""3522164""); list(name = ""Yongjun Wang"", ids = ""39041737""); list(name = ""Yumei Zhang"", ids = ""40272677"")",e1274867d404fd1dbf73a654c217ea5c0c32852c; 1b2631f3a09b9da949adafd58995c52b2bb32617; 5cc7c0c89112dc784a7647b168b6e0605cdc7338; d37bcf7b304492f898b0493feac33a6646dea790; d838c8e50744954686041af4b569ad915b6cfc29,,Current Alzheimer research,13 3,"

b85902e1382a799b683c3907f57c896c9497f1cb,Regulation of gene expression in the mammalian eye and its relevance to eye disease.,"We used expression quantitative trait locus mapping in the laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) to gain a broad perspective of gene regulation in the mammalian eye and to identify genetic variation relevant to human eye disease. Of >31,000 gene probes represented on an Affymetrix expression microarray, 18,976 exhibited sufficient signal for reliable analysis and at least 2-fold variation in expression among 120 F(2) rats generated from an SR/JrHsd x SHRSP intercross. Genome-wide linkage analysis with 399 genetic markers revealed significant linkage with at least one marker for 1,300 probes (alpha = 0.001; estimated empirical false discovery rate = 2%). Both contiguous and noncontiguous loci were found to be important in regulating mammalian eye gene expression. We investigated one locus of each type in greater detail and identified putative transcription-altering variations in both cases. We found an inserted cREL binding sequence in the 5' flanking sequence of the Abca4 gene associated with an increased expression level of that gene, and we found a mutation of the gene encoding thyroid hormone receptor beta2 associated with a decreased expression level of the gene encoding short-wavelength sensitive opsin (Opn1sw). In addition to these positional studies, we performed a pairwise analysis of gene expression to identify genes that are regulated in a coordinated manner and used this approach to validate two previously undescribed genes involved in the human disease Bardet-Biedl syndrome. These data and analytical approaches can be used to facilitate the discovery of additional genes and regulatory elements involved in human eye disease.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Todd E.

DNa microarrays have been used to assess gene expression between groups of cells of different organs or different populations. in order to understand the role and function of the genes, one needs the complete information about their m rNa transcripts and proteins. Unfortunately, exploring the protein functions is very difficult, due to their unique 3-dimentional complicated structure. t o overcome this difficulty, one may concentrate on the mRNA molecules produced by the gene expression. in this paper, we describe some of the methods for preprocessing data for gene expression and for pairwise comparison from genomic experiments. Previous studies to assess the efficiency of different methods for pairwise comparisons have found little agreement in the lists of significant genes. Finally, we describe the procedures to control false discovery rates, sample size approach for these experiments, and available software for microarray data analysis. this paper is written for those professionals who are new in microarray data analysis for differential expression and want to have an overview of the specific steps or the different approaches for this sort of analysis.",2009,Biology,"list(name = ""gEoffREy J.

27ab6a5ad5525fb415f5dda96e8f40b7dd6991d3,Efficiency of low heritability QTL mapping under high SNP density,"The efficiency of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping methods needs to be investigated assuming high single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density and low heritability QTLs. This study assessed the efficiency of the least squares, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian approaches for QTL mapping assuming high SNP density and low heritability QTLs. We simulated 50 samples of 400 F2 individuals, which were genotyped for 1000 SNPs (average density of one SNP/centiMorgan) and phenotyped for three traits controlled by 12 QTLs and 88 minor genes. The genes were randomly distributed in the regions covered by the SNPs along ten chromosomes. The QTL heritabilities ranged from approximately 1â€“2% and the sample sizes were 200 and 400. The power of QTL detection ranged from 30 to 60%, the false discovery rate (FDR) ranged from only 0.5â€“1.2%, and the bias in the QTL position ranged from 4 to 6Â cM. The QTL mapping efficiency was not influenced by the degree of dominance. The statistical approaches were comparable regarding the FDR. Regression-based and simple interval mapping methods showed equivalent power of QTL detection and mapping precision. Compared to interval mapping, the inclusive composite interval mapping provided slightly greater QTL detection power and mapping precision only for the intermediate and high heritability QTLs. By maximizing the prior number of QTLs, the Bayesian analysis provided the greatest power of QTL detection.

95ec48f73faeb4ec9bd17aee34642c7a5c4e638c,Particulate Air Pollution Exposure and Expression of Viral and Human MicroRNAs in Blood: The Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study,"BACKGROUND
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional gene suppressors and potential mediators of environmental effects. In addition to human miRNAs, viral miRNAs expressed from latent viral sequences are detectable in human cells.


OBJECTIVE
In a highly exposed population in Beijing, China, we evaluated the associations of particulate air pollution exposure on blood miRNA profiles.


METHODS
The Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study (BTDAS) included 60 truck drivers and 60 office workers. We investigated associations of short-term air pollution exposure, using measures of personal PM2.5 (particulate matter â‰¤ 2.5 Î¼m) and elemental carbon (EC), and ambient PM10 (â‰¤ 10 Î¼m), with blood NanoString nCounter miRNA profiles at two exams separated by 1-2 weeks.


RESULTS
No miRNA was significantly associated with personal PM2.5 at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 20%. Short-term ambient PM10 was associated with the expression of 12 miRNAs in office workers only (FDR < 20%). Short-term EC was associated with differential expression of 46 human and 7 viral miRNAs, the latter including 3 and 4 viral miRNAs in office workers and truck drivers, respectively. EC-associated miRNAs differed between office workers and truck drivers with significant effect modification by occupational group. Functional interaction network analysis suggested enriched cellular proliferation/differentiation pathways in truck drivers and proinflammation pathways in office workers.


CONCLUSIONS
Short-term EC exposure was associated with the expression of human and viral miRNAs that may influence immune responses and other biological pathways. Associations between EC exposure and viral miRNA expression suggest that latent viral miRNAs are potential mediators of air pollution-associated health effects. PM2.5/PM10 exposures showed no consistent relationships with miRNA expression.",2016,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Lifang Hou"", ids = ""144021428""); list(name = ""Jitendra Barupal"", ids = ""4254016""); list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""49039959""); list(name = ""Yinan Zheng"", ids = ""2112470""); list(name = ""Lei Liu"", ids = ""47967949""); list(name = ""Xiao Zhang"", ids = ""2358097""); list(name = ""Chang Dou"", ids = ""38986953""); list(name = ""John P McCracken"", ids = ""34880965""); list(name = ""AnaitÃ© DÃ­az"", ids = ""66316772""); list(name = ""Valeria Motta"", ids = ""39404638""); list(name = ""Marco SÃ¡nchez-Guerra"", ids = ""3876588""); list(name = ""Katherine Rose Wolf"", ids = ""27026528""); list(name = ""Pier A Bertazzi"", ids = ""3907319""); list(name = ""Joel Schwartz"", ids = ""1972998""); list(name = ""Sheng Wang"", ids = ""49184066""); list(name = ""Andrea A.

Quantitative proteome profiling of Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 (SD1) in vitro (derived from LB cell cultures) and in vivo (derived from gnotobiotic piglets) was performed by 2D-LC-MS/MS and APEX, a label-free computationally modified spectral counting methodology.ResultsOverall, 1761 proteins were quantitated at a 5% FDR (false discovery rate), including 1480 and 1505 from in vitro and in vivo samples, respectively. Identification of 350 cytoplasmic membrane and outer membrane (OM) proteins (38% of in silico predicted SD1 membrane proteome) contributed to the most extensive survey of the Shigella membrane proteome reported so far. Differential protein abundance analysis using statistical tests revealed that SD1 cells switched to an anaerobic energy metabolism under in vivo conditions, resulting in an increase in fermentative, propanoate, butanoate and nitrate metabolism. Abundance increases of transcription activators FNR and Nar supported the notion of a switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration in the host gut environment. High in vivo abundances of proteins involved in acid resistance (GadB, AdiA) and mixed acid fermentation (PflA/PflB) indicated bacterial survival responses to acid stress, while increased abundance of oxidative stress proteins (YfiD/YfiF/SodB) implied that defense mechanisms against oxygen radicals were mobilized. Proteins involved in peptidoglycan turnover (MurB) were increased, while Î²-barrel OM proteins (OmpA), OM lipoproteins (NlpD), chaperones involved in OM protein folding pathways (YraP, NlpB) and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (Imp) were decreased, suggesting unexpected modulations of the outer membrane/peptidoglycan layers in vivo. Several virulence proteins of the Mxi-Spa type III secretion system and invasion plasmid antigens (Ipa proteins) required for invasion of colonic epithelial cells, and release of bacteria into the host cell cytosol were increased in vivo.ConclusionsGlobal proteomic profiling of SD1 comparing in vivo vs. in vitro proteomes revealed differential expression of proteins geared towards survival of the pathogen in the host gut environment, including increased abundance of proteins involved in anaerobic energy respiration, acid resistance and virulence.

To identify genes with a role in PE, we conducted a large-scale association study evaluating 775 SNPs in 190 candidate genes selected for a potential role in obstetrical complications. SNP discovery was performed by DNA sequencing, and genotyping was carried out in a high-throughput facility using the MassARRAYTM System. Women with PE (n = 394) and their offspring (n = 324) were compared with control women (n = 602) and their offspring (n = 631) from the same hospital-based population. Haplotypes were estimated for each gene using the EM algorithm, and empirical p values were obtained for a logistic regression-based score test, adjusted for significant covariates. An interaction model between maternal and offspring genotypes was also evaluated. The most significant findings for association with PE were COL1A1 (p = 0.0011) and IL1A (p = 0.0014) for the maternal genotype, and PLAUR (p = 0.0008) for the offspring genotype. Common candidate genes for PE, including MTHFR and NOS3, were not significantly associated with PE. For the interaction model, SNPs within IGF1 (p = 0.0035) and IL4R (p = 0.0036) gave the most significant results. This study is one of the most comprehensive genetic association studies of PE to date, including an evaluation of offspring genotypes that have rarely been considered in previous studies. Although we did not identify statistically significant evidence of association for any of the candidate loci evaluated here after adjusting for multiple testing using the false discovery rate, additional compelling evidence exists, including multiple SNPs with nominally significant p values in COL1A1 and the IL1A region, and previous reports of association for IL1A, to support continued interest in these genes as candidates for PE. Identification of the genetic regulators of PE may have broader implications, since women with PE are at increased risk of death from cardiovascular diseases later in life.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Katrina A B Goddard"", ids = ""36538818""); list(name = ""Gerard Tromp"", ids = ""145582217""); list(name = ""Roberto L.

Several malignancies are known to exhibit a ""field effect,"" whereby regions beyond tumor boundaries harbor histologic or molecular changes that are associated with cancer. We sought to determine if histologically benign prostate epithelium collected from men with prostate cancer exhibits features indicative of premalignancy or field effect.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Prostate needle biopsies from 15 men with high-grade (Gleason 8-10) prostate cancer and 15 age- and body mass index-matched controls were identified from a biospecimen repository. Benign epithelia from each patient were isolated by laser capture microdissection. RNA was isolated, amplified, and used for microarray hybridization. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the expression of specific genes of interest. Alterations in protein expression were analyzed through immunohistochemistry.


RESULTS
Overall patterns of gene expression in microdissected benign prostate-associated benign epithelium (BABE) and cancer-associated benign epithelium (CABE) were similar. Two genes previously associated with prostate cancer, PSMA and SSTR1, were significantly upregulated in the CABE group (false discovery rate <1%). Expression of other prostate cancer-associated genes, including ERG, HOXC4, HOXC5, and MME, were also increased in CABE by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, although other genes commonly altered in prostate cancer were not different between the BABE and CABE samples. The expression of MME and PSMA proteins on immunohistochemistry coincided with their mRNA alterations.


CONCLUSION
Gene expression profiles between benign epithelia of patients with and without prostate cancer are very similar. However, these tissues exhibit differences in the expression levels of several genes previously associated with prostate cancer development or progression. These differences may comprise a field effect and represent early events in carcinogenesis.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Michael C. Risk"", ids = ""40368632""); list(name = ""Beatrice S.

a1379882981e14a86d5a49925bb38dfd49f817c8,On Least Favorable Configurations for Step-up-down Tests,"This paper investigates an open issue related to false discovery rate (FDR) control of step-up-down (SUD) multiple testing procedures. It has been established in earlier literature that for this type of procedure, under some broad conditions, and in an asymptotical sense, the FDR is maximum when the signal strength under the alternative is maximum. In other words, so-called \Dirac uniform congura- tions"" are asymptotically least favorable in this setting. It is known that this prop- erty also holds in a non-asymptotical sense (for any nite number of hypotheses), for the two extreme versions of SUD procedures, namely step-up and step-down (with extra conditions for the step-down case). It is therefore very natural to con- jecture that this non-asymptotical least favorable conguration property could more generally be true for all \intermediate"" forms of SUD procedures. We prove that this is, somewhat surprisingly, not the case. The argument is based on the exact calculations proposed earlier by Roquain and Villers (2011), that we extend here by generalizing Steck's recursion to the case of two populations. Secondly, we quantify the magnitude of this phenomenon by providing a nonasymptotic upper-bound and explicit vanishing rates as a function of the total number of hypotheses.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Gilles Blanchard"", ids = ""145945278""); list(name = ""Thorsten Dickhaus"", ids = ""46649155""); list(name = ""Etienne Roquain"", ids = ""3117456""); list(name = ""Fanny Villers"", ids = ""47178163"")",a1379882981e14a86d5a49925bb38dfd49f817c8; 4c41f150652eb93effac5d98c483914eddea51e0; 451c2b09f99f7f99046863e8df49627776838e54; 0ac8035938e2077d300b5ca64f7303df2d2e54fd; 56216701b418ff8b69026286c47b7cd5f4ebdf89; 47d1f32aa0e760d570fdd57a95280f0618f1003a; 85b3043be9fa0b7afe0e72694a23df8dfcbcb0a1; 86f7e3884dc7c5921ead7c9531851595bdc98cd0; e6fbec5d97a9b9ec3b04f72079387352752cbab5; bc7a85db397394ef6899ddeaa0eaa7a4eb0e6ebb; b1a2c9e94f92006d9df6874e5dc26669dcde4930; 4757f6e2038748d6b4f11e21bc96eae6e6b417eb; ab50d8661b6575502b87582d157987fb4de83ba0,e91ae2cef456516df3d9fc6997428500a1b8b5d3; a1379882981e14a86d5a49925bb38dfd49f817c8,Statistica Sinica,24,1-23
48be9ab1d8bd5a5a1ad03cd520dbceb3e7f0c1f4,Plasma interleukin-6 correlates with connectivity of the default mode network in midlife adults,"The default mode network (DMN) is a group of brain systems that exhibit correlated activity at rest. Functional variation within the DMN is implicated in social, cognitive, and affective processes, as well as psychiatric and neurological disorders that associate with systemic inflammation. A major DMN hub, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), connects with autonomic and neuroendocrine mechanisms that proximally influence inflammation. We tested whether plasma interleukin (IL)-6 covaried with functional DMN connectivity among 98 adults aged 30â€“54 (39% male; 81% Caucasian). DMN connectivity maps were derived using independent component analyses (MELODIC; ( http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/MELODIC )). Voxel-wise linear regression analyses tested IL-6 and DMN associations controlling for age, sex, and BMI at a whole-brain corrected false discovery rate threshold of q Â =Â 0.05 with an extent threshold of 20 voxels. Within the vmPFC, IL-6 covaried positively with connectivity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and negatively with a portion of Brodmann area 11; while subcortically, IL-6 covaried negatively with connectivity of the medial thalamus and dorsal pons (all t â€™s >3.4). It is possible that (1) higher peripheral inflammation through afferent visceral pathways influences connectivity within vmPFC and subcortical regions or (2) vmPFC connectivity, potentially via subcortical pathways, modulates peripheral autonomic and neuroendocrine mechanisms that upregulate inflammation. A link between DMN and peripheral inflammation provides a novel brain-body pathway that may be relevant to understanding depression and dementia.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Anna L.

af49aa2847283a68701b10cfc4412deeb6e12480,Characterisation of the nasal microbiota in granulomatosis with polyangiitis,"Objectives Prior studies have suggested a potential link between nasal microbes and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; Wegenerâ€™s), but these studies relied on culture-dependent methods. This study comprehensively examined the entire community of nasal microbiota (bacteria and fungi) in participants with GPA compared with healthy controls using deep sequencing methods. Methods 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer gene sequencing were performed on nasal microbial DNA isolated from nasal swabs of 60 participants with GPA and 41 healthy controls. Alpha and beta diversity were assessed as well as the relative abundance of the most abundant bacterial and fungal taxa. The effects of covariates including disease activity and immunosuppressive therapies on microbial composition were evaluated. Results Compared with controls, participants with GPA had a significantly different microbial composition (weighted UniFrac p=0.04) and lower relative abundance of Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis (for both, false discovery rate-corrected p=0.02). Disease activity in GPA was associated with a lower abundance of fungal order Malasseziales compared with participants with GPA in remission (p=0.04) and controls (p=0.01). Use of non-glucocorticoid immunosuppressive therapy was associated with â€˜healthyâ€™ nasal microbiota while participants with GPA who were off immunosuppressive therapy had more dysbiosis (weighted UniFrac p=0.01). No difference in the relative abundance of Staphylococcus aureus was observed between GPA and controls. Conclusions GPA is associated with an altered nasal microbial composition, at both the bacterial and fungal levels. Use of immunosuppressive therapies and disease remission are associated with healthy microbial communities.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rennie L Rhee"", ids = ""14031856""); list(name = ""Antoine G.

59df38f1c9c6e1b387274f0753721f1b0114ee5b,Abstract 2188: Genetic variation in angiogenesis-related genes is associated with colorectal cancer risk and prognosis,"Introduction Angiogenesis, the generation of new blood vessels, is crucial in tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. The process involves a variety of factors including signaling, adhesion and chemotactic molecules, ECM (extracellular matrix) proteins, proteinases, transcription factors, growth factors and receptors. Variation in genes encoding these factors potentially influence angiogenic processes. We thus evaluated the association between variants in angiogenesis-related genes and risk as well as prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Approach In a candidate pathway approach, we investigated 437 variants in 36 angiogenesis-related genes for association with CRC risk and prognosis in âˆ¼1800 patients and âˆ¼1800 controls of the German DACHS/IMPACT study. Patients were aged 30 years or older and diagnosed between 2003 and 2007. CRC risk was estimated using conditional logistic regression based on the co-dominant inheritance model. In addition, we investigated the association between polymorphisms and overall survival using multivariable Cox regression. Correction for multiple testing was performed using false discovery rates (FDR). Results Risk Several of the investigated variants in ANGTP1, ETS1, FLT4, MMP2, NOTCH4, PDGFRB, TGFB2 were associated with risk of CRC, and one variant in DLL1 (delta-like 1) remained significant after accounting for multiple testing. DLL1 rs9348307 was associated with decreased risk of CRC (ORGC 0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.96; ORCC 0.62, 95% CI 0.36-1.06, p=0.02). Survival After a median follow up time of 5 years, variants in twelve genes (ANGPT1, EFNB2, ETS1, FLT4, JAG1, KDR, MMP2, MMP9, NRP1, NRP2, PDGFRB, TGFB2) were associated with overall survival in CRC patients. When accounting for multiple testing, variants in EFNB2, JAG1 and MMP2 remained significant. Most of the EFNB2 variants were associated with poorer survival, while one variant in EFNB2 was associated with better survival (rs2391333: HRCT 0.88, 95% CI 0.74-1.05; HRTT 0.60, 95% CI 0.45-0.78, p Conclusion Variants in angiogenesis-related genes were associated with CRC risk and overall survival in CRC patients. Two of the identified genes (DLL1 and JAG1) are involved in NOTCH signaling, which is crucial to cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis, underlining the importance of this oncogenic pathway in colorectal carcinogenesis.

98cf53950d86bcbce5d7402756d0fca8cb42f0b7,Hawley H. Seiler Resident Award. Transcriptional profile of brain injury in hypothermic circulatory arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass.,"BACKGROUND
Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of neurologic complications after hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Canine genome sequencing allows profiling of genomic changes after HCA and CPB alone. We hypothesize that gene regulation will increase with increased severity of injury.


METHODS
Dogs underwent 2-hour HCA at 18 degrees C (n = 10), 1-hour HCA (n = 8), or 2-hour CPB at 32 degrees C alone (n = 8). In each group, half were sacrificed at 8 hours and half at 24 hours after treatment. After neurologic scoring, brains were harvested for genomic analysis. Hippocampal RNA isolates were analyzed using canine oligonucleotide expression arrays containing 42,028 probes.


RESULTS
Consistent with prior work, dogs that underwent 2-hour HCA experienced severe neurologic injury. One hour of HCA caused intermediate clinical damage. Cardiopulmonary bypass alone yielded normal clinical scores. Cardiopulmonary bypass, 1-hour HCA, and 2-hour HCA groups historically demonstrated increasing degrees of histopathologic damage (previously published). Exploratory analysis revealed differences in significantly regulated genes (false discovery rate < 10%, absolute fold change > or = 1.2), with increases in differential gene expression with injury severity. At 8 hours and 24 hours after insult, 2-hour HCA dogs had 502 and 1,057 genes regulated, respectively; 1-hour HCA dogs had 179 and 56 genes regulated; and CPB alone dogs had 5 and 0 genes regulated.


CONCLUSIONS
Our genomic profile of canine brains after HCA and CPB revealed 1-hour and 2-hour HCA induced markedly increased gene regulation, in contrast to the minimal effect of CPB alone. This adds to the body of neurologic literature supporting the safety of CPB alone and the minimal effect of CPB on a normal brain, while illuminating genomic results of both.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jeremiah G.

c4c2da30a78b10459249d8eaf946aa3722324f07,Transcriptome and physiological analysis of a lutein-producing alga Desmodesmus sp. reveals the molecular mechanisms for high lutein productivity,"Abstract A green alga Desmodesmus sp. JSC3 is a lutein producer that appears high in lutein production in batch culture under 200Â Î¼molÂ·m âˆ’Â 2 Â·s âˆ’Â 1 condition using 1Â gÂ âˆ™Â L âˆ’Â 1 sodium nitrate as nitrogen source. Because lutein content increased as growth advanced with the maximum (5.18Â mgÂ âˆ™Â g âˆ’Â 1 ) on day 6, comparative transcriptome and physiological analyses on day 1, 6, and 8 were thus employed to uncover the molecular mechanisms for lutein production in this lutein producer. The gene set enrichment analysis using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) test showed that chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis were significantly changed when lutein accumulated. The up-regulation of the carotenogenesis genes explains the preference of this alga in lutein accumulation by enhancing lycopene synthesis and promoting metabolic flux towards synthesis of Î±-carotene and then hydroxylation of the Î²- and e-ring of Î±-carotene, in the late exponential growth period (4â€“6Â days). Chlorophyll content and the expression of the genes encoding the enzymes in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis also increased during 0â€“6Â days, although chlorophyll a /chlorophyll b ratio decreased on day 6 due to light attenuation caused by high cell density. Photosynthetic activity and the expression of the genes encoding light-harvesting complex (LHC) proteins increased during 0â€“4Â days but decreased after that due to nitrogen deficiency (up-regulation of high-affinity nitrate transporter gene and low medium nitrate concentration). It suggests that LHC synthesis and photosynthesis are sensitive to nitrogen deficiency occurring on day 6 while pigment synthesis remains active. Because the expression of the genes encoding LHC-like proteins (early light-inducible proteins) that bind lutein and chlorophyll increased on day 6, LHC-like proteins could be temporarily stores of accumulating pigments. In conclusion, coordinate up-regulation of LHC-like proteins with pigment synthesis for the acclimation to decreasing light availability is believed as the molecular mechanism for high lutein production in Desmodesmus sp.

Stringent conditions were employed to reduce the false discovery rate. A total of 25 wheat unigenes were found to express differentially in response to F. graminearum infection. Genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins such as beta-1,3-glucanase (PR-2), wheatwins (PR-4), and thaumatin-like proteins (PR-5) showed a significant upregulation in genotypes having the Sumai-3 3BS region. For these three genes, the gene activity was significantly less in the genotype (NIL-3) lacking the Sumai-3 3BS segment. Significant upregulation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase was detected only in the resistant Sumai-3, indicating the importance of both the 2AL and 3BS regions in the activation of effective defense responses to infection by F. graminearum. Differences in gene expression between the resistant Sumai-3 and the susceptible NILs were found to be mainly quantitative in nature.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Saber Golkari"", ids = ""12322285""); list(name = ""Jeannie Gilbert"", ids = ""34310073""); list(name = ""Tomohiro Ban"", ids = ""37379306""); list(name = ""J.

70efa4f3d1cfa73d21b9ebf5b1a579f0502f9c9d,Identification of novel DNA-methylated genes that correlate with human prostate cancer and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) harbors a myriad of genomic and epigenetic defects. Cytosine methylation of CpG-rich promoter DNA is an important mechanism of epigenetic gene inactivation in PCa. There is considerable amount of data to suggest that DNA methylation-based biomarkers may be useful for the early detection and diagnosis of PCa. In addition, candidate genebased studies have shown an association between specific gene methylation and alterations and clinicopathologic indicators of poor prognosis in PCa. METHODS: To more comprehensively identify DNA methylation alterations in PCa initiation and progression, we examined the methylation status of 485 577 CpG sites from regions with a broad spectrum of CpG densities, interrogating both gene-associated and non-associated regions using the recently developed Illumina 450K methylation platform. RESULTS: In all, we selected 33 promoter-associated novel CpG sites that were differentially methylated in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and PCa in comparison with benign prostate tissue samples (false discovery rate-adjusted P-value o0.05; b-value X0.2; fold change 41.5). Of the 33 genes, hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated BNC1, FZD1, RPL39L, SYN2, LMX1B, CXXC5, ZNF783 and CYB5R2 as top candidate novel genes that are frequently methylated and whose methylation was associated with inactivation of gene expression in PCa cell lines. Pathway analysis of the genes with altered methylation patterns identified the involvement of a cancer-related network of genes whose activity may be regulated by TP53, MYC, TNF, IL1 and 6, IFN-g and FOS in prostate pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our genome-wide methylation profile shows epigenetic dysregulation of important regulatory signals in prostate carcinogenesis.",2014,,"list(name = ""Joseph M.

7afe3d7adc7e7df2351bdbf214bcae77721955b0,Macrostructural abnormalities in Korsakoff syndrome compared with uncomplicated alcoholism,"Objective: To distinguish, in patients with Korsakoff syndrome (KS), the structural brain abnormalities shared with alcoholic patients without KS (AL), from those specific to KS. Methods: MRI data were collected in 11 alcoholic patients with KS, 34 alcoholic patients without KS, and 25 healthy control subjects (CS). Gray and white matter volumes were compared in the 3 groups using a voxel-based approach. Results: A conjunction analysis indicated a large pattern of shared gray and white matter volume deficits in AL and KS. There were graded effects of volume deficits (KS < AL < CS) in the medial portion of the thalami, hypothalamus (mammillary bodies), left insula, and genu of the corpus callosum. Abnormalities in the left thalamic radiation were observed only in KS. Conclusions: Our results indicate considerable similarities in the pattern of gray and white matter damage in AL and KS. This finding confirms the widespread neurotoxic effect of chronic alcohol consumption. Only a few cerebral regions, including the medial thalami, mammillary bodies, and corpus callosum, were more severely damaged in KS than in AL. The continuum of macrostructural damage from AL to KS is therefore restricted to key brain structures. Longitudinal investigations are required to determine whether alcoholic patients with medial thalamic volumes that are comparable to those of patients with KS are at increased risk of developing KS.

7678e9148c82916a2f7e06f7c70df758ed15a7e3,Integration of functional and structural connectivity from rs-fMRI and DTI to study healthy maltreated adolescents,"Target Audience: The psychiatrists, psychologists, neurologists and MR physicists who wish to use advanced MR techniques to detect subtle functional and structural connectivity abnormality in psychiatrically high-risk group such as maltreated adolescents. Introduction and Purpose: Childhood maltreatment (MALTX), including emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse and neglect, is widespread in the United States. MALTX has been known to produce long-lasting impairments in behavioral, cognitive and social functioning, but their underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Integrating functional and structural connectivity from resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides insight of the affected brain circuits including both cortical region and white matter tracts in the maltreated subjects. Recent DTI investigation (1-2) suggests white matter abnormality of maltreated young adults and adolescents. However, to our knowledge, there have been no reports investigating the maltreated group with integrated functional and structural connectivity measures. In this study, 19 MALTX adolescent volunteers and 13 age-matched control volunteers were recruited and underwent both rs-fMRI and DTI scanning. The rs-fMRI and DTI datasets were analyzed to identify the disrupted functional and structural connectivity, respectively. Our aim was to identify the disrupted structural and functional connectivity and reveal the relationship of the abnormal connectivity of both types in the maltreated healthy subjects. The abnormality of the structural and functional connectivity preceding the onset of psychopathology may serve as potential biomarkers of psychiatric disorders such as depression and substance abuse. Methods Participants: 19 adolescent volunteers (age=15.9Â±2.8) with no personal history of a psychiatric illness, but experienced MALTX prior to age 10 years, and 13 adolescent volunteers (age=16.4Â±3.9) with no personal or family history of a psychiatric disorder or trauma history were recruited. All participants were between 12-20 years, and Tanner Stage III, IV or V of pubertal development. All 32 subjects were scanned with DTI and 19 subjects (9 maltreated and 10 controls) were scanned with rs-fMRI. rs-fMRI and DTI acquisition: A 3T Philips Achieva MR system was used. DTI data were acquired using a single-shot EPI with SENSE. DTI parameters: imaging resolution=2x2x2.2 mm, slice number=65, independent diffusion-weighted directions=30, b-value = 1000 sec/mm, repetitions=2. Co-registered rs-fMRI was acquired with a single-shot gradient EPI T2*-weighted sequence with time series of 240 EPI volumes. Imaging resolution of rs-fMRI is 3.4x3.4x4mm. rs-fMRI data analysis: rs-fMRI was processed with AFNI (3). After pre-processing, signals were low-pass filtered with 0.1 Hz cutoff frequency. Seed region of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) was centered at (-10, -54, 14) and (8, -54, 14) in Talairach space. The average seed region time course in the filtered data was correlated with all other pixels to form functional connectivity maps for each subject. DTI data analysis: TBSS (4) was used for voxel-wise comparison of fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. Different from standard TBSS, the single subject template used for nonlinear registration process in TBSS is identical to the template used for establishing JHU ICBM-DTI-81 (5). Integrated rs-fMRI and DTI analysis: The voxels with significant functional connectivity differences were used as region of interest (ROI) to initiate DTI-based tractography The traced white matter tracts were identified with the reference (6). Clinical correlation: The mean PCC-PFC correlation values and FA values at disrupted clusters were extracted to be correlated with clinical scores. Results Functional connectivity: Fig. 1 shows the functional connectivity within left superior prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the default network for the control and maltreated groups, respectively. Using the threshold of p=0.05 after false discovery rate (FDR) correction, the positive connectivity in both groups was significant between PCC and the PFC. Associated structural connectivity: As shown from Fig. 2, part of left superior longitudinal fasciculi (SLF-L), left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO-L) and genu of the corpus callosum (GCC) were traced from the voxels where maltreated subjects had less functional connectivity (cluster at cross-hair in Fig. 1). Concurrently, significant white matter disruptions in SLF-L and IFO-L have been found with TBSS analysis of FA measurements in maltreated group, indicating the relationship of the disrupted functional connectivity and disrupted structural connectivity. The averaged FA of the two groups in these tracts and correlation coefficient at PFC of the two groups are listed in Table 1. Between the two groups, significant FA differences (p<0.05) can be found in SLF-L and IFO-L while significant correlation coefficient difference (p<0.05) can be found in PFC. Clinical correlation: After controlling for age, sex and socioeconomic status, early life adversity correlated negatively with SLF-L (r24=-0.63, p<0.001) and IFO-L (r24=-0.6, p<0.001). Maltreated group had a negative correlation between PFC-PCC connectivity with clinician-rated depressive symptoms (CDRS: r = -0.77; p=0.06). Data from normal controls did not show any significant correlations. Fig. 1 (upper left): Functional PCC-PFC connectivity map for control and maltreated group. The underlying brain images are average of all subjects in Talairach space. The cross-hair indicates the voxels in left PFC with significant functional connectivity difference. Fig. 2 (upper right): 3D reconstruction of white matter fibers (red) traced from the rs-fMRI cluster (yellow) at PFC. The red fibers are part of SLF-L, IFO-L and GCC, as indicated by black labels. Yellow cluster is reconstructed from the voxels with significant functional connectivity difference in Fig. 1.

Association of structural and functional connectivity has been investigated in multiple reports (e.g. 4-5) by integrating DTI and rs-fMRI in normal subjects. By using the disrupted functional connectivity voxels from AFNI as region of interest (ROI) to initiate fiber tracking, the traced white matter tracts were identified to be consistent to the tracts which have clusters with microstructural abnormality from TBSS analysis. This may be the first study to reveal the consistent structural and functional connectivity abnormality in maltreated group. Both structural and functional connectivity measures showed correlation with clinical scores, suggesting that abnormal structural and functional connectivity measures might serve as potential biomarkers of vulnerability to psychopathology in maltreated subjects. A larger sample size will be needed for statistical power. References: [1] Choi et al (2009) Biol Psychiatry 65, 227. [2] Huang et al (2012) Neuropsychopharmacology 37, 2693.

04fce329cc28993c80a7236c62c153d883af27b3,Multiple testing problems in pharmaceutical statistics,"This book gives an overview of the present multiple hypothesis testing that goes on in the pharmaceutical field. There are many good reviews of multiple hypothesis testing in general, such as [2], but little that is solely devoted to the pharmaceutical field. The book presents the subject matter in a way that is very thorough and is written by some of the top researchers in the field. First it goes into the multiplicity problems that one commonly experiences in controlled trials. In particular, it highlights the difficulties in trials such as those with multiple subgroups. It then addresses the multiple hypothesis problem through the use of the conventional p-value approach as well as the parametric and resampling approaches. Analysis of multiple endpoints is illustrated through the use of tests such as the union-intersection procedure which is used in determining if the treatment is superior on all end points. Gatekeeping procedures and adaptive designs which are commonplace in the pharmaceutical field are also covered. The book ends with the use of drug efficacy via the use of microarray experiments. While SAS code has been provided, R code has not. I do not view this as a deficiency since the target audience for this book is not researchers but rather practising statisticians in the pharmaceutical field. A little more work could have gone into describing multiple hypothesis testing in the context of microarrays. The importance and relevance of the false discovery rate [1] in studies today should have been highlighted a little more. Overall the book is a good one and libraries should be encouraged to purchase a copy. It will be useful to those researchers in both the biomedical and statistics fields. Practising statisticians in industry stand to benefit most from the book because of its completeness.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Isaac Dialsingh"", ids = ""2931072"")",b683a603f61b55fef4877cbeb5780c0434483101; ef841f1c9b47fabfb3bd5ff67f3684ef717e2f26; c7130fbd8e8e2ba25144f0a66c458cae1269abbf; 65802b3050b59596b2557511628b179de6a8007b; 28d4befd477934d3ba65a5c2bfa5cb68d477eca3; 9ccd7898a071185444d6ae22f1ec65a405c5413c; f22120a0eccc18fe07710981ef6c7027d5f52211; cb3a95c89f5855049d79fa8ccf2da70166df68b8; 30df458f387ee72c4dbd52d40ebe69056eba3acd; de8311837c4df9fc0ee2be8ae66f97d86007ce73; 89c342f3083179f5410c0969a197baabf940feeb; e031d84167a586d43871578f809b869f958f3dbb; 7e5d1162dd526fb4e39d579690540b59df75b7cc; ff50d364bf95b008cf98c2bf1134c08f808ed777; 4c19a4a465bdf06240e62e8147229158db860e4f; 9ddc221865f1dd90ab38ab633228eb6d2703679b; 3b89b4d55f63149b43f4308f947c71f7ce9cd1f7; f44c2ebb42bfc9b2321c2a852dfa415b2d07020b; d791a2387ccfc67f7a2447214685f3b954c16b38; 31c4d1873452ef4a5a02934f2292bbd3c223c62e; 4be3c5d38e883832482129bdfb8dc87e796d7b8c; 9863972c9fc121d2e0d23fdb00a5feedd1f6b923; 5534a4955031c8b3110d098c02e037f3a9bd26b7; e435b7134f2822eca3754f933f88ca1e96458417; 02abd007461cf470fe9e2aa7923a8575baa49e7d; 1bcc546caeafc0e62f7ee74085f4dca3c2b1df59; 0725893c81e1ea0131e27ffab61c31900f9bef05; 1a51317c13229a62990edb04da475be11a4d176f; c645a9829169b1588a45904cfd7a239cd5588f02; 77a7fb4d889590f5a7ae102d1e04ea5cef62889e; e4a3951ddeb6ff884be75b2e5511ad1ee693fd40; 733fba35aae9f848da9235afcb77953c1571cce2; acecba4c99aa13547556d893a181311b21a1f479; 62836835f313f4a178d5653eb4ec9fef37098380; 6149d1ad0da48a6db4931cd0fd1004c71271eaf7; a9538dc90a189bb590a3191b2064f7d5a47ee085; ec518f775f47b5d15e33b6c20fd0b652b5981c89; d59f5489324bacdf7bc2ae728443ea7181d73faa; 1d9f0e7ff06769af0cb942b897f3284bc93ae7fd; 1ea8adee2278e2356063ef117d705493c1cfea66; b620b6e2b431b5a494c5f27326c8e81c7787b7d8; be2b6916534d806f3b49a79cd150b53bce678bac; 01668517e9c86a953d75824af8d5d9cf95c5b20d; 320049b920a037434c8bb5af25a6b276fd914561; ae041a3569dbc7552f33b63426fb77e859f85e85; 8c89115ab43899171afc67c1ac0f7bd19bef0961; fc8d8a623db6b51922c6cd61d882e6e2861461be; dcdb37ebbe947dd421f169c0b23354a0e5a58708,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e,Journal of Applied Statistics,38,2987 - 2987

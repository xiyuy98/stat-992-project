4e8b8cc3839e12b94618ffc78d30076f618ed296,Quantitative Trait Loci Analysis in Animals,"Most traits of economic importance in livestock and of medical importance in man are quantitative in nature, and hence the ability to unravel the genetics of quantitative traits is of major importance. Before the arrival of genetic markers, animal breeders had developed very effective tools to analyse quantitative trait variation. This knowledge was very effectively exploited through the prediction and selection of animals with high breeding values using statistical tools and information obtained from phenotypes and the pedigree alone and this had led to great improvements in the efficiency of livestock production. So effective were the tools developed by animal breeders that many questioned the value of dissecting and exploiting the individual quantitative trait loci (QTL) using marker information. However, traits such as disease resistance and meat quality can be difficult to improve by the traditional methods and direct genomic selection could add significantly to genetic progress for such traits. Thus over the last 10 years there has thus been a rapid growth of studies designed to map and ultimately identify genes underlying quantitative variation in animals. Joel Weller has been at the forefront of developing methods for QTL analysis in livestock (as well as making significant contributions in other areas of livestock genetics). Thus it is welcome to see his textbook on the analysis of QTL in animals, which presents much of the published material relevant to QTL detection by linkage in a coherent and accessible manner. The text takes the reader from setting the scene with the historical perspective through QTL mapping in inbred line crosses to QTL mapping using the various study designs possible in livestock. In a series of further chapters the book explores issues such as statistical power to detect QTL and optimisation of experimental designs, the setting significance thresholds and methods for fine mapping of QTL and multiple trait QTL analysis. Four chapters at the end explore selection in livestock, including theory and simulation studies in marker assisted selection and introgression. The book focuses mainly on the theoretical aspects of QTL analysis and results of simulation studies. There is little discussion of actual results or summaries of conclusions so far. There is also little discussion of the various software available for QTL analysis, thus the book will be of more interest to the theoretically minded, rather than the practitioner who wants to get their hands dirty with analysis. The â€˜animalâ€™ in the title does not include humans, so there is little direct mention of developments specifically applied in studies of man. The biggest omission as far as livestock are concerned is that the book stops short of mapping applications that utilise disequilibrium at the population level and this must be an area where many QTL studies in livestock will be undertaken in future. I would not agree with all of the conclusions presented in the book. For example the use of canononical transformation in multiple trait analyses has significant drawbacks and the interpretation of the false discovery rate criteria for assessing detected QTL has to be treated with care. Overall, however, there is much of value here and the book is certainly a must-have for anyone involved in the statistical analysis of QTL studies in livestock. It will also be of value to those interested in QTL analysis generally or in animal breeding and livestock genetics and a useful textbook for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students. Experimentalists should not expect to be able to plunge straight into data analysis having read this book, but an understanding based on this text would be of great value in helping them avoid the pitfalls that can often trap the unwary in such a statistical subject as QTL analysis.",2002,Biology,"list(name = ""Chris Haley"", ids = ""144901556"")",b2179a3040c0a0ed76e2ec7d41e7376137c58810; 10b1ec69e418c618501dd32ab258c9568373877b; 2f263ce3c753acc35bc73099d1757a56536615a6; d042a2a9f374c7a8bfce6b8bf5ac9727ad3c6050; 01204a52287efb21267a7bd207939559375afe80; 06b49ee8fcd0c1c1b9a35de05c749af9ee1f9e25; cdf330162ca50e1eb3b48203738654063ef57de0; d9f31707e7ff1d771bfc209e23b0983aa2509320; fe558dc6e63dc114867917719149f9afff62fe39; f596d248d4a9add6b1e9546090c224fa18f5ffdc; c0fff3e7f7bcd7c3fe1d7912db9d9f2757e2f510; 89726727460930169e9cc58138ae87ecee0fac34; 996cd46149df2985a4ca5b416ca1a71b7644c101; b8179a037f45e61e42764a4770de75bf1c06ecc8; 163ddc9d78c7e573ce86156145fad244a212e736; 7a53a8b8a021c585d7fa78a51e0584d3498ba528; ebf2c78a31467f7f10f8a005d6e856847d59f8e1; 58b7ed51fde2e0eabc867ff9a758d0ddc11708c4; d07bd40d88bf5f714afb493c24deb9c768329104; 036c9400ad3c3dcda31a62981943e06b7414c8e7; 6f4f5388b42be9ac1ada3e200cd79ea5d1262c22; 4b9582d4d293e28e2549120710410994c61113b2; 38b355c82682ce0d0e62835f856144faa2fc35b9; b952725119367b1a8a23728d74375e84d0177f7c; 7f287dda8abc4fcab1b1b3556f5b8b712fb7f717; d8e55c42fd82571ceb3641cab909fc4b7adcc2f7; 55cb8393b13730fb354ad9fe6d5549b5dbc7b8a8; 96298dd86d8885a2add3cc02c3d36b910f3bcba8; 8477f299c275278930d3810f81d8fcda889ce153; f02c85e8f4aa3dde8207ba0f8480951c3fec8940; 28a6074596ca164b673c7a6be91363b2261268ed; 7dd41e65964feeb66b6479bbb10911e1c04a6262; 642b777ad02fac10b416edb0eb291a4495dda5cf; d0b8c77953ef56ddd043f18cc09ed1af6ba27146; 011f1ef093cdd5fb8c1e4a6e21a3be2bd4b5e087; da3002a1035a036965951a5e8f4db37af439d7a5; 6eff10e356203d2407807d4aac8c1e8232a9cc31; 49de01896748cad3b5e28d8354f112190b98d5db; ed3d98d4673ea454feacd3f0306acfdc93360ca3; aa4c24b69713161fff5c49e226ff23e8faf91c52; 86d0130e8a9cb8e8d1db18a543ede15df4edcac6; 61e3c670124f1d56d3ed760a44bbbb849d6d3e1c; c6c76b0e9a95a749add93f81f36216e478c90eeb; 2c35fe94d8a158e00de5ce57ce14a11a8606ff17; 1061bdf4aebd1e86b3610626ca710cd8f369c332; 308fc6cbcf92ee82456f909af1e9fdafb21bf3be; a2caf167d08fca168ebedf2beef73dc6f5a13968; 88bd9153d9f47ee2b50d9099acb4b1d6885d1b14; 359516f0ae64fbddb766218b34dbc47fd7690d7d; 910dba53b940b71e82f5403a02c14611b802ac6a; 43bc2cabdc6c1b15fcce01f79b7a1cbbb99e5756; 408f1348e6f8d0a81806a7aa770ffa331938e577; 94bc0bf03bebba380e5d0011a85701820cc1f086; d5b04bff42945cd59f9175747c4e9f4f54f15aa0; d41ab31f3a0cc3330d1d9dd000e032ad9a8d746a; 1abf7c93f3352dd1ea796b4b9ce706df0cb618d9; 541ed9d654eb594e7c148e09ba1d7af46adb01ee; 3335c1410330a1afce11203f26a79905329902a8,,Heredity,88,486-486
de6ca84cb49f9a8ae130b859a03af1ec816da950,Vitamin D supplementation and lipoprotein metabolism: A randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND
Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an unfavorable lipid profile, but whether and how vitamin D supplementation affects lipid metabolism is unclear.


OBJECTIVE
To examine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on lipid and lipoprotein parameters.


METHODS
This is a post hoc analysis of the single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Styrian Vitamin D Hypertension Trial (2011-2014). Two hundred individuals with arterial hypertension and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of <75Â nmol/L were randomized to 2800 IU of vitamin D daily or placebo for 8 weeks.


RESULTS
One hundred sixty-three participants (62.2 [53.1-68.4] years of age; 46% women) had available lipid data and were included in this analysis. Vitamin D supplementation significantly increased total cholesterol, triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) triglycerides, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), LDL-ApoB, ApoCII, ApoCIII, phospholipids, and ApoE (PÂ <Â .05 for all). Except for ApoCII and ApoCIII and HDL-triglycerides, all other treatment effects remained statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing with the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate method. There was a nonsignificant increase in LDL cholesterol. Furthermore, no significant effects were seen on free fatty acids, lipoprotein (a), ApoAI, ApoAII, VLDL cholesterol, VLDL-ApoB, HDL cholesterol, LDL diameter, and VLDL diameter.


CONCLUSIONS
The effects of vitamin D on lipid metabolism are potentially unfavorable. They require further investigation in view of the wide use of vitamin D testing and treatment.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Verena Schwetz"", ids = ""6182275""); list(name = ""Hubert Scharnagl"", ids = ""6038447""); list(name = ""Christian Trummer"", ids = ""2024538""); list(name = ""Tatjana StojakoviÄ‡"", ids = ""3572876""); list(name = ""Marlene Pandis"", ids = ""7726427""); list(name = ""Martin R GrÃ¼bler"", ids = ""5428316""); list(name = ""Nicolas D Verheyen"", ids = ""5437413""); list(name = ""Martin Gaksch"", ids = ""4023234""); list(name = ""Armin Zittermann"", ids = ""5110083""); list(name = ""Felix Aberer"", ids = ""4233160""); list(name = ""Elisabeth Lerchbaum"", ids = ""4826067""); list(name = ""Barbara Obermayer-Pietsch"", ids = ""1422484465""); list(name = ""Thomas R.

We propose a global test for mediation, which combines a global test with the intersection-union principle. We discuss theoretical properties of our approach and conduct simulation studies that demonstrate that it performs equally well or better than its competitor. We also propose a multiple testing procedure, ScreenMin, that provides asymptotic control of either familywise error rate or false discovery rate when multiple groups of potential mediators are tested simultaneously.

27ceaeda7254cbd157196a6123bd5e29be157ef5,Identification of two molecular groups of seminomas by using expression and tissue microarrays.,"Highly effective tailored clinical management of testicular germ cell tumors is based on the identification of two major histologic subtypes: seminomatous and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. Expression array analysis of these two histologic subtypes using hierarchical clustering reveals two tumor groups, one composed solely of seminomas and the other containing embryonal carcinomas and seminomas. Supervised analysis between these groups identified 55 significantly dysregulated genes (false discovery rate = 2.3). The genes with the highest overexpression in the first group compared with the second included SLC43A1 (POV1), NET-7, IGF2, and JUP; down-regulated genes included GRB7, PFKP, and CDC6. In situ hybridization of SLC43A1 mRNA showed significantly increased signal intensity in the seminomas. At the protein level, expression of the immunohistochemical markers cytokeratins (pan-cytokeratin staining), placental-like alkaline phosphatase, anti-cytokeratin clone 5.2, CD30, anion exchanger 1/3, junction plakoglobulin (JUP), and POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1 (octomer-binding transcription factor 3/4) was significantly different between seminomas and embryonal tumors. Hierarchical clustering based on a refined protein expression profile identified two groups, the first consisting solely of seminomas the other of seminomas and embryonal carcinomas. No histomorphologic differences were observed between the two seminoma groups such as the presence or absence of lymphocytes or extent of stromal elements. In summary, using independent methodologies and samples, we have identified two groups of seminomas. One group of seminomas has a molecular profile similar to embryonal carcinoma. The findings in the current study may help explain aberrant immunoprofiles seen with some seminomas.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Matthias D.

c530e1c88afe98762be4ef3dfbf1d740bf3ac768,"Genetic variants in endotoxin pathway, endotoxin exposure and asthma exacerbations","Background: Environmental endotoxin exposure has diverse effects on asthma: exposure during early life may be protective against asthma development, but amongst patients with established disease current exposure induce symptoms and increase asthma severity. The endotoxin response pathway has the complex of innate immunity receptors (CD14/TLR4/ MD2) at the core. Among patients with asthma, we investigated the association between genetic variants in endotoxin pathway and severe asthma exacerbations. In addition, we evaluated the effect of endotoxin exposure in the context of genetic variants. Method: Four hundred and twenty- three children with asthma aged 5â€“18 years, were recruited into the study from the local hospital if the following criteria were met: 1 physician- diagnosed asthma, 2 asthma symptoms within the previous 12 months, and 3 use of asthma medication. Data on hospital admission with severe asthma exacerbations were extracted from medical records. We collected dust sample from childâ€™s mattress by vacuuming a 1 m2 area for 2 min. Endotoxin content was measured by a kinetic limulus assay. We genotyped 30 haplotype tagging SNPs (5 SNPs in CD14, 16 SNPs in TLR4 and 9 SNPs in MD2). Results: We observed one significant association between genetic variant on CD14 (rs5744455) and severe asthma exacerbations which remained significant after false discovery rate (FDR) correction [CC vs CT + TT, OR (95% CI), 2.42 (1.28â€“4.59), P = 0.006, FDR P value = 0.02). We observed significant interactions between 11 SNPs and environmental endotoxin exposure in relation to severe asthma exacerbation (4 in CD14, 4 in MD2 and 3in TLR4). Four described interactions (rs4914, rs2915862 and rs5744455 in CD14 and rs17226566 in MD2) remained significant after correction for multiple testing (P < 0.05). For example, endotoxin exposure increased the risk of hospital admission amongst patients with asthma who were T allele homozygotes in CD14 SNP rs5744455, with no effect of exposure amongst C allele carriers (P for interaction = 0.02, FDR p value = 0.04). Conclusion: We demonstrated that one genetic variant in CD14 (rs5744455) was associated with severe asthma exacerbation. In addition, interactions between 4 genetic variants in endotoxin pathway (3 in CD14 and 1 in MD2) and endotoxin exposure in relation to asthma exacerbation remained significant after FDR correction",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""BlaÅ¾enka KljaiÄ‡ BukviÄ‡"", ids = ""39517952""); list(name = ""Mario BlekiÄ‡"", ids = ""8711970""); list(name = ""Angela Simpson"", ids = ""145041280""); list(name = ""Susana Marinho"", ids = ""143618060""); list(name = ""Monika FeriÄ‡"", ids = ""14967396""); list(name = ""Neda Aberle"", ids = ""3676872""); list(name = ""Adnan Custovic"", ids = ""30541478"")",,,,,155
0c71b833f6269654c3644e8b51bfddbeafea30ee,Gene Expression in HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders: A Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES
To identify differentially expressed (DE) genes in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) patients in comparison with HIV-infected patients without HAND and controls.


DESIGN
A meta-analysis of publicly available gene expression data from HIV postmortem brain tissue studies.


METHODS
We selected studies using clearly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Within study data preprocessing and individual analyses were performed for each brain region. The following meta-analytic methods were applied: combining P values, combining effect sizes with and without a permutation method. The DE genes were defined with a false discovery rate less than 5% using Benjamini-Hochberg method.


RESULTS
Our meta-analysis on 3 studies encompasses analyses of over 48 postmortem brains [25 HAND, 7 HIV encephalitis (HIVE), 8 HIV-infected patients, and 8 controls]. Overall, 411 genes in white matter were DE in HAND with HIVE patients when comparing with controls. Of these, 94 genes were significantly expressed in all statistical methods. These 94 genes participate in significant pathways such as immune system, interferon response, or antigen presentation. Sixty-six of the 94 genes were significantly upregulated with log2 intensities greater than 2-fold. Strong examples of the highly upregulated genes were PSMB8-AS1, APOL6, TRIM69, PSME1, CTSB, HLA-E, GPNMB, UBE2L6, PSME2, NET1, CAPG, B2M, RPL38, GBP1, and PLSCR1. Only BTN3A2 was expressed in HAND with HIVE patients as compared with HAND patients without HIVE.


CONCLUSION
A number of genes were DE in our meta-analysis that were not identified in the individual analyses. The meta-analytic approach has increased statistical power for identifying DE genes in HAND.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Umaporn Siangphoe"", ids = ""46405456""); list(name = ""Kellie J.

d7e6a207d4f5e3349b51b63f8fac5ea7a312eb6b,Impaired type I interferon regulation in the blood transcriptome of recurrent asthma exacerbations,"BackgroundAsthma exacerbations are an important cause of morbidity in asthma. Respiratory infections are often involved in asthma exacerbations in both children and adults. Some individuals with asthma have increased susceptibility to viral infections and as a result increased rates of asthma exacerbations. We sought to identify a transcriptomic signature in the blood associated with asthma exacerbations triggered by respiratory infections (AETRI) and determine its association with increased risk for asthma exacerbations.MethodsWe conducted a two-step study using publicly available, previously generated transcriptomic signatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from asthmatics to identify novel markers of increased risk for asthma exacerbations. In the 1st step, we identified an in vitro PBMC signature in response to rhinovirus. In the 2nd step, we used the in vitro signature to filter PBMC transcripts in response to asthma exacerbations in an independent in vivo cohort. Three different subgroups were identified and studied in the in vivo cohort: 1. Single AETRI; 2. Multiple AETRIs; and 3. Single non-infectious asthma exacerbations. We performed pathway and network analyses in all independent comparisons. We also performed an immunologic gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the comparison between single AETRI and non-infectious asthma exacerbations.ResultsThe in vitro signature identified 4354 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a fold change (FC) â‰¥ 1.2, false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05. Subsequent analyses filtered by this in vitro signature on an independent cohort of adult asthma identified 238 DEGs (FCâ‰¥1.1, FDR <â€‰0.1) in subjects with a single AETRI and no DEGs in single non-infectious asthma exacerbations. A comparison between the response in subjects with single and multiple AETRIs identified two discordant gene subsets. In the largest discordant subset (nÂ =â€‰63 genes) we identified an impaired type I interferon and STAT1 response in multiple AETRIs during the acute phase of the exacerbation and an upregulated STAT1 response at baseline. The STAT1 upregulation at baseline in subjects with multiple AETRIs was accompanied by upregulation of pro-inflammatory molecules including IL-15, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), several toll-like receptors 2, âˆ’â€‰4, âˆ’â€‰5 and âˆ’â€‰8 and a triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1) network.ConclusionsSubjects with asthma and multiple AETRIs display a pro-inflammatory signature at baseline, associated with elevated STAT, IL-15 and ISGs, and an impaired STAT1 response during acute asthma exacerbations.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jose L Gomez"", ids = ""143859740""); list(name = ""MarÃ­a Paula DÃ­az"", ids = ""12316165""); list(name = ""Gustavo Nino"", ids = ""2836679""); list(name = ""Clemente J Britto"", ids = ""7325558"")",,cfa2294afac1e9777c33a09def6fcbc76bddcd29; 3f286139c8bda4c5044c2e7dfe8faf60d8972adb; c59b2c666d7c3026636684e55ef490246b583712; 549dd06cfb69e360f0d688e85eea69c9100862cc; d264f50515c2d5d8f7bda4b00b1ffedb568aca3d; dc0184eeb1fa0428a846dfd482887773f6a2dc73; 937e8b6ed3ca902addda7ed0c2056e9316884e5f; 08e955f5fd511f72786e2e04bb8a274fda5d4966; 13e6d58e6006bed58b0b67263ef94b3ac4c13293; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 251e40a3502ff24f7b1ccdba4d8e50f7b3472727; 44015d8b940f4129bce32de8be28a9866e307fac; 66a28d8ff229893f69ca2f17f137e0366c998063; 5cbf1c7e968c2649d09526c60e4826b450cb6eaf; 022c73fdbb857a447aa947bf674b330b0c48e55b; 305cd50f2d2dcfccb11f4003f6d077ee637b99c1; 7585ffcbe4659c8e12b385c8f13d8c2c36ecc13c; d276a59508031a52115720666e278ad40231c598; 26365d7694b3970852d4f41ac6ac0e0b2ca14c2c; a4f2d13624f5a6bc4a3439611e3df4c15cb87e02; ba3b50217a365349ce17a538fc71bb5184cce856; b71fcf05f970fd66c52c96cdcedf6528c5395119; bad28601d800d81d965acb56aa262af41575cac1; 84c8b23a56a03be673433ad7aed2bd5b8f43a942; 3dda54cb82e24c2a508f18da5d06abfec1775a1f; 5cd871695f0ecc4adfd1e04e6dc680ee86a2d69c; 03e7f5081f73e5dd43bb02939e10b648fa8a91a8; 530bc2f7f38378ed4907965f7dee4acd1502b40a; f8d71d588ed61ee3ccb1854940adf34e9c0227c7; b3af43e2a1f5593d490917d989c89ef2c06b350f; 6398b385ba3717e110a7813e4eb14374a0bfe063; 90d33d74ef30e3d6004a83d40181cacdba6def78; 633f780c77dd45f5e51543a6b41ecbcef0b40753; a59b61f930cce3ccbefd805141e733cfc970455e; f72d39340f78858a9500f730fdd5b93e9839e0c0; 10c9195b38905158b88d069a336bb9c2840080a1; d925f861857f5c673f0d898a82f2dc516df5060e; c6fffd66acdcb27c928605f7aca443056a3a6c3f; 3ae84dcafd441c472eca1c8fb8ed23c7acc57687,BMC Medical Genomics,11,
dd435cb40f737477f509773af4b2648bc47a210e,Towards improved biomarker studies of cervical neoplasia: effects of precolposcopic procedures on gene expression patterns.,"Among tumor sites, cervical cancer offers an ideal model for investigating differences in gene expression associated with transitions from normal to precancer and invasion to cancer. To evaluate the validity of assessing gene expression in cervical tissues acquired in a clinical setting, we investigated whether standard procedures, namely the application of acetic acid and/or Lugol's iodine, employed for the visualization of colposcopically directed biopsies, altered patterns in oligonucleotide (oligo) arrays. We compared microarray profiles from six women, each with three adjacent tissue samples removed from benign hysterectomy specimens and treated as follows: immediately frozen, acetic acid application only, acetic acid, and Lugol's iodine. Of the 22,464 original spots on the microarray, 4,850 spots were expressed at detectable levels for further evaluation upon data normalization and filtration. For each spot, the difference between topical applications was computed, and P values were calculated using a bivariate T2 test. Upon adjustment for multiple comparisons using both the Holm's and Hochberg's procedures as well as the False Discovery Rate (Benjamini-Hochberg and Benjamini-Yeuketili [BY]), we failed to identify genes differentially expressed and conclude that standard precolposcopic procedures do not substantially affect the overall gene expression patterns in the normal cervix.",2005,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sophia Wang"", ids = ""40658590""); list(name = ""Abhijit Dasgupta"", ids = ""35230960""); list(name = ""Mark E.

This measure is useful, for example, in assessing the overall univariate strength of a large set of features in microarray and other genomic and biomedical studies.

459314b546b1abf53e343f851844a9c37b8eb41b,"Comparison of Normalized DTI analytical methods II : Detection powers of voxel-based , atlas based , and sub-atlas based analysis","INTRODUCTION The voxel-based group analysis (VBA) is one of the most effectual assessment methods of the entire white matter (WM) of brain. However, the VBA often suffers from high false discovery rate (FDR), which caused by embedded noise in voxels and imperfect registration. To surmount this problem, the combination of the VBA with a pre-segmented WM has already been proposed [1]. On the other hand, 3D whole brain WM atlas (ABA: atlas-based analysis) was proposed to achieve statistical power on the examination of the WM analysis [2]. We also have proposed alternative way to analyse WM by sub-atlas based analysis (SBA) [3]. In this paper, we attempted to ascertain the statistical detection power and the features of VBA, ABA, and SBA. METHODS Subjects: ICBM-152 normal subjects data (n=21) [4], which were randomly selected from data set, were used. We performed dual channel (b0 and FA) affine transformation and a large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) for alignment [2] and computed FA values. Creation of a sub-atlas: Fig.1b shows the sub-atlas of corpus callosum (CC) [3]. A 3D plane was fit to each portion of parceled WM atlas (Fig.1a) and trimmed the hanging out portions of fitted plane. This process was applied to every parceled WM region and combined to create whole brain WM atlas plane. All voxels within a parceled atlas were projected to the nearest voxel on sub-atlas plane. The averaged value of the all projected voxels was assigned as the value of voxel on the sub-atlas. Embedding abnormal value: We embedded abnormal values within the rectangle area which covers body of CC (bCC, Fig.2a, purple colored). We set this rectangle was 100% abnormal area, which included 22 portions of parceled WM (fornix, anterior limb of internal capsule left (-L), right (-R), posterior limb of internal capsule-L, R, cingulum-L, -R, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus-L, -R, superior frontal blade-L, -R, post-central blade-L, -R, CC, corona radiata-L, -R). We changed abnormality covering area based on this rectangle from 10 to 100%. We also changed FA value of each voxel from 10 to 100% based on original values. Fig. 2(b and c) shows slices of 60% abnormal area 60% decreased FA (b: randomly arranged abnormal values, c: cluster arranged abnormal values). Comparison of detection power: We detected abnormality as the outlier of FA values on the same spatial position across the subjects (VBM-style analysis [1]) by using Grubbs-Smirnov (GS) test. The detection power of each method was defined as percentage of detected outliers per embedded abnormalities. In the case of VBA and SBA, the abnormalities were counted by voxels, whereas, the numbers of abnormal area were counted in the ABA. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Fig.3 shows the results of outlier test. The horizontal axis of the charts indicate the decreasing percentage of original FA value. Each bar shows the percentages of abnormal area, based on Fig.2a. The vertical axis shows the detection power. In the case of random abnormality, the detection power of ABA and SBA were clearly affected by both abnormal area and its value (Fig3, upper left, middle). On the other hand, the detection power of VBA was not affected abnormal area and it was only affected by abnormal values (Fig4, upper right). These results clearly reflect the features of each method on the detection problem. In the case of cluster abnormality, the detection power of ABA and SBA were also affected by both abnormal area and value (Fig3, lower left, middle). The detection power of VBA was affected by both abnormal area and value as well (Fig3, lower right). The reason of this discrepancy on VBA seemed to be based on the smoothed out by cluster abnormality. From the results, SBA and VBA showed better detection power on the cluster abnormal arrangement than the random abnormal arrangement. This means that the distribution of abnormal values affects the detection power of VBM-style examination methods. The extension of the area covered by abnormal values in the region of interest also affected the detection power of these methods. In the case of ABA, the cluster abnormal arrangement was well detected in higher detection power than in the case of random. On the other hand, the random abnormal arrangement was better detected in its lower area by ABA than cluster arrangement. The reason was that the abnormalities were higher value than the threshold of outlier which defines the ability of the test. When abnormal values covered relatively narrow area, the detection power was relatively higher than the wide-covered area by abnormal value on SBA and VBA (Fig3, middle and right). The reason was the averaging, which decides each voxel value, on the SBA. On the VBA, when abnormal values cover relatively wide area, wide-value-distribution occurs. This wide-value-distribution range across the subjects make hard to detect the abnormality by GS test. CONCLUSION The features of VBA, ABA, and SBA on the abnormality-detection problem were generally grasped. We attempt to compare ABA, VBA, and SBA. Nevertheless, there is still no direct way to compare ABA and other methods. Further study was required to create the method that can conquer both the smoothed-out problem of ABA and the FDR of VBA and SBA. The combination of ABA and VBA might confer us a new point of view.

c30b76ecb832db0f23de57c48aec9f7b4e66958c,Common Marker Genes Identified from Various Sample Types for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,"OBJECTIVE
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex auto-immune disease. Gene expression studies have been conducted to identify SLE-related genes in various types of samples. It is unknown whether there are common marker genes significant for SLE but independent of sample types, which may have potentials for follow-up translational research. The aim of this study is to identify common marker genes across various sample types for SLE.


METHODS
Based on four public microarray gene expression datasets for SLE covering three representative types of blood-born samples (monocyte; peripheral blood mononuclear cell, PBMC; whole blood), we utilized three statistics (fold-change, FC; t-test p value; false discovery rate adjusted p value) to scrutinize genes simultaneously regulated with SLE across various sample types. For common marker genes, we conducted the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and Protein-Protein Interaction analysis to gain insights into their functions.


RESULTS
We identified 10 common marker genes associated with SLE (IFI6, IFI27, IFI44L, OAS1, OAS2, EIF2AK2, PLSCR1, STAT1, RNASE2, and GSTO1). Significant up-regulation of IFI6, IFI27, and IFI44L with SLE was observed in all the studied sample types, though the FC was most striking in monocyte, compared with PBMC and whole blood (8.82-251.66 vs. 3.73-74.05 vs. 1.19-1.87). Eight of the above 10 genes, except RNASE2 and GSTO1, interact with each other and with known SLE susceptibility genes, participate in immune response, RNA and protein catabolism, and cell death.


CONCLUSION
Our data suggest that there exist common marker genes across various sample types for SLE. The 10 common marker genes, identified herein, deserve follow-up studies to dissert their potentials as diagnostic or therapeutic markers to predict SLE or treatment response.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Peng-Fei Bing"", ids = ""17854559""); list(name = ""Wei Xia"", ids = ""144529354""); list(name = ""Lan Wang"", ids = ""1727780""); list(name = ""Yong-Hong Zhang"", ids = ""40160774""); list(name = ""Shufeng Lei"", ids = ""2276400""); list(name = ""Fei-Yan Deng"", ids = ""144184148"")",5d4337b210d2acee75a5d8e32bded2d24d780b0f; 9a2f88f72fc63c3fbd2357d34500b9f91246551a; 737d4bb05a3b2b1b4f942dfa2b26b15b467a8aa8,d76f56f520a0ba24724a5dbf8ab427dc109734d0; 1ddef5a29bfd9cdde5084bc83c588aba8c4e3f3a; 193bac7f670123e9fa2a9e03ebee3b7d2f96dce6; 5ae516ce2983ad115dd44ec5575de780e69e2a69; a00ba38cddf2a2fd0560c21a0353523516ca5450; 2a890b06d9ad65c80acaeae941d0b4f3b5986896; dff0dec42b342951384f6604c3e7ab8c57bd536b; 038b57a8a1c2414ed62274e55d33572dfb245057; c6679cd2a65467fe0f4348e6e94620660ce77496; 62eeb6f2cf61abf2a1b11fb5c2372e5889ccaa00; 64b66b2eb1c070686e2800a2ca9ce45c606b18d6; 23cbffab314e837570d784d21989acd1db73a5fb; 340b8c717d19d92ea5e841c727409bf4cf573ca2; f52dc94ad8df108b80ca419229835a7bb999fd52; ca4e55032283db4e94d4563a7a7777d6c4f6da82; 4cbcedfc46db574d34026c3a08ca04d297dc73e2; 0c4d6b564d54c2f66c0d02b14a7fd5462ee1fdd9; b939076809c74b3d988f02aace9a0e876cdb0dc7; 409e014620e3263373c2d2557d155a8c091f1b25; e3831b9cf7292a29a87ba4574a61b78d0e555994; d3c305ef958a26168748e4a0f16f347270e5b2cb; 1dda2aa3b15f49f7a25985c8abdbd1f1d973220d; 647f8392f2979fdc5c8b0fa7b380d3df5a1977d2; 1823026160626ed2cd47de840d3829a7bb2ebb38; c4bf3456a872aec57aa1cf98224ec092f60f3c1a; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; 8ff9c69b57562cb3c1daba8b74ce13133176513e; 05f7478a0a1627c8ef416430fa66b8830686914e; 8fa05647672d152cc9cc4fd78721cf703aa7ae0b; 3daa1216f7e6f7118ecc52c5f453d05891214bab; a3f924389e1433e66b4b17685b5dfd373c14043a; 42bb0a27b50342862f36d5c63bdcbff7bf2c4e4a; 0126a59de7f5fea41a23c426def1b323fd3e6928; 10705b26dd821e3aaa21f82c6c489794bbc7c495,PLoS ONE,11,
bf4617ac984bfb8c525e37aa72d39d2c2ea14a66,WWC1 Genotype Modulates Age-Related Decline in Episodic Memory Function Across the Adult Life Span,"BACKGROUND
Episodic memory (EM) declines with age and the rate of decline is variable across individuals. A single nucleotide polymorphism (rs17070145) in the WWC1 gene that encodes the KIBRA protein critical for long-term potentiation and memory consolidation has previously been associated with EM performance, as well as differences in hippocampal engagement during EM tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the current study, we explore the effect of this polymorphism on EM-related activity and cognitive performance across the adult life span using fMRI.


METHODS
Two hundred thirty-two healthy, Caucasian subjects (18-89 years) completed a battery of cognitive tests, as well as an EM task during an fMRI scan.


RESULTS
WWC1 T carriers had significantly better delayed recall performance than CC individuals (p = .006). The relationship between increasing age and recall scores (immediate and delayed) was also significantly different between WWC1 genotype groups (p = .01). In addition to the age-related decline in hippocampal formation (HF) activation (p < .05; false discovery ratesmall volume correction-HF-region of interest), we observed an age by WWC1 genotype interaction on HF activation during encoding and retrieval. The CC group showed a significant negative association between HF activity and increasing age, while no such association was observed in the T carrier group (left HF p = .04; r-z correlation difference during encoding and retrieval; right HF p = .0008; r-z correlation difference during retrieval).

Our results show a dynamic relationship between rs17070145 polymorphism and increasing age on neuronal activity in the hippocampal region.",2014,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""John H.

ffc72e4a477eb3ea2e49ec6260f0c4ce34e80a24,Leptomeningeal Contrast Enhancement Is Related to Focal Cortical Thinning in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: A Cross-Sectional MRI Study.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Leptomeningeal inflammation is associated with the development of global cortical gray matter atrophy in multiple sclerosis. However, its association with localized loss of tissue remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between leptomeningeal contrast enhancement, a putative marker of leptomeningeal inflammation, and focal cortical thinning in MS.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Forty-three patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 15 with secondary-progressive MS were imaged on a 3T scanner. Cortical reconstruction was performed with FreeSurfer. Leptomeningeal contrast-enhancement foci were visually identified on 3D-FLAIR postcontrast images and confirmed using subtraction imaging. Leptomeningeal contrast-enhancement foci were mapped onto the cortex, and ROIs were obtained by dilating along the surface multiple times (n = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40). Resulting ROIs were then mapped onto the homologous region of the contralateral hemisphere. Paired t tests compared the thickness of the cortex surrounding individual leptomeningeal contrast-enhancement foci and the corresponding contralateral region. Results were corrected for the false discovery rate.


RESULTS
Differences between ipsilateral and contralateral ROIs progressively decreased with larger ROIs, but no significant effects were detected when considering the entire MS sample. In patients with relapsing-remitting MS only, significantly reduced cortical thickness was found for 5 dilations (-8.53%, corrected P = .04) and 10 dilations (-5.20%, corrected P = .044).


CONCLUSIONS
Focal leptomeningeal contrast enhancement is associated with reduced thickness of the surrounding cortex in patients with relapsing-remitting MS, but not in those with secondary-progressive MS. Our results suggest that pathology associated with the presence of leptomeningeal contrast-enhancement foci has a stronger, localized effect on cortical tissue loss earlier in the disease.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Niels P Bergsland"", ids = ""2599672""); list(name = ""Deepa P Ramasamy"", ids = ""144512855""); list(name = ""Eleonora Tavazzi"", ids = ""49647064""); list(name = ""D Hojnacki"", ids = ""4022399""); list(name = ""Bianca Weinstock-Guttman"", ids = ""1400467673""); list(name = ""Robert Zivadinov"", ids = ""2974446"")",ddf6b497db63ea4bace864853ff78057f9d8d1e4; fe0d131ba15306065b467658fbb155a7d5284f8d; 153e064df638c158138278c78b58d6f1e7ab4349,c65d341e1313e153cbce97dc9de38bbf6b94bcfc; a9d222d0f26b82fc2634be4fa8b2c413379bba0e; dece3eaa8b84dd2f28f1189ddfc26b6e5b065400; 9193f41ab4da31f739ddd8b1a6b3375055e03ad3; 82b25397c22b1d7c620f95eb7387f52eb7c19bbc; 055411f28a5e28c46c3f0079d397783afc721021; ddfe356f304424435179e9c2e94567c88db60ad0; b88d4399d262b8c816fd04da82778790b1d02132; 8b3be3ea8e35b605e92b4c29f2be0fbc1b733c44; 3dfcd6418364aadd5e9483a34c6fbecf4682f5f3; 8cfcc09912b538ded4ca905df9f2af338aba44ab; 3f9a57bf25698d541c27251e64c72e4817ef2e88; 574c21687781cc190c7e6cff8d0bcc00fc689b44; 498478133a68b28f8379ef3efdddd1217508c0ef; 39879d95f63d26fb6b0d82e76e319b8df77014b1; e8d4bbd456063fdb78ef33a1665b28ca775a6624; 5dbe95fe8d8ba33901ba5a194f51181a2b0166aa; ec14954ed9e84fecfd446516afede96c1041153c; 11d0690b40f85cc9cc862c0632ded51871c779c0; ddeba99a19a936ecc33fa26c042f6a347bf006f9; 84f2a80d7334c4816e929e7e866c097a50a06108; 04306dc8f092e8feb480af20a684d35f2508f304; c63ce1435f5cae671d97ad1ed815fc3f8087513c; b2ea12f2509ec317385ac41e76728b35ae2e6ddf; 2861c24bc829f963a594a5916a9ce9616b6486d7; e0810021df619da360e4780f7c07572fd7e2836f; 7d41b29fba2bf0a7f1f3f89caedf7572510813cb; 4995360a5cc908e26506f4823222406fa04d2f73; e5f0412bc4cb81aa24bae9d507fa605c1536d94a,AJNR.

530f8e43d1b04cab9f229d38993a05c2c0286a7c,A Genome-Wide CRISPR Screen Implicates MYC Dysregulation in TCF3 - PBX1 B-ALL,"Introduction: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common paediatric cancer, of which, precursor B-cell ALL (B-ALL) accounts for approximately 80% of diagnoses. B-ALL is a heterogeneous disease, with patients characterised and risk stratified according to their cytogenetic profile. TCF3-PBX1 B-ALL was associated with a poor prognosis, but on current therapies outcome has greatly improved. However, approximately 10% of these patients relapse with their disease and at this stage have a dismal prognosis (Moorman et. al. Lancet Oncology 2010). Thus, this subset of patients pose a clinical challenge, and further understanding of disease mechanisms in relapsed TCF3-PBX1 is required to aid the discovery of novel targets for therapy. Methods: Clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology was utilised as a whole genome CRISPR knockout (GeCKO) screen (Sanjana et. al. Nature Methods 2014) for genome-wide identification of candidate oncogene and tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) in B-ALL cell lines, including 697 (relapsed TCF3-PBX1), REH (ETV6-RUNX1), NALM16 (hypodiploid) and HAL-01 (TCF3-HLF). The GeCKO screens were performed at 300-fold library coverage, with transduced and selected cells harvested at day 0, weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8. DNA was sequenced across the integrated sgRNA region. The abundance of sgRNA constructs was analysed over time using the model-based analysis of genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (MAGeCK) program (Li et. al. Genome Biology 2014) to identify candidate oncogenes and TSGs. Pathway analysis was performed for the identification of significantly dysregulated pathways in TCF3-PBX1 using the 697 data set and the MaGeCK Gene Set Enrichment Analysis pathway program. Results: Whole genome CRISPR screening in the 697 cell line successfully identified 2213 candidate oncogenes (false discovery rate (FDR) Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ruth E.

b31c8e4763101f1dc1ed5b207bb321bf51340735,Multi-parametric MR Imaging Biomarkers Associated to Clinical Outcomes in Gliomas: A Systematic Review.,"PURPOSE
To systematically review evidence regarding the association of multiparametric biomarkers with clinical outcomes and their capacity to explain relevant subcompartments of gliomas.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Scopus database was searched for original journal papers from January 1st, 2007 to February 20th, 2017 according to PRISMA. Four hundred forty-nine abstracts of papers were reviewed and scored independently by two out of six authors. Based on those papers we analyzed associations between biomarkers, subcompartments within the tumor lesion, and clinical outcomes. From all the articles analyzed, the twenty-seven papers with the highest scores were highlighted to represent the evidence about MR imaging biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes. Similarly, eighteen studies defining subcompartments within the tumor region were also highlighted to represent the evidence of MR imaging biomarkers. Their reports were critically appraised according to the QUADAS-2 criteria.


RESULTS
It has been demonstrated that multi-parametric biomarkers are prepared for surrogating diagnosis, grading, segmentation, overall survival, progression-free survival, recurrence, molecular profiling and response to treatment in gliomas. Quantifications and radiomics features obtained from morphological exams (T1, T2, FLAIR, T1c), PWI (including DSC and DCE), diffusion (DWI, DTI) and chemical shift imaging (CSI) are the preferred MR biomarkers associated to clinical outcomes. Subcompartments relative to the peritumoral region, invasion, infiltration, proliferation, mass effect and pseudo flush, relapse compartments, gross tumor volumes, and highrisk regions have been defined to characterize the heterogeneity. For the majority of pairwise cooccurrences, we found no evidence to assert that observed co-occurrences were significantly different from their expected co-occurrences (Binomial test with False Discovery Rate correction, Î±=0.05). The co-occurrence among terms in the studied papers was found to be driven by their individual prevalence and trends in the literature.


CONCLUSION
Combinations of MR imaging biomarkers from morphological, PWI, DWI and CSI exams have demonstrated their capability to predict clinical outcomes in different management moments of gliomas. Whereas morphologic-derived compartments have been mostly studied during the last ten years, new multi-parametric MRI approaches have also been proposed to discover specific subcompartments of the tumors. MR biomarkers from those subcompartments show the local behavior within the heterogeneous tumor and may quantify the prognosis and response to treatment of gliomas.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Miquel Oltra-Sastre"", ids = ""1435572731""); list(name = ""Elies Fuster-GarcÃ­a"", ids = ""1388884748""); list(name = ""Javier Juan-AlbarracÃ­n"", ids = ""1388884796""); list(name = ""Carlos SÃ¡ez"", ids = ""144710059""); list(name = ""Alexandre Perez-Girbes"", ids = ""1402205300""); list(name = ""Roberto Sanz-Requena"", ids = ""1402205366""); list(name = ""Antonio Revert-Ventura"", ids = ""1435113456""); list(name = ""Antonio JosÃ© Jimenez Mocholi"", ids = ""88102068""); list(name = ""Javier F.

f8342f184985f75b8f903ee45b2d4d87a9469789,False Discovery Rates for Spatial Signals,"The problem of multiple testing for the presence of signal in spatial data can involve numerous locations. Traditionally, each location is tested separately for signal presence, but then the findings are reported in terms of clusters of nearby locations. This is an indication that the units of interest for testing are clusters rather than individual locations. The investigator may know a priori these more natural units or an approximation to them. We suggest testing these cluster units rather than individual locations, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio within the unit tested as well as reducing the number of hypothesis tests conducted. Because the signal may be absent from part of each cluster, we define a cluster as containing a signal if the signal is present somewhere within the cluster. We suggest controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) on clusters (i.e., the expected proportion of clusters rejected erroneously out of all clusters rejected) or its extension to general weights (WFDR).

304062cb5e1f98daa3f426e2d4f83ff3539242ed,Maternal Choline Supplementation during Normal Murine Pregnancy Alters the Placental Epigenome: Results of an Exploratory Study,"The placental epigenome regulates processes that affect placental and fetal development, and could be mediating some of the reported effects of maternal choline supplementation (MCS) on placental vascular development and nutrient delivery. As an extension of work previously conducted in pregnant mice, the current study sought to explore the effects of MCS on various epigenetic markers in the placenta. RNA and DNA were extracted from placentas collected on embryonic day 15.5 from pregnant mice fed a 1X or 4X choline diet, and were subjected to genome-wide sequencing procedures or mass-spectrometry-based assays to examine placental imprinted gene expression, DNA methylation patterns, and microRNA (miRNA) abundance. MCS yielded a higher (fold change = 1.63-2.25) expression of four imprinted genes (Ampd3, Tfpi2, Gatm and Aqp1) in the female placentas and a lower (fold change = 0.46-0.62) expression of three imprinted genes (Dcn, Qpct and Tnfrsf23) in the male placentas (false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤ 0.05 for both sexes). Methylation in the promoter regions of these genes and global placental DNA methylation were also affected (p â‰¤ 0.05). Additionally, a lower (fold change = 0.3; Punadjusted = 2.05 Ã— 10-4; FDR = 0.13) abundance of miR-2137 and a higher (fold change = 1.25-3.92; p < 0.05) expression of its target genes were detected in the 4X choline placentas. These data demonstrate that the placental epigenome is responsive to maternal choline intake during murine pregnancy and likely mediates some of the previously described choline-induced effects on placental and fetal outcomes.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sze Ting Cecilia Kwan"", ids = ""30517456""); list(name = ""Julia H King"", ids = ""40105314""); list(name = ""Jennifer K Grenier"", ids = ""34523021""); list(name = ""Jian Yan"", ids = ""9199256""); list(name = ""Xinyin Jiang"", ids = ""7325913""); list(name = ""Mark S Roberson"", ids = ""4829949""); list(name = ""Marie A Caudill"", ids = ""2187816"")",57c1990339306072570f94112249429efc3ea7a6; c356732cb7935f9d8437c75a81d9038207ce7f43; 54d55e472df1488fa4dc9add3cb84b64ff05d20e; 8a355f027438de1fdfecf2646efaf458b9d724db; e5f7699121a4d74a942313bd956619b8f39594e1; 778cd4d0a8e46cbfffb33b7161b4e34d5cf1d82b,8c4b88eb6634fc278fd3bedc57614018cf50a037; 8b8933aaae08ed666cabb4349ecf3ab4294a03c7; fe98f080788a860c7a10a972cfad406866d3882c; 5b9c6a2785995d4aa944006b8b5d579aa4a39d96; 6587a984b2f5f0b6b274b60bd0ec3a4cb34a6aa9; 78c039927ba4e8dc724ad6a1643a7d80c26ea11c; 9c325d6ad6326052f08b7ac2a3fc4bdbf37b6245; c258d0814ac16455fa48f752c22b3bd4bdce03c1; 2809ee267fa65ff01e39306047e8991f229b552f; a85e81f6f330dff0a5f55a2fe2c226e1d89ca5dc; 049d94226ca895d9a4e13baa4094c3d846195232; 3b16bb2a40be127a5c024413fd1790fb476c43a8; 5a662cc642c1037efdab295ef80d648ec1aa7139; 6ea6cb3916be71182ab2d66dc076393809ac241a; 1e5ba13ff0d015a4fd79d199bc72b13cb48fa8f3; 7b7e8ff52763083c6c90b90876610fecec366053; c0107fdba5acf771a73cde9c717a5e37342d7252; 5a84c553436fda9d19f9dfa0a7d6a5794de798dd; ede024e0e18573f36da61aa409da41d51d4d4909; f5353cb52a2eec2df49f29dfda165090a607e984; 56043f9e94278cf628acb5f193ac9b2c22ee44e7; 689a0535208fc9bde90b132ca842a7aa3999e1cf; 22e1d794bff0c0b7696ac0e4c93969234ced23f2; 553f497674b0e9a0b91c2677e7bbdf8b3185cb6e; aad5deed5bebe6ccb3573b0ea1a5d9b4aaee39bd; 55507aba54a92b31a200e8112f088f5c356ed7bc; f9ea494b0f99bcd2f75bb499115aa2aca0eeb2f6; cea22ff124c2ed7796889187018945ccb5e347b3; e41de34e6f9781113e8f83559adf57bc82911f73; 016e6eafc5c97cb2effaaebd518b04307ac95a9a; 4d289d7f1baab1bed28c01b37e3a4e4bad64f3ae; 1e09375e6e807198b841fe3be09a4214fbaa762e; 2141b467c5178c6462662b745d3395d63f40bad5; dfa58ddaa3e794e43e7dab33b34836a2a0ea9bee; 3be205eecbfdb4946da8ffe825e655d48300cf1c; aa10c07e23c29ed7793fd61f9e85681d873bb4bb; bebaef607b39ed7c5747e682ac79855224ce1ce2; a5aa596635f526cc3fb8b6aacc6fc3ef11adec0c; 118462d78320b6ccba616c12473749b222f37adb; dd5f267df08d7b81b29fa445106b867f38cd7819; 435fa55b32c6b581cacbfd11fe9d77ea119e667e; 0e86961e66e89da5aa96dda508f53a5c1f6b5731; 9df2e8bec07283a36353faa864ac879ba6f7de18; 630279166ba5f2125f8da75c987e1b16832d6c7e; db800d605307ce5f325ec6ed4bde72c7fe634ff1; e366aaba70b49bc53eb5f9c1c42867214d1ab0c2; e8abf6189c1aaf3da05903f6acd1c499f363b2ab; 4ec1a8708c5f7236ae15dff084ab093e09cdd5bb; 95fb47aaa82df796104840d10a1c0be79c21081e; 7e52445a90795a25117cf5be9955ab6a88ed05d6; d39d10bb7b3b690c5fe87088a25b8738b457bd64; 8cb1a92814238f5272fb1747efb7b59a474e3312; 55f4922440e2ea1b5a3ecbedaa60824e41c144da; e2aab9b4378dcdca8606c940d1d6299153a42939; 767557b5d54467fd6051db172cdb729d2cfd8932; e123ef4f1a4d124493764027ade28c07608d8081; 3ea4d1dd1edaaeedc7ff393faf7faedf783769f5; 1af5938a852570d2a5d8abd50fa0dc207f80df2d; a62320c957099fc4858726020c8574052f0ecbb5; 0da1f02085f4e9b1ba4693d7f345e418351b64d1; c43507715ca161e354ffb68ffd53161e376d21bb; 4b36e55473a197d927552c5089ff9649c54597ac; 3d6cf781a2b972b1e732e83da900a8cb61828594; 9b268efc7db6f62c4f269697a9e8b9f1cfd97da4; 5a26cf91b2b9d45b6301b45fb88c8c403b5e5948; 9387a927b07c82e73cf419e5029846ada9eb8902; 8ed1a289795b4cf3aec830c48886b2d886dec2f1; cf40bfb0a282c9d1f00f58ee18018bdd5e92b18e; 4476b44a22156a6ab4a4c659cacc5859b70901e0; ff0e1c9cca57d6373b8a2bad9d0a34a872ad8411; 6ce46fe2f2814333ecd2698da7c6d78858930623; e92f391ca1e9d7643834e2eda49956927a46ec5b; eb78c5774f0725ca41c6a3144ed6278bd44d4004; 4f903c8e6756945afd6ed14db41a15b8b6c5112f; 76ce7c1443ad43a5c345eedd2768d02a4ff8ed9a; 4070dc546e0de5f6f341fd80776c73511e04a8d7; 3deab3eb3736dc125912febb33e6f0c0fefd4ee8; ff51c3752225dd4fcd2c15d69bfbbb99d12e31cd; 19a1192a00af425657df06300ded089c442aecc8; 17d01d94092942d99625e2df0614a03977f64960,Nutrients,10,

Genotypes and 6 production traits: birth weight (BWT), weaning weight (WWT), ADG, DMI, midtest metabolic BW (MMWT), and residual feed intake (RFI), were used to estimate effects of individual SNP on the traits. At the genome-wide level false discovery rate (FDR < 10%), 41 and 5 SNP were found significantly associated with BWT and WWT, respectively. Thirty-three of them were located on BTA6. At a less stringent significance level (P < 0.001), 277 and 27 SNP were in association with single traits and multiple traits, respectively. Seventy-three SNP on BTA6 and were mostly associated with BW-related traits, and heavily located around 30 to 50Mb. Markers that significantly affected multiple traits appeared to impact them in same direction. In terms of the size of SNP effect, the significant SNP (P < 0.001) explained between 0.26 and 8.06% of the phenotypic variation in the traits. Pairs of traits with low genetic correlation, such as ADG vs. RFI or DMI vs. BWT, appeared to be controlled by 2 groups of SNP; 1 of them affected the traits in same direction, the other worked in opposite direction.

METHODS
2,469 men (1989-2006) with clinical T1-4, N0/X-N1, M0 prostate cancer received definitive RT +/- ADT (median follow-up: 70 months). The NCCN grouping was: low-risk included T1-T2a, GS < 7, and PSA < 10 ng/mL; intermediate-risk included T2b-2c, GS = 7, and PSA 10 - 20 ng/mL; high-risk included T3, GS 8, and PSA > 20 ng/mL. The Benjamini and Hochberg adjustment was used to compute the false discovery rates in order to adjust for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
There was a migration of stage II patients to stage I with version 7 (Stage I increased from 1% to 38%, while Stage II decreased from 91% to 55%). Pair-wise comparisons of Kaplan-Meier estimates of BF, DM, PCSS, and OS between stages were not statistically significant for AJCC v6 with one exception (PCSS: II vs III). On the other hand, 16/24 (67%) of comparisons were significant with AJCC v7. For NCCN, 9/12 (75%) of comparisons were significant, including all comparisons for OS. Concordance probability estimate (CPE) and standard error (SE) analysis showed uniform and significant improvement in the predictive power of AJCC v7 versus AJCC v6 for all outcomes. CPEÂ±SE values for AJCC v6 versus AJCC v7 was .51Â±.009 vs .59Â±.02 for BF, .54Â±.02 vs. .70Â±.05 for DM, .57Â±.009 vs. .76Â±.007 for PCSS, and .52Â±.006 vs. .57Â±.01 for OS. There was further, albeit modest improvement with the NCCN method. CPEÂ±SE values for AJCC v7 versus NCCN was .59Â±.02 vs. .59Â±.02 for BF, 0.70Â±.05 vs. 0.72Â±.05 for DM, .76Â±.007 vs. .80Â±.01 for PCSS, and .57Â±.01 vs. .57Â±.01 for OS.


CONCLUSIONS
AJCC v7 is a major improvement over AJCC v6 because it better distributes patients among the stages and is more prognostic. Further improvements are needed as the majority of men (55%) are Stage II and the sub-stratification into IIA and IIB was not prognostic. The NCCN model is superior to the AJCC v7 and remains the preferred method for risk-based clinical management of prostate cancer with RT +/- ADT.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mark Buyyounouski"", ids = ""4185210""); list(name = ""Nicholas G Zaorsky"", ids = ""6414439""); list(name = ""Tianyu Li"", ids = ""1934686""); list(name = ""Karthik Devarajan"", ids = ""46415818""); list(name = ""Eric Mark Horwitz"", ids = ""4466904"")",,,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,30 5_suppl,23
d40124228a23bee0b9545cdf96ffa6e7b30fb2f3,Aberrant Methylation and Decreased Expression of NRIP1 in IGHV-Unmutated CLL,"Aberrant DNA methylation patterning occurs in many cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Methylation programming changes as B cells differentiate from immature progenitors to mature B cells. CLL clones originate from a continuum of B cell maturation states, which differ in their ""methylome."" Emerging evidence suggests that aberrant methylation programming occurs at numerous genes that are differentially expressed in IGHV-defined CLL subtypes. Nuclear receptor interacting protein 1 (NRIP1) reproducibly shows significant gene expression differences in IGHV unmutated (U-CLL) and mutated CLL (M-CLL), with lower transcript levels observed in U-CLL cells. Low expression of NRIP1 is associated with poorer overall survival and time-to-treatment. NRIP1 encodes a cofactor that interacts with various nuclear receptors and other proteins to regulate transcription of genes involved in cellular proliferation, survival, metabolism, inflammation, and other processes. Published data reveal several CpG dinucleotides near the NRIP1 promoter that undergo increasing methylation during the maturation and differentiation of normal peripheral blood B cells (NBC), concordant with a stepwise decrease in transcript levels of NRIP1 over the course of maturation. Interestingly, our analysis of publically available expression data revealed significantly lower NRIP1 expression in U-CLL cells (the less mature CLL subtype) than NBC, while M-CLL cells (the more mature CLL subtype) express levels comparable to NBC. Given these observations, our objective was to interrogate the promoter and regulatory regions at the NRIP1 locus for differences in CpG methylation in genomic DNA isolated from U-CLL, M-CLL, and NBC. We hypothesized that the NRIP1 locus is more highly methylated in U-CLL than in M-CLL and NBC, and that this increased methylation represses NRIP1 gene transcription, contributing to its aberrantly low expression in U-CLL compared to M-CLL and NBC. We bisulfite-converted genomic DNA from negatively-selected CD19+ treatment-naive CLL samples (n=74 U-CLL, n=37 M-CLL) and NBC from healthy donors (n=5). We PCR-amplified regions in or near the CpG island of NRIP1 and used Agena Bioscience9s EpiTyper kit to prepare the samples for analysis on a MassARRAY spectrometer. EpiTyper software was used to detect mass differences that indicate either non-methylated or methylated CpG-containing fragments, and to calculate their relative frequency in each sample. For each CpG locus that was assayed, we fit a beta-regression model to detect differential methylation between M-CLL and U-CLL. We also computed Pearson correlation coefficients comparing methylation levels to gene expression levels. We assessed 47 CpGs mapping to the promoter and nearby regulatory elements of NRIP1 for methylation frequency and correlation with NRIP1 expression. From our comparison of methylation frequency in U-CLL and M-CLL, 3 adjacent CpG loci were significant at false discovery rate (FDR) =1% (CpG 58, p=0.00016; CpG 144, p=0.00062; and CpG 155, p=0.00287). The three most significant correlation coefficients arose from the same three CpG loci (CpG 58, R=0.677, p=2.2e-16; CpG 144, R=0.539, p=7.16e-10; CpG 155, R=0.651, p=5.77e-15). Unexpectedly, all 3 loci were methylated at higher levels in M-CLL and at lower levels in U-CLL (on average), and expression was positively correlated with methylation levels. These CpGs map near a documented binding site for the repressive transcription factor RUNX3, prompting us to hypothesize that differential methylation in U-CLL versus M-CLL may affect the binding affinity of RUNX3 and contribute to the robust NRIP1 expression differences in these CLL subtypes. Future work will test this hypothesis using gel-shift and luciferase reporter assays followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Few studies have focused on aberrant methylation patterning in CLL and the consequences of deregulated gene expression. We are the first to look at NRIP1 for differences in DNA methylation across IGHV subtypes. Future studies aimed at understanding how methylation at this locus affects NRIP1 transcription, as well as how levels of NRIP1 affect cell survival pathways, will enhance our understanding of the role of this gene in CLL, and the contributions of deregulated methylation to disease pathophysiology.

5495dd99aea3baeab9e1d903d34356a167264062,Genetic Variants Associated With Atrial Fibrillation and PR Interval Following Cardiac Surgery.,"OBJECTIVE
The authors hypothesized that genetic association between atrial fibrillation (AF)-associated and PR-associated genetic loci was biologically mediated through slower conduction velocities for some or all of these loci.


DESIGN
Prospectively collected cohort study.


SETTING
Single tertiary care university hospital.


PARTICIPANTS
A total of 1227 Caucasian patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).


INTERVENTIONS
A total of 677 single nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with ambulatory AF or PR interval were tested for association with postoperative atrial fibrillation (poAF) and preoperative PR interval, maximum PR interval, maximum change in PR interval, and maximum change in PR interval from preoperative PR interval.


MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS
The incidence of new-onset poAF was 31%. All of the PR interval variables were longer in the poAF cohort. Two variants on 1q21 and 12 on 4q25 were associated with poAF after adjustment for false discovery rate (FDR), but no variants were associated with PR interval variables after adjustment for FDR. Several variants were associated with both poAF and PR interval variables at p<0.05, but none of them remained significant after adjusting for FDR.


CONCLUSION
It was found that patients with poAF have significantly longer PR interval. Genetic variants in both the 1q21 and 4q25 regions associate with poAF after CABG surgery, but the authors were unable to find association between these variants and PR interval after adjusting for FDR.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Martin I.

4a5596b86b3331b57838a5dde68e32cb571d5574,IDH1 mutation-associated long non-coding RNA expression profile changes in glioma,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation is an important prognostic marker in glioma. However, its downstream effect remains incompletely understood. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of tumorigenesis in a number of human malignancies, including glioma. Here, we investigated whether and how lncRNA expression profiles would differ between gliomas with or without IDH1 mutation. By using our previously reported lncRNA mining approach, we performed lncRNA profiling in three public glioma microarray datasets. The differential lncRNA expression analysis was then conducted between mutant-type and wild-type IDH1 glioma samples. Comparison analysis identified 14 and 9 lncRNA probe sets that showed significantly altered expressions in astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors, respectively (fold changeÂ â‰¥Â 1.5, false discovery rateÂ â‰¤Â 0.1). Moreover, the differential expressions of these lncRNAs could be confirmed in the independent testing sets. Functional exploration of the lncRNAs by analyzing the lncRNAâ€”protein interactions revealed that these IDH1 mutation-associated lncRNAs were involved in multiple tumor-associated cellular processes, including metabolism, cell growth and apoptosis. Our data suggest the potential roles of lncRNA in gliomagenesis, and may help to understand the pathogenesis of gliomas associated with IDH1 mutation.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiao-qin Zhang"", ids = ""8443489""); list(name = ""Karrie Mei-Yee Kiang"", ids = ""13395895""); list(name = ""Yue-chun Wang"", ids = ""7707412""); list(name = ""Jenny Kan-suen Pu"", ids = ""3884839""); list(name = ""Amy S.W.

5a470e9bf4733a2a4c7bfc0c0419983e79627124,"Abstract 2227: Genomic study on prostate cancer disparities reveals the differential transcriptomes, microRNA profiles, alternative splicing patterns and copy number variations between Caucasian and African American populations","Prostate cancer (PCa) is a disease conferred by gene mutations, numerous alternations in gene expression and aberrant changes in genome composition/architecture. An area of research that continues to garner attention is PCa health disparities, wherein the African American (AA) population exhibits higher incidence and mortality rates compared to Caucasian Americans (CA). To identify the genetic predispositions and oncogenetic networks associated with the observed PCa disparities, we applied integrated genomic technologies to investigate RNA and microRNA expressions, alternative splicing events, and DNA copy number variations (CNVs) in AA and CA populations. RNA and DNA purified from PCa (Gleason score > 6) and paired adjacent normal prostate needle biopsies from AAs and CAs were processed and hybridized onto Affymetrix human Exon 1.0 ST and SNP 6.0 arrays. A 4-way statistical design (t-test with 10% false discovery rate) was employed to identify differentially expressed mRNAs in the following comparisons: AA normal vs. CA normal, AA cancer vs. CA cancer, AA cancer vs. AA normal, and CA cancer vs. CA normal. Pathway analyses of the differentially expressed genes (275 to 987 genes in the 4-way comparison) revealed network-level rewiring of gene interactions (e.g. gene networks or circuits) accounting for the PCa disparities between AA and CA. For example, the mis-regulated testosterone metabolism network in normal AA compared with normal CA tissues may represent a predisposition factor in the AA population; whereas the activated inflammatory response (NF-ÎºB network), up-regulated oncogenic signaling pathways (ERK, JNK and p38) and more aggressive cancer invasion and metastasis (highly expressed RHOA and STAT1) in AA carcinomas may associated with the higher recurrence and death rates in AA patients. In addition, our expression and CNV atlas have identified hundreds of genes exhibiting differential splicing patterns or copy number aberrations (deletions or amplifications) between the AAs and CAs, representing candidate genes mediating PCa disparities. Notably, at least 13 genes residing within the 5 oncogenic signaling pathways have been identified as exhibiting either differential splicing (in FGFR3, PDGFRA, MET, EPHA3, NF1, RASGRP2, GSK3, TSC2, ATM, RAF, and RB1) or CNVs (at EPHA, PTEN and APC) between AA and CA PCa specimens. Taken together, our data suggest that gene-network rewiring, mRNA splicing and CNV may play important roles in the PCa health disparities between AA and CA populations. Further identification of these critical genetic elements related to PCa disparities may facilitate the development of biomarkers for screening, early detection, and prediction of clinical outcome.

High-frequency electroencephalographic activity in childhood epilepsy,"High-frequency (HF) activity in electroencephalogram (EEG) is closely related to both epileptogenicity/ictogenicity and physiological cognitive function. HF activity beyond the beta band includes the gamma, ripple, and fast ripple bands. We have investigated HF activity in children with epileptic encephalopathy. In the pathophysiology of epileptic encephalopathy, cognitive impairment is suggested to be linked to scalp epileptic gamma rhythms that may represent the slower part of cortical HF oscillations in West syndrome. In epilepsy with continuous spike-waves during slow wave sleep (CSWS), the disturbance of higher brain functions may be related to spike-associated scalp ripple oscillations. HF oscillations have also been detected from the ictal cortical EEG of a rat model of channelopathy with SCN1A mutation. The technique to explore HF activity, however, is demanding and requires further development. A statistical comparison of HF activity through a timeâ€“frequency analysis between epileptic discharges and the background allows an objective identification of changes in HF power. Although the obtained statistical spectrum is noisy in the uncontrolled form, it can be rendered noiseless and easy to interpret with a control technique that employs the false discovery rate (FDR).",2013,Psychology,"list(name = ""Katsuhiro Kobayashi"", ids = ""13031838"")",,,Clinical Neurophysiology,124,
b84d8b195c68b1f6371b001b2494e5d8b0b81912,Adaptive Sign Error Control,"In multiple testing scenarios, typically the sign of a parameter is inferred when its estimate exceeds some significance threshold in absolute value. Typically, the significance threshold is chosen to control the experimentwise type I error rate, family-wise type I error rate or the false discovery rate. However, controlling these error rates does not explicitly control the sign error rate. In this paper, we propose two procedures for adaptively selecting an experimentwise significance threshold in order to control the sign error rate.

d8bb762048299afe20587b71c435d68c1ba517c7,Microarray Data: A Powerful Method forIdentifying Differentially Expressed Genes,"Microarray technology observing thousands of gene expressions at once, has been the most popular research topics in recent decades. The new data promise to improve fundamental understanding of life on a molecular level and may prove very helpful in medical diagnosis, treatment and drug design. Identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes across tissue samples or experimental conditions for the analysis of microarray data is the greatest challenge nowadays. Several approaches have already been used to improve the identification of DE genes. In this study, the most popular methods such as Significance Analysis of Microarrays, two Samples Mean Test (t-test) and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Sum test are applied to detect the DE genes in microarray cancer datasets. Our result shows a small number of common genes for the colon cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer analysis by using t-test, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Sum test and Significance Analysis of Microarray, respectively. Among the analytical results, ttest provides the highest classification accuracy according to False Discovery Rate. Although all of these methods give similarly good results in the microarray data, t-test represents the best performance among them for real datasets. This study shows practical evaluation frameworks of checking powerful methods for identifying DE genes in microarray data.",2018,,"list(name = ""Md.

We used a proteomic approach to characterize the alterations in protein profiles caused by the inducer bacterium in the hemolymph of the termite. Nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified a total of 221 proteins and approximately 70% of these proteins could be associated with biological processes and molecular functions. Challenges with these human pathogens induced a total of 57 proteins (35 in MRSA-challenged, 16 in P. aeruginosa-challenged, and 6 shared by both treatments) and suppressed 13 proteins by both pathogens. Quasi-Poisson likelihood modeling with false discovery rate adjustment identified a total of 18 and 40 proteins that were differentially expressed at least 2.5-fold in response to MRSA and P. aeruginosa-challenge, respectively. We selected 7 differentially expressed proteins and verified their gene expression levels via quantitative real-time RT-PCR.

The data of GSE4648 downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database include 6 time points (15 min, 60 min, 4h, 12h, 24h and 48 h) of 12 left ventricle (LV) samples, 12 surviving LV free wall (FW) samples, 12 inter-ventricular septum (IVS) samples after AMI operation and corresponding sham-operated samples. The data of each sample were analyzed with Affy and Bioconductor packages, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out using BETR package with false discovery rate (FDR)<0.01. Then, functional enrichment analysis for DEGs was conducted with Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Totally 194 DEGs were identified in LV, and only the gene tubulin beta 2a (Tubb2a) and natriuretic peptide B (Nppb) were respectively up-regulated in surviving FW tissue and IVS tissue. The biological process response to wounding and inflammatory response were significantly enriched, as well as leukocyte transendothelial migration pathway. Besides, the expression pattern analysis showed the DEGs mostly up-regulated at 4h after AMI, and these genes were mainly associated with immunity. Additionally, in transcriptional regulatory network, early growth response 1 (Egr1), activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3), Atf4, Myc and Fos were considered as the key transcription factors related to immune response. The key transcription factors and potential target genes might provide new information for the development of AMI, and leukocyte transendothelial migration pathway might play a vital role in AMI.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tong Zhang"", ids = ""144037658""); list(name = ""Li-Li Zhao"", ids = ""7900645""); list(name = ""Xue bin Cao"", ids = ""7300052""); list(name = ""Li-Chun Qi"", ids = ""123813181""); list(name = ""Guo-qian Wei"", ids = ""11627399""); list(name = ""Jun-yan Liu"", ids = ""49722789""); list(name = ""Shujun Yan"", ids = ""47188725""); list(name = ""Jin-gang Liu"", ids = ""48211034""); list(name = ""Xue-qi Li"", ids = ""7823159"")",c3933136eb4e460f18615cc3080e28c8a8aec610; 47bd5498abae9ce2db4ba94958392302ac76126d; 1755c8fae725fb0106169a506503236ac5681699; 05e14760bbc226b5a890862b11859c28faca4150; c331bf0de53c2353f6e133e65a2c3fe86890e9ea; 2d8e6ca02f0c7acbc52333df5cca55711c81ebd3; f7bb73d5798ca2a28c9720ec890508545694cd43; 67c2dc012080c9b58115ed702bfd56c6786bb581; 9ef7d94744ed9a36959549a7966869122fd69af6; d4f5b6123e0f00d4fda988f22109823b9d7de2c6; 2bed2e6133a5fa778cbfaf31a343b687c8c812b6; ffb654ab701a4cfb20ec333fbb8f7e710674c320; 2eb1d93717ec7cc2fb7e1cf9809299a2c0192c1c; 06938a2068352e46fc57f5b6d960f2acfbe531ec; 8e2c3f9d16f71e842c883ef5d79531a98a40373c; dd801d9f6118ba41041c5c96ca9c6e65c421027f; 94be3fe707bc293c9b440e6d6a92b3fa7a8a5972,,Gene,543 2,"

Although many methods for gene set analysis have been proposed, a systematic analysis tool for identification of different types of gene set significance modules has not been developed previously. This work presents an R package, called MAVTgsa, which includes three different methods for integrated gene set enrichment analysis. (1) The one-sided OLS (ordinary least squares) test detects coordinated changes of genes in gene set in one direction, either up- or downregulation. (2) The two-sided MANOVA (multivariate analysis variance) detects changes both up- and downregulation for studying two or more experimental conditions. (3) A random forests-based procedure is to identify gene sets that can accurately predict samples from different experimental conditions or are associated with the continuous phenotypes. MAVTgsa computes the P values and FDR (false discovery rate) q-value for all gene sets in the study.

b4e20e380f7389db1f005f249fff37c1ad536a3b,Patterns of cortical thinning in different subgroups of schizophrenia.,"BACKGROUND
Alterations of cortical thickness have been shown in imaging studies of schizophrenia but it is unclear to what extent they are related to disease phenotype (including symptom profile) or other aspects such as genetic liability, disease onset and disease progression.


AIMS
To test the hypothesis that cortical thinning would vary across different subgroups of patients with chronic schizophrenia, delineated according to their symptom profiles.


METHOD
We compared high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging data of 87 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia with 108 controls to detect changes in cortical thickness across the entire brain (P<0.05, false discovery rate-adjusted). The patient group was divided into three subgroups, consisting of patients with predominantly negative, disorganised or paranoid symptoms.


RESULTS
The negative symptoms subgroup showed the most extensive cortical thinning, whereas thinning in the other subgroups was focused in prefrontal and temporal cortical subregions.

c1e9a72a3882c140e72db4a3ca9bb1c194ade21e,Multivariate analysis of a genome-wide association study in dairy cattle.,"Multiple-trait genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses were compared with single-trait GWAS for power to discover and subsequently validate genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNP) associated with dairy traits. The SNP associations were discovered in 1 Holstein population and validated in both a Holstein population consisting of bulls younger than those in the discovery population and a Jersey population. The multivariate methods used were a principal component analysis and a series of bivariate analyses. The statistical power of detecting associations using multiple-trait GWAS was as good as or better than that of the best single-trait GWAS. Additional SNP associations were found with the multivariate methods that had not been discovered in the single-trait analyses; this was achieved without an increase in the false discovery rate. From the multivariate analysis, 4 common pleiotropic patterns were identified among the putative quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting the Australian selection index. These patterns could be interpreted as a primary effect of the putative QTL on 1 or more milk components and secondary effects on other components. The multivariate analysis did not appear to increase the precision with which putative QTL were mapped.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sunduimijid Bolormaa"", ids = ""4607755""); list(name = ""Jennie E.

31b391cdfcaf64e418020caa37ed16414be2092e,SWI/SNF gene variants and glioma risk and outcome.,"BACKGROUND
The human SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex plays essential roles in a variety of cellular processes and has been implicated in human cancer. However, the role of germline genetic variants in this complex in relation to cancer risk is not well studied.


METHODS
We assessed the association of 16 variants in the catalytic subunits (SMARCA2 and SMARCA4) of the SWI/SNF complex with the risk of glioma subtypes (lower grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma [GBM]) and with mortality from high-grade tumors (GBM) in a multicenter US case-control study that included 561 cases and 574 controls. Associations were estimated with odds ratios (OR, for risk) or hazards ratios (HR, for mortality) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). False discovery rate (FDR-q) was used to control for multiple testing in risk associations.


RESULTS
None of the investigated SNPs was associated with overall glioma risk. However, analyses according to histological subtypes revealed a statistically significant increased risk of oligodendroglioma in association with SMARCA2 rs2296212 (OR = 4.05, 95% CI = 1.11-14.80, P = 0.030, q = 0.08) and rs4741651 (OR = 4.68, 95% CI = 1.43-15.30, P = 0.011, q = 0.08) and SMARCA4 rs11672232 (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.01-3.58, P = 0.048, q = 0.08) and rs12232780 (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.06-4.33, P = 0.035, q = 0.08). No significant risk associations were observed for GBM or lower grade astrocytoma. Suggestive associations with GBM mortality were not validated in the Cancer Genome Atlas.


CONCLUSION
Our findings suggest that genetic variants in SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 influence the risk of oligodendroglioma. Further research is warranted on the SWI/SNF complex genes and epigenetic mechanisms more generally in the development of glioma in adults.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ernest K Amankwah"", ids = ""4211842""); list(name = ""Reid Carleton Thompson"", ids = ""144733439""); list(name = ""L.

Seven fractions were collected and analyzed by CZE-ESI-MS/MS. The separation was performed in a 60-cm-long linear polyacrylamide-coated capillary with a 0.1% v/v formic acid separation buffer. An electrokinetic sheath-flow electrospray interface was used to couple the separation capillary with an Orbitrap-Velos operating in higher-energy collisional dissociation mode. Each CZE-ESI-MS/MS run lasted 50 min and total MS time was 350 min. A total of 23Â 706 peptide spectra matches, 4902 peptide IDs, and 871 protein group IDs were generated using MASCOT with false discovery rate less than 1% on the peptide level. The total mass spectrometer analysis time was less than 6 h, the sample identification rate (145 proteins/h) was more than two times higher than previous studies of the E. coli proteome, and the amount of sample consumed (<1 Î¼g) was roughly fourfold less than previous studies.

Recent therapeutic approaches aim to mimic RAS extinction by interfering with critical signaling pathways downstream of the mutant protein. This study investigates the phosphoproteome of primary human melanocytes bearing mutations in the two hot spots of NRAS, NRAS(G12) and NRAS(Q61). Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture followed by mass spectrometry identified 14,155 spectra of 3,371 unique phosphopeptides mapping to 1,159 proteins (false discovery rate < 2%). Data revealed pronounced PI3K/AKT signaling in NRAS(G12V) mutant cells and pronounced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in NRAS(Q61L) variants. Computer-based prediction models for kinases involved, revealed that CK2Î± is significantly overrepresented in primary human melanocytes bearing NRAS(Q61L) mutations. Similar differences were found in human NRAS(Q61) mutant melanoma cell lines that were also more sensitive to pharmacologic CK2Î± inhibition compared with NRAS(G12) mutant cells. Furthermore, CK2Î± levels were pronounced in patient samples of NRAS(Q61) mutant melanoma at the mRNA and protein level. The preclinical findings of this study reveal that codon 12 and 61 mutant NRAS cells have distinct signaling characteristics that could allow for the development of more effective, mutation-specific treatment modalities.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christian Posch"", ids = ""1786896""); list(name = ""Martina Sanlorenzo"", ids = ""6194668""); list(name = ""Igor Vujic"", ids = ""49053481""); list(name = ""Juan A.

882185a10fc05eaddc7f72fdeefa3f051fcc1291,Enhanced interferon signaling pathway in oral cancer revealed by quantitative proteome analysis of microdissected specimens using 16O/18O labeling and integrated two-dimensional LC-ESI-MALDI tandem MS.,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains one of the most common cancers worldwide, and the mortality rate of this disease has increased in recent years. No molecular markers are available to assist with the early detection and therapeutic evaluation of OSCC; thus, identification of differentially expressed proteins may assist with the detection of potential disease markers and shed light on the molecular mechanisms of OSCC pathogenesis. We performed a multidimensional (16)O/(18)O proteomics analysis using an integrated ESI-ion trap and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS system and a computational data analysis pipeline to identify proteins that are differentially expressed in microdissected OSCC tumor cells relative to adjacent non-tumor epithelia. We identified 1233 unique proteins in microdissected oral squamous epithelia obtained from three pairs of OSCC specimens with a false discovery rate of <3%. Among these, 977 proteins were quantified between tumor and non-tumor cells. Our data revealed 80 dysregulated proteins (53 up-regulated and 27 down-regulated) when a 2.5-fold change was used as the threshold. Immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analyses were performed to confirm the overexpression of 12 up-regulated proteins in OSCC tissues. When the biological roles of 80 differentially expressed proteins were assessed via MetaCore analysis, the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway emerged as one of the most significantly altered pathways in OSCC. As many as 20% (10 of 53) of the up-regulated proteins belonged to the IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) family, including ubiquitin cross-reactive protein (UCRP)/ISG15. Using head-and-neck cancer tissue microarrays, we determined that UCRP is overexpressed in the majority of cheek and tongue cancers and in several cases of larynx cancer. In addition, we found that IFN-beta stimulates UCRP expression in oral cancer cells and enhances their motility in vitro. Our findings shed new light on OSCC pathogenesis and provide a basis for the future development of novel biomarkers.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lang-Ming Chi"", ids = ""37361183""); list(name = ""Chien-Wei Lee"", ids = ""123159917""); list(name = ""Kai-Ping Chang"", ids = ""145878289""); list(name = ""Sheng-po Hao"", ids = ""34394085""); list(name = ""Hang-mao Lee"", ids = ""39834193""); list(name = ""Ying Liang"", ids = ""144789329""); list(name = ""Chuen Hsueh"", ids = ""144215107""); list(name = ""Chia-Jung Yu"", ids = ""48267379""); list(name = ""I-Neng Lee"", ids = ""48294021""); list(name = ""Yin-Ju Chang"", ids = ""15028348""); list(name = ""Soo-Hyung Lee"", ids = ""8569373""); list(name = ""Yuan-Ming Yeh"", ids = ""1809359""); list(name = ""Yu-Sun Chang"", ids = ""6931201""); list(name = ""Kun-Yi Chien"", ids = ""2954274""); list(name = ""Jau-Song Yu"", ids = ""87029851"")",535b76514a68c3347ef8a3bcc4d91461c0351331; bdedfbd13142030300dff30191d9b0e0cf3a0678; ddfc7b98b14f6cd9a585ca79a82fb74038a3d7dd; 0cca91490b852069c25a38e9a25f87fa4c919347; 29c0d6a4a1c0abb4c9fd03ba8272afd5a43d23d3; 2ccad14057143d903ec4c20e30e6251133ac80db; 181f9e91f1c14159d8a92a28d8c60cc83c998a70; 691f2d590e27d167c8378e09bee439188d2c8a74; a8a25680c9e648760e408a30d6ef0dd153c15a24; 5be27815460738b10023a5a6acbc937473f6b2ed; 895a75238d7c6c62ef2562178eb608d08e031004; cbf5e30f7846a5c0bf23d707c1041e84dd7eef2c; e7b56822834b12cbe31b3236841706a172ce5649; 085af841319f86e059306e495b60a026905386b4; 191e31ca4fd8ced01240eed5ca8b4d256bc95ad9; 5f90f97620de6647a97f61c59cdeaa99bdd31c73; 6bd9039c64c7ab9499468f8c96a61c2c664cf9ed; bb3af216aedf13ade5251c21826a8f01aa84eddd; ef37cca3c73096495ef8c83a3d708018b83b3fce; 0f811bf6abfe3320fa0a977e2962b2cbbac12bc5; f0dfb254305f9c2bacab2239715dfbc37a963498; 9586dec5f91895e4257ad20d54e07dfdce323ac3; a884fd7881d39369b012b659d6da697ddabb5797; 70bc139a4b2a65014a015ab8fceefe9aef17c4d3; 3b59cb43288eafe058a8d0298799ee51b63da887; 1799c8be7747e55ba972997733cde78a0f97cdb4; 828133eb6f0dfaa69ad469d8ed7dc07ed6293fe8; 36edc732cc464795acc1934effc8d5781d4b0001; 397912ed4f3581ed202977a25738762275146fc0; 2a03bd56826fabb4b5a85a156c271acb06bc6d8f; a54fe19e1b96958670e6181de0840d6327997242; 11d1968e03937d83a0399568289f6706afc903b3; 7bc82d954d2dfb287cffa8bd38cba606b2e8515d; 80a818c039d0c7cdc62af667a55e9b23cc572096; 4b7c2c943d75550e456368d98f0987c8905e66ed; 2b6cf9fb79b1d132ee22e777ec3e37330d35be51; fd29371e506a5b31cca7a119b3cd49f937a63cbf; d09d18d752f841925b12f82f3197dbe34f8e7a70; b5968e6e1c12c843062a43f860715e346f58dd79; b9697ca8d9bb4c6184446b24ac24330005f6b90f; 1305c6433a9afb28cd367750d172d48e32189206; 053f4c97d38b1170736839ae910126fcc7ce1e1d; e970683b1836b568624afa76f1156b5e7ade79c6; 06dfbdd82ba38ba6125d7d09175e7dc9ffce53a3; 68bdd076b252c25dc411f1c6d9f9adb8659fcbeb; 4de644c78f2772e3dc4ed9bbdeea38a8e239054b; 1bf94f6262dae362b124092e3e8e2a5d52500758; efc735dc4efe2f21450992a017206953764eba8a; 7f12356f1a66e7a030ebc4e05570c5b22071b3e3; c72d33d9e144e0922d4ce7320b8fdd8b179e8f59; 1e5bee752498330e8b6020edaa0c12ff1732b11e; 3d164f5ad552f01e3346f547fa33f995952a97da,,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,8 7,"

The raw data were preprocessed, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between ESCC and normal samples were identified by using SAM software (false discovery rate <0.001). Then, the co-expression network of DEGs was constructed based on Pearsonâ€™s correlation test (r-value â‰¥0.8). Furthermore, the topological properties of the co-expression network were analyzed through NetworkAnalyzer (default settings) of Cytoscape. The expression fold changes of DEGs and topological properties were utilized to identify the candidate genes of ESCC (Crin score >4), which were further analyzed based on DAVID functional enrichment analysis (P-value <0.05).ResultsA total of 1,063 DEGs were identified, including 490 up-regulated and 573 down-regulated DEGs. Then, the co-expression network of DEGs was constructed, containing 999 nodes and 46,323 edges. Based on the expression fold changes of DEGs and the topological properties of the co-expression network, DEGs were ranked, and the top 24 genes were candidate genes of ESCC, such as CRISP3, EREG, CXCR2, and CRNN. Furthermore, the 24 genes were significantly enriched in bio-functions regarding cell differentiation, glucan biosynthetic process and immune response.ConclusionThe present study suggested that CRISP3, EREG, CXCR2, and CRNN might be causative genes of ESCC, and play vital roles in the development of ESCC.

457cbffbc3301253293c6fdc1b0d9c4b4006c31c,Analysis of lncRNA-Associated ceRNA Network Reveals Potential lncRNA Biomarkers in Human Colon Adenocarcinoma,"Background/Aims: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) play significant roles in the development of tumors, but the functions of specific lncRNAs and lncRNA-related ceRNA networks have not been fully elucidated for colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). In this study, we aimed to clarify the lncRNA-microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA ceRNA network and potential lncRNA biomarkers in COAD. Methods: We extracted data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified COAD-specific mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs. The biological processes in Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were analyzed for COAD-specific mRNAs. We then constructed a ceRNA network of COAD-specific mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs and analyzed the correlation between expression patterns and clinical features of the lncRNAs involved. After identifying potential mRNA targets of 4 lncRNAs related to overall survival (OS), we conducted stepwise analysis of these targets through GO and KEGG. Using tissue samples from our own patients, we also verified certain analytical results using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Results: Data from 521 samples (480 tumor tissue and 41 adjacent non-tumor tissue samples) were extracted from TCGA. A total of 258 specific lncRNAs, 206 specific miRNAs, and 1467 specific mRNAs were identified (absolute log2 [fold change] > 2, false discovery rate < 0.01). Analysis of KEGG revealed that specific mRNAs were enriched in cancer-related pathways. The ceRNA network was constructed with 64 lncRNAs, 18 miRNAs, and 42 mRNAs. Among these lncRNAs involved in the network, 3 lncRNAs (LINC00355, HULC, and IGF2-AS) were confirmed to be associated with certain clinical features and 4 lncRNAs (HOTAIR, LINC00355, KCNQ1OT1, and TSSC1-IT1) were found to be negatively linked to OS (log-rank p < 0.05). KEGG showed that the potential mRNA targets of these 4 lncRNAs may be concentrated in the MAPK pathway. Certain results were validated by qRT-PCR.

2ad2468a73cff1650780d991dbf7a15310ac9572,Associations of glutamate decarboxylase genes with initial sensitivity and age-at-onset of alcohol dependence in the Irish Affected Sib Pair Study of Alcohol Dependence.,"BACKGROUND
The relation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to alcohol dependence (AD) has been widely studied. Several previous studies suggest that GABA may be involved in alcohol withdrawal, tolerance, and the symptoms that form an AD diagnosis. The genes coding for glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), the rate-limiting enzyme in GABA synthesis, are of potential interest for their association to ethanol consumption and AD. There are two isoforms of GAD, GAD1 and GAD2, which were reported to be associated with AD in males of Han Taiwanese (GAD1) and Russian (GAD2) ancestry. The present study examined the association of the two GAD isoforms with AD and relevant alcohol-related traits in the Irish Affected Sib Pair Study of Alcohol Dependence [Prescott, C.A., Sullivan, P.F., Myers, J.M., Patterson, D.G., Devitt, M., Halberstadt, L.J., Walsh, D., Kendler, K.S., 2005. The Irish Affected Sib Pair Study of Alcohol Dependence: study methodology and validation of diagnosis by interview and family history. Alcohol.-Clin. Exp. Res. 29 (3) 417-429].


METHODS
Participants were recruited in Ireland, including 575 independent cases who met DSM-IV AD criteria and 530 controls, screened for heavy drinking. We first conducted case-control analyses of the GAD genes with AD and, within the cases, examined associations with age at onset of AD, withdrawal symptoms, and two quantitative measures: initial sensitivity and tolerance (based on scales from the Self-Rating of the Effects of Ethanol) [Schuckit, M.A., Smith, T.L., Tipp, J.E., 1997. The self-rating of the effects of alcohol (SRE) form as a retrospective measure of the risk for alcoholism. Addiction 92, 979-988]. A total of 29 SNPs were genotyped for GAD1 and GAD2 using the Illumina GoldenGate protocols. Statistical procedures were implemented to control for false discovery rates (FDR).


RESULTS
Nine of 29 markers with minor allele frequencies less than 0.01 were removed from standard analysis; the remaining 20 markers were all in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Three markers in the intronic regions of GAD1 were associated with initial sensitivity to alcohol (P=0.002); the associations remained significant after a FDR based correction for multiple testing. In addition, one marker located 3kb upstream of GAD1 exhibited association with age at onset of AD (P=0.0001). Gender specific effects were observed in results of both single marker and haplotype analyses.


CONCLUSION
We found no evidence for the association of GAD genes with AD but significant association of GAD1 with initial sensitivity and age at onset of AD. Our findings suggest that the underlying pathophysiology regulated by genes like GAD1 may be more directly related to the component processes that form AD than to the clinical disorder.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Po-Hsiu Kuo"", ids = ""145734798""); list(name = ""Gursharan Kalsi"", ids = ""46621048""); list(name = ""Carol A Prescott"", ids = ""31251036""); list(name = ""Colin Hodgkinson"", ids = ""2569943""); list(name = ""David Goldman"", ids = ""144059425""); list(name = ""Jeffry Alexander"", ids = ""38412495""); list(name = ""Edwin J.C.G. van den Oord"", ids = ""1763026""); list(name = ""Xiangning Chen"", ids = ""1969414""); list(name = ""Patrick F.

92e117c90263b93f426e5f1a098daac1228eface,Complexity in the genetic architecture of leukoaraiosis in hypertensive sibships from the GENOA Study,"BackgroundSubcortical white matter hyperintensity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, referred to as leukoaraiosis, is associated with increased risk of stroke and dementia. Hypertension may contribute to leukoaraiosis by accelerating the process of arteriosclerosis involving penetrating small arteries and arterioles in the brain. Leukoaraiosis volume is highly heritable but shows significant inter-individual variability that is not predicted well by any clinical covariates (except for age) or by single SNPs.MethodsAs part of the Genetics of Microangiopathic Brain Injury (GMBI) Study, 777 individuals (74% hypertensive) underwent brain MRI and were genotyped for 1649 SNPs from genes known or hypothesized to be involved in arteriosclerosis and related pathways. We examined SNP main effects, epistatic (gene-gene) interactions, and context-dependent (gene-environment) interactions between these SNPs and covariates (including conventional and novel risk factors for arteriosclerosis) for association with leukoaraiosis volume. Three methods were used to reduce the chance of false positive associations: 1) false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple testing, 2) an internal replication design, and 3) a ten-iteration four-fold cross-validation scheme.ResultsFour SNP main effects (in F3, KITLG, CAPN10, and MMP2), 12 SNP-covariate interactions (including interactions between KITLG and homocysteine, and between TGFB3 and both physical activity and C-reactive protein), and 173 SNP-SNP interactions were significant, replicated, and cross-validated. While a model containing the top single SNPs with main effects predicted only 3.72% of variation in leukoaraiosis in independent test samples, a multiple variable model that included the four most highly predictive SNP-SNP and SNP-covariate interactions predicted 11.83%.ConclusionThese results indicate that the genetic architecture of leukoaraiosis is complex, yet predictive, when the contributions of SNP main effects are considered in combination with effects of SNP interactions with other genes and covariates.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jennifer A.

Approximately 50% of HLA class I alleles are shared between Japanese and Caucasians. The analysis of HLA-associated polymorphism (HLA-AP) in both Japanese and Caucasian infected with clade B virus is expected to clarify the difference of HIV-1 evolution between both populations. 
 
Methods: We sequenced Gag, Pol, and Nef genes in 430 treatment-naive Japanese chronically infected with HIV-1 clade B and then identified HLA-associated amino acids at each codon using a phylogenetically corrected logistic regression model and false discovery rates to correct for multiple tests. 
 
Results: We completely determined 400, 366, and 309 sequences of Gag, Pol, and Nef, respectively, and then analyzed polymorphisms associated with 78 four-digit HLA alleles (21 HLA-A, 38 HLA-B, and 19 HLA-C alleles). At the threshold of q<0.2, we found 195 HLA-APs (67 in Gag, 61 in Pol, and 67 in Nef). These polymorphisms were observed at 39 of 501 (7.8%) Gag, 42 of 1004 (4.2%) Pol, and 33 of 207 (16.0%) Nef codons. Ninety-six HLA-APs associated with more than one HLA subtype allele were detected in 4-digital HLA allele analysis. Approximately 40% of HLA-APs were associated with HLA alleles predominantly found in Asia. Out of HLA-APs associated with common HLA alleles, approximately 50% were found in Caucasian population (IHAC cohort). 
 
Conclusion: This study demonstrated that only 30% of HLA-APs were shared between Caucasians and Japanese, indicating that the difference in HLA allele distributions resulted in distinct HIV-1 evolution.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Takayuki Chikata"", ids = ""6537156""); list(name = ""J.

A total of 32 individuals participated in this study: 12 depressive disorder patients with SA and 20 healthy controls were included. Resting state FC was investigated between the two groups by region of interest (ROI) to ROI analysis. Then seed to voxel analysis was performed using significant ROIs as a seed. The correlations of significant resting state FC with clinical data were analyzed. The connectivity of anterior division of right parahippocampus-posterior division of left parahippocampus (pPaHCl) and temporooccipital part of right inferior temporal gyrus-right frontal eye field of dorsal attention network (FEFrDAN) were significantly increased, while connectivity of medial frontal cortex (MedFC)-right supplementary motor cortex (SMAr) was significantly decreased in the patients (p-FDR [false discovery rate] <0.05).

acbdb2e4a23b977017af82776729949669c39e3c,Topological reorganization of the default mode network in patients with poststroke depressive symptoms: A resting-state fMRI study.,"OBJECTIVE
This study mapped the topological configuration of the default mode network (DMN) in patients with depressive symptoms after acute ischemic stroke.


METHODS
The study sample comprised 63 patients: 36 with poststroke depressive symptoms (PSD) and 37 without PSD matched according to age, gender and the severity of stroke. PSD was defined by a cutoff of â‰¥ 7 on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine functional connectivity (FC) to reconstruct the DMN. Network based statistics estimated the FC differences of the DMN between the PSD and non-PSD groups. Graph theoretical approaches were used to characterize the topological properties of this network.


RESULTS
The study sample mainly comprised patients with mild to moderate stroke. A widespread hyper-connected configuration of the functional DMN was characterized in PSD group. The orbital frontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, dorsal medial prefrontal and, ventromedial prefrontal corticis, the middle temporal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule were the functional hubs related to PSD. The nodal topology in inferior parietal lobule and superior frontal gyrus, overlapping with dorsal medial prefrontal and, ventromedial prefrontal cortices, tended to be functionally integrated in patients with PSD. After False Discovery Rate correction, no significant difference between the PSD and non-PSD groups was found with respect to the global and nodal metrics of the DMN. However, the correlations between these altered network metrics and severity of PSD were lacking.


LIMITATIONS
The diagnosis of PSD was based on the GDS score rather than established with a structured clinical interview.


CONCLUSIONS
The DMN in PSD was functionally integrated and more specialized in some core hubs such as the inferior parietal lobule and dorsal prefrontal cortex. The configuration of the subnetwork like DMN may be more essential in the pathogenesis of PSD than single stroke lesions.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yan Liang"", ids = ""144648628""); list(name = ""Yong-cheng Yao"", ids = ""11392295""); list(name = ""Lei Zhao"", ids = ""143805731""); list(name = ""Lin Shi"", ids = ""144039420""); list(name = ""Yangkun Chen"", ids = ""1896678""); list(name = ""Vincent C.

e7771d860297eddd85ae298ff557086969207a00,Detection of new protein domains using co-occurrence: application to Plasmodium falciparum,"MOTIVATION
Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proved to be a powerful tool for protein domain identification in newly sequenced organisms. However, numerous domains may be missed in highly divergent proteins. This is the case for Plasmodium falciparum proteins, the main causal agent of human malaria.


RESULTS
We propose a method to improve the sensitivity of HMM domain detection by exploiting the tendency of the domains to appear preferentially with a few other favorite domains in a protein. When sequence information alone is not sufficient to warrant the presence of a particular domain, our method enables its detection on the basis of the presence of other Pfam or InterPro domains. Moreover, a shuffling procedure allows us to estimate the false discovery rate associated with the results. Applied to P. falciparum, our method identifies 585 new Pfam domains (versus the 3683 already known domains in the Pfam database) with an estimated error rate <20%. These new domains provide 387 new Gene Ontology (GO) annotations to the P. falciparum proteome. Analogous and congruent results are obtained when applying the method to related Plasmodium species (P. vivax and P. yoelii).

434023780c8cf907ca4d60b5e3403c7e628f9ff5,An algorithmic enquiry concerning causality,"In many domains we face the problem of determining the underlying causal structure from time-course observations of a system. Whether we have neural spike trains in neuroscience, gene expression levels in systems biology, or stock price movements in finance, we want to determine why these systems behave the way they do. For this purpose we must assess which of the myriad possible causes are significant while aiming to do so with a feasible computational complexity. At the same time, there has been much work in philosophy on what it means for something to be a cause, but comparatively little attention has been paid to how we can identify these causes. Algorithmic approaches from computer science have provided the first steps in this direction, but fail to capture the complex, probabilistic and temporal nature of the relationships we seek. 
This dissertation presents a novel approach to the inference of general (type-level) and singular (token-level) causes. The approach combines philosophical notions of causality with algorithmic approaches built on model checking and statistical techniques for false discovery rate control. By using a probabilistic computation tree logic to describe both cause and effect, we allow for complex relationships and explicit description of the time between cause and effect as well as the probability of this relationship being observed (e.g. â€œa and b until c, causing d in 10â€“20 time unitsâ€). Using these causal formulas and their associated probabilities, we develop a novel measure for the significance of a cause for its effect, thus allowing discovery of those that are statistically interesting, determined using the concepts of multiple hypothesis testing and false discovery control. We develop algorithms for testing these properties in time-series observations and for relating the inferred general relationships to token-level events (described as sequences of observations). Finally, we illustrate these ideas with example data from both neuroscience and finance, comparing the results to those found with other inference methods. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior control of false discovery rates, due to its ability to appropriately represent and infer temporal information.",2010,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Bhubaneswar Mishra"", ids = ""40310180""); list(name = ""Samantha Kleinberg"", ids = ""50779209"")",9e306afac9413be5f18deedc9f98b2472c85270f; 6697debf217f2e465bb6caaf60db2bb80114c22d; e7dd232958d73e414cea53f571a39ac101994b0a,,,,
c7a2b262b4df968e8fb9e4e1f7721e38fbb677b9,Phenotype and Tissue Expression as a Function of Genetic Risk in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,"Genome-wide association studies and replication analyses have identified (n = 5) or replicated (n = 10) DNA variants associated with risk for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in European women. However, the causal gene and underlying mechanism for PCOS risk at these loci have not been determined. We hypothesized that analysis of phenotype, gene expression and metformin response as a function of genotype would identify candidate genes and pathways that could provide insight into the underlying mechanism for risk at these loci. To test the hypothesis, subjects with PCOS (n = 427) diagnosed according to the NIH criteria (< 9 menses per year and clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism) and controls (n = 407) with extensive phenotyping were studied. A subset of subjects (n = 38) underwent a subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy for RNA sequencing and were subsequently treated with metformin for 12 weeks with standardized outcomes measured. Data were analyzed according to genotype at PCOS risk loci and adjusted for the false discovery rate. A gene variant in the THADA locus was associated with response to metformin and metformin was a predicted upstream regulator at the same locus. Genotype at the FSHB locus was associated with LH levels. Genes near the PCOS risk loci demonstrated differences in expression as a function of genotype in adipose including BLK and NEIL2 (GATA4 locus), GLIPR1 and PHLDA1 (KRR1 locus). Based on the phenotypes, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and upstream regulatory and pathway analyses we hypothesize that there are PCOS subtypes. FSHB, FHSR and LHR loci may influence PCOS risk based on their relationship to gonadotropin levels. The THADA, GATA4, ERBB4, SUMO1P1, KRR1 and RAB5B loci appear to confer risk through metabolic mechanisms. The IRF1, SUMO1P1 and KRR1 loci may confer PCOS risk in development. The TOX3 and GATA4 loci appear to be involved in inflammation and its consequences. The data suggest potential PCOS subtypes and point to the need for additional studies to replicate these findings and identify personalized diagnosis and treatment options for PCOS.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Cindy Ta Pau"", ids = ""5015929""); list(name = ""Tim Mosbruger"", ids = ""37539981""); list(name = ""Richa Saxena"", ids = ""144792210""); list(name = ""Corrine K Welt"", ids = ""4896916"")",57f052e0a497b6661f96610882b469755c281fbf; 52b5e5f2884dbd14fe462be3cf03e8bd84f147f2; e1bccbac9ec4d1590b6c2d89ac44d70082e2e65b; 1807bcf7d6be1403aad1cca125f872d3e0caa554; d949964b625cecaace3e92c20b7f1e9f8b0b9231; 0d85c63fdb3a2af8ddd3a9c82088ecd9c47bfd11; 3cccd305983cc0d2da96a9142965d9bf0906486a; 9dfc544efaadf2865070ce594c25a47e93243fb3; d1c13dc00a80e46caeae49d78473bf58b0739943; 7b9a2974f99f2c638d3cf133974a0dde21d9a853,a6df68b2e81043a53810b0ce99994110134e52f8; 83e61946e16423a8815aa1f92fb9b83df8330b5b; ba1c7eb3db556352a2494a78761d33fdde32b7dd; 9cd8bde685ac1041875ad13f5e744b1b23833379; 772f5fca88de0f6f38116d73cc32e23efe780a10; b36017e91007d588ac00a9df6e574430487e2347; 406f2845ee8de02ac8b72069e8a6fe1376c88278; ff8786a8ca6142e49877f4e5a4b531e140ac031c; 94e43e49f4b422ea052279243030e470624952ed; dd1b3a3793619cec8994cc7cca10e6dee656fb7b; 500fc0be87b6c8931a07ca0e2436fa2add619968; eacfd26219c9427cd7bb2205051f0d652ddf8ff3; ee549570e1e566a11c27f187ee33b11c99b67400; 7b0dbefc0445f538a30951da9fc9b405167a9e98; f0c2eda8e0c37cd19a8727e3425ef1877940d5d4; 53b7b63ca85beeae5eda8163c306b3a03a07fba7; abb17f679190df0027cb544ebf13468ccafcc9e6; 09261dfc1d3626d81073f792bf89d9feadd9abd9; 0792322a16c4728e6f3cc1ae30f8c93dc3942409; 085d8f325685ef83b641ee5cd200c605a389ccce; 5800c7a4f0cba22483f2336bf4811619ded7fcf7; d3ebdd64aa62f4d92444aef8e6504b1e04fbe260; 3a56bb6213c44270ee6724afeb95b87a301a19b8; 81a1118913dce860e6807496d1a8727f817db025; df651db65b03b0ce5510e36b503724ac4638b153; 3d6bac3c82ce73f8ed4c9d0bf1547ad276ed8d94; b985c1aea1ad0e1e2438806bde201492c8407371; c40a00f4388da8986b11075774e64bdb005f666b; daef5056ba8077d2ff4007d92e32587f508e0c6e; d11a111c711d8fc5c6ab4b4cbd891013ee26edda; 57fc4698070f55287a7b552776677623aa074483,PLoS ONE,12,

4a94cc5291103349ac75fc64f71a304907435bcf,Abstract P5-13-01: Transcript analysis of PI3K and immune-related genes and gene signatures in the pre- and post-treatment samples from the window of opportunity study of anastrozole and anastrozole with pictilisib (GDC-0941) in patients with HR-positive early breast cancer (OPPORTUNE study),"Background: The OPPORTUNE Study randomized postmenopausal patients (pts) to receive 2-week preoperative treatment with anastrozole (ANA) plus pictilisib (""ANA+PIC"" arm) or ANA alone. Patients had newly diagnosed, operable, ER+, HER2- invasive breast cancer of â‰¥1 cm size. The primary outcome at interim analysis (n=70) revealed that the addition of PIC significantly increased the anti-proliferative response to ANA as measured by reduction in Ki67 immunohistochemistry (IHC). Multivariate analyses suggested benefit of PIC for patients with luminal B disease (Schmid et al. SABCS 2014). Methods : RNA expression analysis of âˆ¼800 breast cancer-related genes was performed on patients analyzed at the interim analysis, including 14 (ANA) and 20 (ANA+PIC) patients with matched pre- and post- treatment paired tumour samples using the nCounter platform (NanoString). Differential expression of individual genes by arm was assessed using paired and moderated t-tests and statistical significance assessed through false discovery rate (FDR). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of differentially expressed transcripts identified pathways of relevance. Protein expression was analyzed by reverse protein array ( RPPA) in pre- and post-treatment samples. Results: In an unsupervised analysis, down-regulation of genes associated with ER signaling was observed in patients who received single-agent ANA and ANA+PIC, which included genes that regulate the cell cycle, cell death, survival, growth and proliferation and known ER target genes (e.g., PGR, GREB1). In addition, transcripts related to growth factor signaling pathway appeared to be specifically modulated in the ANA+PIC arm, possibly via the upregulation of the expression of RTK ligands. There were no clear changes in PI3K-related phosphoproteins (e.g., AKT, S6, 4E-BP1) in the post-treatment samples by RPPA. However, known PI3K-regulated genes, IRS2 and PIK3IP1, were upregulated in the post-treatment samples and a composite PI3K gene expression signature score (O9Brien et al. 2010) was reduced in both study arms following treatment. This PI3K signature was associated with pre-treatment luminal B status (n=27) and, consistent with this finding, the baseline PI3K gene signature score in the ANA arm, but not the ANA+PIC arm, was inversely associated with the decrease in post treatment Ki67. The tumor immune microenvironment was analyzed though the use of composite gene sets. In our initial observations, analysis of pre- and post-treatment samples showed that 2-week treatment with ANA resulted in a modest increase in transcripts associated with multiple immune signatures, which was further enhanced by the addition of PIC. Conclusions : Gene expression analysis of pre- and post-treatment samples in the OPPORTUNE study demonstrates on-target inhibition of ER and PI3K signaling networks. The analysis of additional paired samples is in progress to further assess if 2-weeks of treatment with a regimen containing an AI in patients with early breast cancer impacts the tumor immune microenvironment.

772524697a4580405fc6e82cfee3d56b58314bb5,Detection of Multiple Change Points by the Filtered Derivative and False Discovery Rate,"Let $\mathbf{X}=(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n)$ be a time series, that is a sequence of random variable indexed by the time $ t=1,2,\ldots,n $. We assume the existence of a segmentation $\tau=(\tau_1,\tau_2,\ldots,\tau_n)$ such that $X_i$ is a family of independent identically distributed (i.i.d) random variable for i $\in (\tau_k,\tau_k+1],~and~k=0,\ldots,K$ where by convention $\tau_o$ and $\tau_{K+1}=N$. In the literature, it exist two main kinds of change points detections: The change points on-line and the change points off-line. In this work, we consider only the change point analysis (off-line), when number of change points isÂ  unknown. The result obtainedÂ  is based on Filtered Derivative method whereÂ  we use a second step based on False Discovery Rate. We compare numerically this new method with the Filtered Derivative with p-Value.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Mohamed Elmi"", ids = ""40357945"")",279f6fd38ce3192df64bbfac3b835686ba8f3b6e; 7abcf38e8da2c1af2c7236781fccde3e218b5469; 6b49f50ff0dfbadf90923af90db127ea62fe0e9c,944b1ecbc19d5ebcff51fcb13be99a6c16f1a15c; 71421b7b6ebccebb74420b1c940134c7ff3cdb43; 39acfbf0f43d4ef9ad00dcba51b0dbafe25686cb; ad81652a6c7d211b47565191103fd3e9cf9cf0e4; 34b92fa4dfd83f3d6d0d6c136648fe805f194d09; f6a7601ca7334786a513391674efa4bf8791459e; a482988703f2c5a96fa2b6e2dfe23fc0462cd70f; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 8a4c64020021621aef9979fa3b10e904322a9216; de43716adca5ec855463ab392b24b8098e35ea06; 97719134294b51b626a98b4dbdd7c47288915c2d; 2f4fb1e15f88619c847abd1b3c02fceac00def7e; e0d9b68faccd9ab73b9a51f7dddeed7c73df3fa1; 3cc3ad79037a0ef282fe5b9bdc986fbec31c7ee5; a233d8da4bca83a507086c447000083c26486b4b; a16d2830aee2e47214851a19d9838c11d07b0cbf; 216c79c01c093ebaf1e67f3fecfbb15b60b641a4,International Journal of Statistics and Probability,3,12

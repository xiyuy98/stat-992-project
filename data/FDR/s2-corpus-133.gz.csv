10dd18c6a128a3c064bfd2b4f69fac63ce61027c,Molecular signatures generated with RNA Isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens differentiate metastatic and non-metastatic primary breast cancer.,"614 Background: Breast cancer can be either non-metastatic (locally-advanced) or metastatic, with the latter giving rise to a considerably worse prognosis. Because tissue from patients is generally available only as FFPE specimens, we investigated whether distinct molecular ""signatures"" could be obtained for these breast cancer types using RNA isolated from archival FFPE specimen blocks in gene expression arrays.


METHODS
FFPE specimens were available from 15 non-metastatic tumors and 12 primary tumors along with their matching metastases. Up to 5 10-micron sections of each were microdissected to isolate areas of tumor tissue. RNA was extracted using a proprietary procedure of Response Genetics, Inc. and was then amplified and labeled. The resulting cRNA was hybridized to the U133 plus 2.0 GeneChip. An unsupervised PCA analysis of the samples resulted in the first principal component separating 2 distinct groups which consisted of the non-metastatic and metastatic tumors. A differentially expressed gene list between metastatic and non-metastatic CRC was determined. These data were also analyzed for differential canonical pathways using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.


RESULTS
Hierarchical clustering analysis segregated locallyadvanced primary tumors and metastatic primary tumors intotwo clusters with distinct gene signatures. A T-test with unequal variance assumption identified 1595 differentially expressed probe sets with FDR (false discovery rate) = 0.005 (p=0.00015). However, comparison of primary tumors with their liver metastases using a paired T-test showed only 18 differentially expressed probe sets at FDR=0.05 and 1019 genes with significance p value â‰¤ 0.005. Pathway analysis showed significant deregulation of FGF signaling, G2/M DNA damage cell cycle checkpoint, IL-2, IL-4 and EGF signaling between locally advanced and metastatic primary tumors.


CONCLUSION
We have demonstrated the feasibility of identifying metastatic and non-metastatic tumors by microarray analysis using FFPE breast cancer tissue. This result is currently being validated in a separate larger cohort of patients.

278248e833f18ab44924f513eb730c01a62c286e,Demographically-Based Evaluation of Genomic Regions under Selection in Domestic Dogs,"Controlling for background demographic effects is important for accurately identifying loci that have recently undergone positive selection. To date, the effects of demography have not yet been explicitly considered when identifying loci under selection during dog domestication. To investigate positive selection on the dog lineage early in the domestication, we examined patterns of polymorphism in six canid genomes that were previously used to infer a demographic model of dog domestication. Using an inferred demographic model, we computed false discovery rates (FDR) and identified 349 outlier regions consistent with positive selection at a low FDR. The signals in the top 100 regions were frequently centered on candidate genes related to brain function and behavior, including LHFPL3, CADM2, GRIK3, SH3GL2, MBP, PDE7B, NTAN1, and GLRA1. These regions contained significant enrichments in behavioral ontology categories. The 3rd top hit, CCRN4L, plays a major role in lipid metabolism, that is supported by additional metabolism related candidates revealed in our scan, including SCP2D1 and PDXC1. Comparing our method to an empirical outlier approach that does not directly account for demography, we found only modest overlaps between the two methods, with 60% of empirical outliers having no overlap with our demography-based outlier detection approach. Demography-aware approaches have lower-rates of false discovery. Our top candidates for selection, in addition to expanding the set of neurobehavioral candidate genes, include genes related to lipid metabolism, suggesting a dietary target of selection that was important during the period when proto-dogs hunted and fed alongside hunter-gatherers.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Adam H.

fadff1ac21109f1caf36e53353f7faa993ba2f02,"Association of GSTP1, COMT, and TPMT with testicular cancer (TC) treatment outcome after cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CBCT).","344 Background: Genetic variation in GSTP1, COMT, and TPMT, which are genes important to the metabolism of cisplatin, may affect TC treatment outcome. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of these genes causing increased cisplatin metabolism may be associated with worse treatment outcome.


METHODS
TC patients who had CBCT, â‰¥ 1 year of follow-up since initiation of CBCT, and genotyping completed as part of a genome-wide association study were included. After excluding markers with genotyping call rates of < 90%, we analyzed 3, 43, and 44 SNPs each for GSTP1, COMT, and TPMT respectively. We evaluated three endpoints: refractory disease (RD) as defined by radiographic or serologic evidence of TC after initial CBCT; progression-free survival (PFS); and overall survival (OS). We studied SNP association with these endpoints assuming additive, recessive, and dominant genetic models and adjusted p-values for false discovery rate to account for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
137 patients (82.5% white, median age of 31 years) were recruited. Among them, 81.7% had non-seminoma and 68.6%, 8.0% and 22.6% were in good, intermediate, and poor IGCCC prognostic group respectively. 33.6%, 62.0%, 0.7%, and 2.9% had EP, BEP, TIP, and VIP respectively as initial CBCT with a mean total cisplatin dose of 345.3 mg/m2. After initial CBCT, 8.0% developed RD; among the remaining 92.0%, 23.8% had recurrent TC after a mean follow-up of 46.8 months. We found no statistically significant associations of our SNPs with PFS or OS. However, the COMT rs2073743 G allele conferred a higher risk of RF. It was present in 40.9% of patients with RD versus 21.1% of those without. Assuming recessive inheritance, patients with rs2073743 GG had over 20-fold increased odds (odds ratio = 22.69, (95% CI 3.3 - 155.8) ) of RD compared to those who carry at least one C allele. After adjusting for race, IGCCC, primary site of disease, type of CBCT, and total cisplatin dose, this association was no longer statistically significant.


CONCLUSIONS
COMT rs2073743 may be associated with RD, but replication and validation studies will be imperative to confirm this finding.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chunkit Fung"", ids = ""22144437""); list(name = ""David J.

4f9dd93bee1ae2b24b0120d1fdafcffbc6a08907,Effective QTL Discovery Incorporating Genomic Annotations,"Mapping molecular QTLs has emerged as an important tool for understanding the genetic basis of cell functions. With the increasing availability of functional genomic data, it is natural to incorporate genomic annotations into QTL discovery. In this paper, we describe a novel method, named TORUS, for integrative QTL discovery. Using hierarchical modeling, our approach embeds a rigorous enrichment analysis to quantify the enrichment level of each annotation in target QTLs. This enrichment information is then used to identify QTLs by up-weighting the genetic variants with relevant annotations using a Bayesian false discovery rate control procedure. Our proposed method only requires summary-level statistics and is highly efficient computationally: it runs one-hundred times faster than the current gold-standard QTL discovery approach that relies on permutations. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed method performs accurate enrichment analysis and controls the desired type I error rate while greatly improving the power of QTL discovery when incorporating informative annotations. Finally, we analyze the recently released expression-genotype data from 44 human tissues generated by the GTEx project. By integrating the simple annotation of SNP distance to transcription start sites, we discover more genes that harbor expression-associated SNPs in all 44 tissues, with an average increase of 1,485 genes.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Xiaoquan Wen"", ids = ""36836750"")",7c392d2bb94834b282361d009ce02e6f5e202767; d3ec33be99af74612a53bd36cae273125f8fa727,f67da5d6d22493b779c5800b02c2fca64c50972b; 8cddedb17eeb70171a8d58c4eb0582e84e347066; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 5b3841e147e3196f14e2f6212bd95398d6190224; a2e5cb4898ff903d425f096ecf9a82074a855c9b; 310e6a925850a80ccc5c29f813c71f666a14fa39; fd89721f007f62d52cbc3ac329aa5e36a6e0f8d9; a771dee848037eaf2236c68cddf6c7d2993bb424; fd3e0a65096ebb7ae301cd9e3ccc6ac7fee1111e; 0a41e54688c618973c897c1a9cb22a02b5d3ced5; 092ef7909a3f877b74dca1972670ad56f0ed8461; aebf1d0dce345b39b78cbdef663922a2a7546567; b088e0beee73075d4ebcc35469df4b67b70e51f5; d1f2d78bf551b97e4c6e0a522d40ce837265c683; b5f109c8d49a95f72313aff41cf8a0b2e8e1407a; 4d71d6d4d6d485f68d523d6a45ab2ae742ba5e57; cd90714a9928827e81a18f0c1516813a78e9df94; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; 328ffc2e64c790a9467503c3ba37cca3f9ab66a7; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 03be636697c84eb22114f09de6c1bea215cc87c8; 18c41713e2d4c5748136ee57b071ff0eb27c0a8a; 9d24d45821ff8940739850ce962e36c876e0341d; 3d6751b1be76dbdd0a3e65eb45e973bb8d2c4376; 014e00653edf178bd44a220436c4646433482046; 92084e60ead2863038a9d8508da6e6898def0d14; 977a61f5b31aef34499caae9da079d79dc1d13a2; 248b702476d53e59c50c3cc55193ee15b750058e; 31eb8d8c0e6691f77bea7b340879b0fbab45fb30,bioRxiv,,

Models generated with each method are compared against a ground truth model to assess performance at variable selection and coefficient estimation. We also assess the theoretical impacts of different modeling choices. Results show that the ANOVA procedure has a significantly lower false discovery rate than stepwise regression, whereas Bayesian methods exhibit higher true positive rates and comparable false discovery rates to ANOVA. Bayesian methods also generate coefficient estimates with less bias and variance than either stepwise regression or ANOVA.

To understand the relation between risk genes for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their influence on biomarkers for AD, we examined the association of AD in the Finnish cohort with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from top AlzGene loci, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and candidate gene studies; and tested the correlation between these SNPs and AD markers AÎ²(1-42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).


METHODS
We tested 25 SNPs for genetic association with clinical AD in our cohort comprised of 890 AD patients and 701-age matched healthy controls using logistic regression. For the correlational study with biomarkers, we tested 36 SNPs in a subset of 222 AD patients with available CSF using mixed models. Statistical analyses were adjusted for age, gender and APOE status. False discovery rate for multiple testing was applied. All participants were from academic hospital and research institutions in Finland.


RESULTS
APOE-Îµ4, CLU rs11136000, and MS4A4A rs2304933 correlated with significantly decreased AÎ²(1-42) (corrected p<0.05). At an uncorrected p<0.05, PPP3R1 rs1868402 and MAPT rs2435211 were related with increased t-tau; while SORL1 rs73595277 and MAPT rs16940758, with increased p-tau. Only TOMM40 rs2075650 showed association with clinical AD after adjusting for APOE-Îµ4 (p = 0.007), but not after multiple test correction (p>0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
We provide evidence that APOE-Îµ4, CLU and MS4A4A, which have been identified in GWAS to be associated with AD, also significantly reduced CSF AÎ²1-42 in AD. None of the other AlzGene and GWAS loci showed significant effects on CSF tau. The effects of other SNPs on CSF biomarkers and clinical AD diagnosis did not reach statistical significance. Our findings suggest that APOE-Îµ4, CLU and MS4A4A influence both AD risk and CSF AÎ²1-42.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lyzel S.

56ef922ded9faab5632d690bfa3ffd5f5db331d6,Gene profiling in transurethral resection samples of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC).,"4641 Background: Patients with metastatic carcinoma of the prostate (CaP) develop after a mean of 15 months resistance to hormone ablation therapy. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown. Our goal was to identify the transcriptional changes that are characteristic for the transition to hormone resistant prostate cancer (HRPC) using oligonucleotide microarrays. Here, we report the attempt to profile fresh frozen tissue obtained by palliative transurethral resection (TUR) in patients with HRPC and concomittant urinary obstruction.


METHODS
Indications for palliative TUR were locally progressive tumors with obstruction and voiding problems. HRPC was defined according to the criteria of Scher et al. 1995. Samples of 8 HRPC patients were compared to tissues from 8 hormone-sensitive CaP patients including biological and technical replicates. All tissue samples had been pathologically evaluated. Only macrodissected prostate samples with at least 70% tumor content were used for RNA extraction. RNA quality was controlled using the Bioanalyzer Nanochip (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto). Expression analysis was performed on Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays.


RESULTS
We identified 323 genes being significantly deregulated (corrected p-value <0.05, false discovery rate <0.05). These genes were mapped to cellular pathways using the KEGG annotation and the most significantly deregulated pathways were identified. Deregulation of metabolic pathways included fatty acid metabolism as well as oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis. Cell cycle control seems to be further suppressed by the downregulation of JNK-pathway via MEKK4 and JUND, the downregulation of p21 (CDKN1A) and the induction of Cylcin D1. We also present evidence for a significant downregulation of actin cyctoskeleton components. Deregulated genes likely to be specific for the transition from prostate carcinoma to HRPC will be presented.


CONCLUSIONS
Gene expression profiling has been successfully standardised using fresh TUR material of HRPC patients. Deregulated genes have been mapped to specific signal transduction pathways. On this platform, clinical trials in patients with HRPC using specific inhibitors of cell signalling are being developed.

821a10ae009a968917dff335b719d6b5518962b6,Hybridization and amplification rate correction for,"Background: Copy number variation (CNV) is essential to understand the pathology of many complex diseases at the DNA level. Affymetrix SNP arrays, which are widely used for CNV studies, significantly depend on accurate copy number (CN) estimation. Nevertheless, CN estimation may be biased by several factors, including cross-hybridization and training sample batch, as well as genomic waves of intensities induced by sequence-dependent hybridization rate and amplification efficiency. Since many available algorithms only address one or two of the three factors, a high false discovery rate (FDR) often results when identifying CNV. Therefore, we have developed a new CNV detection pipeline which is based on hybridization and amplification rate correction (CNVhac). Methods: CNVhac first estimates the allelic concentrations (ACs) of target sequences by using the sample independent parameters trained through physicochemical hybridization law. Then the raw CN is estimated by taking the ratio of AC to the corresponding average AC from a reference sample set for one specific site. Finally, a hidden Markov model (HMM) segmentation process is implemented to detect CNV regions. Results: Based on public HapMap data, the results show that CNVhac effectively smoothes the genomic waves and facilitates more accurate raw CN estimates compared to other methods. Moreover, CNVhac alleviates, to a certain extent, the sample dependence of inference and makes CNV calling with appreciable low FDRs. Conclusion: CNVhac is an effective approach to address the common difficulties in SNP array analysis, and the working principles of CNVhac can be easily extended to other platforms.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Quan Wang"", ids = ""144788663""); list(name = ""Peichao Peng"", ids = ""38401610""); list(name = ""Minping Qian"", ids = ""144655405""); list(name = ""Lin Wan"", ids = ""144363231""); list(name = ""Minghua Deng"", ids = ""1709706"")",,,,,

After briefly reviewing the CUSUM and Shiryayev-Roberts (SR) procedures for a single sequence under an exponential family model, we propose a combined CUSUM-SR procedure that is locally optimal in terms of the delay detection time. The design based on the Average In-control Run Length and comparisons with other procedures are discussed. After a common change is detected, a classifier formed by the post-change parameter estimations is used to isolate the possible candidates for the changed panels, that are then used to estimate the common change-point. To reduce the false discovery rate (FDR), supplementary runs are proposed.

75ea7c8aa355f5f373bf7dba1aab6ab934593eae,Prospective metabolomics study identifies potential novel blood metabolites associated with pancreatic cancer risk.,"Using a metabolomics approach, we systematically searched for circulating metabolite biomarkers for pancreatic cancer risk in a case-control study nested within two prospective Shanghai cohorts. Included in our study were 226 incident pancreatic cancer cases and their individually-matched controls. Untargeted mass spectrometry platforms were used to measure metabolites in blood samples collected prior to cancer diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression was performed to assess the associations of metabolites with pancreatic cancer risk. We identified 10 metabolites associated with pancreatic cancer, after accounting for multiple comparisons (the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate <0.05). The majority of the identified metabolites were glycerophospholipids (ORs per SD increase: 0.44-2.32; p values: 7.2Â Ã—Â 10-4 to 1.0Â Ã—Â 10-6 ), six of which were associated with decreased risk and one with increased risk. Additionally, levels of coumarin (ORÂ =Â 1.96, pÂ =Â 3.7Â Ã—Â 10-6 ) and picolinic acid (ORÂ =Â 2.53, pÂ =Â 5.0Â Ã—Â 10-5 ) were positively associated with pancreatic cancer risk, while tetracosanoic acid was inversely associated with risk (ORÂ =Â 0.48, pÂ =Â 7.16Â Ã—Â 10-7 ). Four metabolites remained statistically significant after mutual adjustment. Our study provides novel evidence that the dysregulation of glycerophospholipids may play an important role in pancreatic cancer development.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiang Shu"", ids = ""48207158""); list(name = ""Wei Zheng"", ids = ""48499811""); list(name = ""Danxia Yu"", ids = ""6116094""); list(name = ""Hong-Lan Li"", ids = ""4541302""); list(name = ""Qing Lan"", ids = ""2359692""); list(name = ""Gong Yang"", ids = ""145559577""); list(name = ""Hui Cai"", ids = ""145928310""); list(name = ""Xiao peng Ma"", ids = ""144433759""); list(name = ""Nathaniel Rothman"", ids = ""144639248""); list(name = ""Yu-tang Gao"", ids = ""48146752""); list(name = ""Wei Jia"", ids = ""145229527""); list(name = ""Yong-Bing Xiang"", ids = ""145096382""); list(name = ""Xiao-Ou Shu"", ids = ""2363552"")",1512a93aad1880d1eb896bc5cb9f21186545adeb; ee91476d1c76fc314e962f6a68b0a8efb511a3c7,,International journal of cancer,143 9,"

1447abde68017e50953b3a93c9cc36e17343a621,Denoising functional MR images: a comparison of wavelet denoising and Gaussian smoothing,"We present a general wavelet-based denoising scheme for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and compare it to Gaussian smoothing, the traditional denoising method used in fMRI analysis. One-dimensional WaveLab thresholding routines were adapted to two-dimensional (2-D) images, and applied to 2-D wavelet coefficients. To test the effect of these methods on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we compared the SNR of 2-D fMRI images before and after denoising, using both Gaussian smoothing and wavelet-based methods. We simulated a fMRI series with a time signal in an active spot, and tested the methods on noisy copies of it. The denoising methods were evaluated in two ways: by the average temporal SNR inside the original activated spot, and by the shape of the spot detected by thresholding the temporal SNR maps. Denoising methods that introduce much smoothness are better suited for low SNRs, but for images of reasonable quality they are not preferable, because they introduce heavy deformations. Wavelet-based denoising methods that introduce less smoothing preserve the sharpness of the images and retain the original shapes of active regions. We also performed statistical parametric mapping on the denoised simulated time series, as well as on a real fMRI data set. False discovery rate control was used to correct for multiple comparisons. The results show that the methods that produce smooth images introduce more false positives. The less smoothing wavelet-based methods, although generating more false negatives, produce a smaller total number of errors than Gaussian smoothing or wavelet-based methods with a large smoothing effect.",2004,Mathematics; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Alle Meije Wink"", ids = ""2552919""); list(name = ""Jos B.

f7a5931e560d5210fc6a67c12ea1f20ccf040d23,Genome-wide association study for the level of serum electrolytes inÂ Italian Large White pigs.,"Calcium, magnesium and phosphorus are essential electrolytes involved in a large number of biological processes. Imbalance of these minerals in blood may indicate clinically relevant conditions and are important in inferring acute or chronic pathologies in humans and animals. In this work, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the level of these three electrolytes in the serum of 843 performance-tested Italian Large White pigs. All pigs were genotyped with the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip, and GWAS was carried out using genome-wide efficient mixed-model association. For the level of Ca(2+) , eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were significant, considering a false discovery rate (FDR) <Â 0.05, and another eight were above the moderate association threshold (Pnominal value Â <Â 5.00E-05). These SNPs are distributed in four porcine chromosomes (SSC): SSC8, SSC11, SSC12 and SSC13. In particular, a few putative different signals of association detected on SSC13 and one on SSC12 were in genes or close to genes involved in calcium metabolism (P2RY1, RAP2B, SLC9A9, C3orf58, TSC22D2, PLCH1 and CACNB1). Only one SNP (on SSC7) and six SNPs (on SSC2 and SSC7) showed moderate association with the level of magnesium and phosphorus respectively. The association signals for these two latter minerals might identify genes not known thus far for playing a role in their biological functions and regulations. In conclusion, our GWAS contributed to increased knowledge on the role that calcium, magnesium and phosphorus may play in the genetically determined physiological mechanisms affecting the natural variability of mineral levels in mammalian blood.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Samuele Bovo"", ids = ""7512184""); list(name = ""Giuseppina Schiavo"", ids = ""49109718""); list(name = ""G Mazzoni"", ids = ""20772711""); list(name = ""Stefania Dall'Olio"", ids = ""7732621""); list(name = ""G.

d9f3848f4dee2e86dbaef06878021e6ebb4da9d7,Disrupted hypothalamic functional connectivity in patients with PD and autonomic dysfunction,"Objective To test whether symptoms of autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson disease (PD) are associated with alterations in intrinsic hypothalamic functional connectivity, given the regulatory role of the hypothalamus (HTH) in the autonomic nervous system. Methods Resting-state fMRI scans from patients with PD were analyzed, comparing patients with the highest (n = 24) and lowest (n = 28) quartile scores in a questionnaire assessing autonomic dysfunction in PD (Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Diseaseâ€“Autonomic [SCOPA-AUT]), obtained from a larger pool of patients (n = 93). Higher scores on the SCOPA-AUT indicate more severe symptoms. Seed-based functional connectivity maps, based on a seed region in the left and right HTH, were computed for each patient and compared by use of a general linear model, with false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons. Partial correlation tests were additionally performed to test whether the associations between SCOPA-AUT scores and hypothalamic functional connectivity were independent of motor dysfunction, disease duration, cognitive function, and age. Results Relative to patients with PD with lower SCOPA-AUT scores, patients with higher scores displayed significantly reduced functional connectivity between the HTH and the striatum (caudate, putamen) and thalamus. The significant association between striato-thalamo-hypothalamic functional connectivity and SCOPA-AUT scores was retained after controlling for each patient's corresponding Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores, age, disease duration, and cognitive function. Conclusions Patients with PD with symptoms of autonomic dysfunction show disrupted thalamo-striato-hypothalamic functional connectivity independently of overall motor dysfunction, disease duration, age and cognitive function. These findings suggest that symptoms of autonomic dysfunction in PD are accompanied by central deficits in the neural circuits that regulate autonomic function and their interaction with the basal ganglia.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eran Dayan"", ids = ""2156490""); list(name = ""Miriam Sklerov"", ids = ""50637469""); list(name = ""Nina M Browner"", ids = ""6953252"")",18ed5ae2d6d8c9e00d5656380ebeacb6c4c83e67; be4cfd5942112f0fc7f9717f66854d476f023f66; ee6ad6fb0e68684539ead99ad4a3a8b39333cff2; 91b74e5edafd96a7df43139847b2e3baf9460786; d7f3ae375fe4057af0ee0fb513aa0336f8ece64f; aa085450a32f137163831e58cc74383d8e5c6091; 552d40290f7106419c43502f2531294a405ebaf7; 1c7f4a43ea65e3118a6c69417a87f0380f025a26; 3606744ffe9ac8172b8e1cc32d6327fbbf315396; 43b21d4ebd8d6adc9d07448645d1c33a13c1661a; df2770c3d7a2136a4bb0cf0fa32255fd0d697bb9; ba7366d15354310429e37ca98bdd292476637864,e24dfc1c028076c282f6d6b1408f987fd3f199a2; 1d51376fb7ca01b1819c58dc022d34324c673143; fabf95041ff3debdd703c941021df8c27b8b3b69; 797ce283ef74302cec35c103f328256766f9ad08; 4c790c71219f6be248a3d426347bf7c4e3a0a6c4; de9342c352f428868118787c075f09e1f3009615; c488e24113804e5a1310ad5250a1a212189d2c53; 70a7290587e5326f9ddcdfe48a772ae09d028c93; eabc311b405d95109e745ed040fe9042e966064e; aeff2ee3d38725099e972f713babcb96ae06013d; 81ab1992b48a33099b3fa7a7f514bdaaac1e0b5e; f4ba10a7e6617225a9f410d5a3c708eb0d272d37; c17b1e8b3bfea4cfaa1414a853d31b9d3e50c6fc; 13bfdf45f347869eaeab73b80902a0c41f5913c2; dc0bb61da39a6a1978a93648397d04ddc10cc62c; 7e5a358029e3f89f335de4049d0dccb1bc166d05; 548c505742f186359837da72bb81296253b527b3; 80ee7c8a1cf94dfbbec90839979ee707d23e7296; 39b68a04d422c8123c3459dbc23043217e8e13ed; f97a9a89062b0fcd6a6b42e0ea0f64e759cf289d; 4e40c6b221bdedd76bab74870853a5fbe9e01bd6; c32229d8ca90a34b6a903567b35db6c1f5ee4796; 38247fd51ba1df5cd9095e676b2be37bfe0d5fee; f505e2918650ef2f38f30ac75871799752f906ba; d72760a9381873a070ff09679308421dc75b9f88; 6040d380b06387a3c3b8b693c25c6596693789f5; 9f2f6d98a9d566704543d88da16c1cffde8e6818; 16c80c4105fc795d0cf43854d8a61535730d73e2; e745d0867371696d515afaf1eea0fe1d60b4ca64; 231d70b3c433750f95cdfe0e31b85197c4120aa2; b3b2a75ad0958fecba9eb164719e65bd8bbc7073; 0f2d2cafdd068fabe7b51ea9b64371431b416f0d; 5d7e514d45141178fc1061bd18f1102d8318a8c3; 074a098e6674905b4bfbc6c0ee5a33f8b2a6c4f7; bdd62e628b9029d98baacbb9e9ce16a9b70f5719; 09682d5c8557265327cc173a8868beeb44ded8f5; 1cfa2eae63684cbb0d8ffd5e1b243cb0937c222b; 29131db3c9879cf36241c46f1f591b9e8783367f,Neurology,90,e2051â€“e2058
5a547ebb90a62e88607c05ba98d497f074cea7ee,"Integration of Genome-Wide Computation DRE Search, AhR ChIP-chip and Gene Expression Analyses of TCDD-Elicited Responses in the Mouse Liver","BackgroundThe aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor (TF) that mediates responses to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Integration of TCDD-induced genome-wide AhR enrichment, differential gene expression and computational dioxin response element (DRE) analyses further elucidate the hepatic AhR regulatory network.ResultsGlobal ChIP-chip and gene expression analyses were performed on hepatic tissue from immature ovariectomized mice orally gavaged with 30 Î¼g/kg TCDD. ChIP-chip analysis identified 14,446 and 974 AhR enriched regions (1% false discovery rate) at 2 and 24 hrs, respectively. Enrichment density was greatest in the proximal promoter, and more specifically, within Â± 1.5 kb of a transcriptional start site (TSS). AhR enrichment also occurred distal to a TSS (e.g. intergenic DNA and 3' UTR), extending the potential gene expression regulatory roles of the AhR. Although TF binding site analyses identified over-represented DRE sequences within enriched regions, approximately 50% of all AhR enriched regions lacked a DRE core (5'-GCGTG-3'). Microarray analysis identified 1,896 number of TCDD-responsive genes (|fold change| â‰¥ 1.5, P1(t) > 0.999). Integrating this gene expression data with our ChIP-chip and DRE analyses only identified 625 differentially expressed genes that involved an AhR interaction at a DRE. Functional annotation analysis of differentially regulated genes associated with AhR enrichment identified overrepresented processes related to fatty acid and lipid metabolism and transport, and xenobiotic metabolism, which are consistent with TCDD-elicited steatosis in the mouse liver.ConclusionsDetails of the AhR regulatory network have been expanded to include AhR-DNA interactions within intragenic and intergenic genomic regions. Moreover, the AhR can interact with DNA independent of a DRE core suggesting there are alternative mechanisms of AhR-mediated gene regulation.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Edward Dere"", ids = ""144241841""); list(name = ""Raymond Chun Hing Lo"", ids = ""1739349""); list(name = ""Trine Celius"", ids = ""4010834""); list(name = ""Jason Matthews"", ids = ""144619582""); list(name = ""Timothy R.

03428a22201ae7eb1df627e509b2fcc0df1b18e9,The false discovery rate: a key concept in large-scale genetic studies.,"BACKGROUND
In experimental research, a statistical test is often used for making decisions on a null hypothesis such as that the means of gene expression in the normal and tumor groups are equal. Typically, a test statistic and its corresponding P value are calculated to measure the extent of the difference between the two groups. The null hypothesis is rejected and a discovery is declared when the P value is less than a prespecified significance level. When more than one test is conducted, use of a significance level intended for use by a single test typically leads to a large chance of false-positive findings.


METHODS
This paper presents an overview of the multiple testing framework and describes the false discovery rate (FDR) approach to determining the significance cutoff when a large number of tests are conducted.


RESULTS
The FDR is the expected proportion of the null hypotheses that are falsely rejected divided by the total number of rejections. An FDR-controlling procedure is described and illustrated with a numerical example.


CONCLUSIONS
In multiple testing, a classical ""family-wise error rate"" (FWE) approach is commonly used when the number of tests is small. When a study involves a large number of tests, the FDR error measure is a more useful approach to determining a significance cutoff, as the FWE approach is too stringent. The FDR approach allows more claims of significant differences to be made, provided the investigator is willing to accept a small fraction of false-positive findings.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""James J.

7009cba5c851ad9eff8e23f6fa9eaccf6e6c1d03,A SAS Macro for Calculating New Methods of Error Control in Multiple Hypothesis Testing,"The testing of multiple null hypotheses in a single study is a common occurrence in applied research. The problem of Type I error inflation or probability pyramiding in such contexts has been well-known for many years. General procedures for the control of Type I error rates in multiple testing are the Bonferroni procedure and itsâ€™ more recent modifications. These procedures partition a desired level of Familywise error across the set of hypotheses being tested. Recent work on multiple testing by Benjamini and Hochberg (1993, 1995, 2000) has focused on controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) rather than rates of Type I error. The adaptive (BH-A) and nonadaptive (BH) procedures for controlling the FDR in a set of tests promise increases in statistical power relative to other procedures. This paper presents a SAS macro that calculates probabilities under five decision rules that may be used in multiple testing (per hypothesis rule, Bonferroni, Hochberg, BH, BH-A) The macro evaluates a set of probabilities that are supplied as an input. Macro outputs include the results of the five decision rules applied to the set of probabilities. The paper provides a demonstration of the SAS/IML code and examples of the application of the code in simulation studies.",2002,,"list(name = ""Jeffrey D.

7079e0caa5809d6797c15cf5e3f17d2ea9da6c73,Leveraging genome characteristics to improve gene discovery for putamen subcortical brain structure,"Discovering genetic variants associated with human brain structures is an on-going effort. The ENIGMA consortium conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with standard multi-study analytical methodology and identified several significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here we employ a novel analytical approach that incorporates functional genome annotations (e.g., exon or 5â€²UTR), total linkage disequilibrium (LD) scores and heterozygosity to construct enrichment scores for improved identification of relevant SNPs. The method provides increased power to detect associated SNPs by estimating stratum-specific false discovery rate (FDR), where strata are classified according to enrichment scores. Applying this approach to the GWAS summary statistics of putamen volume in the ENIGMA cohort, a total of 15 independent significant SNPs were identified (conditional FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05). In contrast, 4 SNPs were found based on standard GWAS analysis (Pâ€‰<â€‰5 Ã— 10âˆ’8). These 11 novel loci include GATAD2B, ASCC3, DSCAML1, and HELZ, which are previously implicated in various neural related phenotypes. The current findings demonstrate the boost in power with the annotation-informed FDR method, and provide insight into the genetic architecture of the putamen.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chi-Hua Chen"", ids = ""46728992""); list(name = ""Yunpeng Wang"", ids = ""40566190""); list(name = ""Min-Tzu Lo"", ids = ""47631154""); list(name = ""Andrew J.

1537bafd650d60c802ef4b333ddc282555952bbc,Whole-Genome Patterns Of Dna Variation In Maize,"For those genomes low in repetitive DNA, hybridizing total genomic DNA to high-density expression arrays offers an effective strategy for scoring single feature polymorphisms (SFPs). Of the ~2.5 Gb that constitute the maize genome (Zea mays L.), only 10-20% are genic sequences, with large amounts of repetitive DNA intermixed throughout. Therefore, a target preparation method engineered to generate a high genic-to-repetitive DNA ratio is essential for SFP detection in maize. To that end, we tested four gene enrichment and complexity reduction target preparation methods for scoring SFPs on the Affymetrix GeneChip Maize Genome Array (â€œMaize GeneChipâ€). Methylation filtration (MF), Cot filtration (CF), mRNA-derived cRNA, and AFLP methods were applied to three diverse maize inbred lines (B73, Mo17, and CML69) with three replications per line (36 Maize GeneChips). Our results indicate that these particular target preparation methods offer only modest power to detect SFPs with the Maize GeneChip. Most notably, CF and MF are comparable in power, detecting more than 10,000 SFPs at a 20% false discovery rate. Although reducing sample complexity to ~125 Mb by AFLP improves SFP scoring accuracy over other methods, only a minimal number of SFPs are still detected. Our findings of residual repetitive DNA in labeled targets and other experimental errors call for improved gene-enrichment methods and custom array designs to more accurately array genotype 2 M.

c68abbfbc052a92175669d8aa987a5fb353700aa,The False Discovery Rate in ACS : Helping Users to Understand Estimates for Small Domains,"In 2010, the U.S. Census Bureau will publish the first set of 5-year period estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS), based on data for 2005-2009. Published for small places, tracts, and other small areas, the 5-year ACS estimates will attempt to replace the long-form data from recent decennial censuses. Because the effective sample size for the ACS will be somewhat less than half that of previous censuses, users will face an increased challenge to distinguish true variation from sampling error. The concept of the false discovery rate has become increasingly useful in other disciplines confronted by large numbers of estimates, such as micro-array analysis in genetics and fMRI studies of the brain. The paper will review this concept and suggest its possible future application, based on a preliminary analysis of published data from the ACS Multiyear Estimates Study.",2008,,"list(name = ""Robert E.

To better understand the molecular mechanisms of harpin-mediated plant responses, we developed a 3â€™â€“tag digital gene expression (DGE) method to compare the mRNA expression patterns of transgenic T-4 rapeseed harboring and hrf2untransformed Yangyou 4 (Y4) at the global level. Solexa Illumina sequencing yielded 5,645,091 and 6,007,037 clean tags, corresponding to 14,237 and 14,773 genes for Y4 and T-4, respec -tively. We identified 2114 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; log2 ratio ï‚³ 1, false discovery rate [FDR] ï‚£ 0.001) between transgenic T-4 and untransformed Y4 that assigned to seven Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and 19 Gene Ontology categories. Numerous genes related to defense responses were differentially expressed in T-4, represent-ing categories such as hypersensitive response, defense proteins, plant cell wall components, and phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway. Furthermore, expression was largely modified in T-4 in signaling pathways including G protein, Ca2",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Yu Wang"", ids = ""46395038""); list(name = ""Huijun Wu"", ids = ""5279904""); list(name = ""Guifang Wei"", ids = ""40476649""); list(name = ""Hongyue Zhang"", ids = ""51095783""); list(name = ""Yan Gang Zhang"", ids = ""13584997""); list(name = ""Xuewen Gao"", ids = ""145397186"")",1297c096e16e7cd4bc96501b0ebe023d34239fd0; e230011b72adbb6ab41f2708d27dae8d3b07c10b,,Crop Science,55,800-810

We conducted a large-scale evaluation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes for cancer to identify common variants that influence bladder cancer risk. An Illumina GoldenGate assay was used to genotype 1,433 SNPs within or near 386 genes in 1,086 cases and 1,033 controls in Spain. The most significant finding was in the 5' UTR of VEGF (rs25648, p for likelihood ratio test, 2 degrees of freedom = 1 x 10(-5)). To further investigate the region, we analyzed 29 additional SNPs in VEGF, selected to saturate the promoter and 5' UTR and to tag common genetic variation in this gene. Three additional SNPs in the promoter region (rs833052, rs1109324, and rs1547651) were associated with increased risk for bladder cancer: odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.52 (1.06-5.97), 2.74 (1.26-5.98), and 3.02 (1.36-6.63), respectively; and a polymorphism in intron 2 (rs3024994) was associated with reduced risk: 0.65 (0.46-0.91). Two of the promoter SNPs and the intron 2 SNP showed linkage disequilibrium with rs25648. Haplotype analyses revealed three blocks of linkage disequilibrium with significant associations for two blocks including the promoter and 5' UTR (global p = 0.02 and 0.009, respectively). These findings are biologically plausible since VEGF is critical in angiogenesis, which is important for tumor growth, its elevated expression in bladder tumors correlates with tumor progression, and specific 5' UTR haplotypes have been shown to influence promoter activity. Associations between bladder cancer risk and other genes in this report were not robust based on false discovery rate calculations.

95f06b499471dd4413278f5bfd9093581c051ff4,Genome-wide association for the outcome of fixed-time artificial insemination of Brahman heifers in northern Australia.,"Fixed-time AI (FTAI) is a powerful tool for genetic improvement of extensively managed beef cattle. A genomewide association study (GWAS) was conducted to investigate genes and genetic markers associated with the outcome (pregnant or not pregnant) of FTAI in 614 commercial Brahman heifers genotyped for 18,895 SNP and imputed to 51,588 SNP. The likelihood of Brahman heifers becoming pregnant after hormonal treatment to synchronize ovulation followed by FTAI was influenced by the content of their genomes, as determined by a principal component analysis. The principal component analysis involved comparisons between the studied heifers and populations of known and ancestry. The heritability of FTAI outcome was = 0.18, which is higher than for most other reproductive outcome traits. The number of SNP associated with FTAI outcome was 101 ( < 0.001, false discovery rate = 0.53). Compared with all SNP tested, associated SNP had a tendency for highly divergent allelic frequencies between and . Associated SNP were located in nearly all chromosomes, a result that shows a complex genetic architecture that is typical of highly complex traits with low heritability. Considering this and previous GWAS that examined Brahman heifer puberty and postpartum anestrus interval, 3 genomic regions emerge as important for overall Brahman heifer fertility, which mapped to chromosomes 1, 7, and 9. Further analyses, including improved genome annotation, are required to elucidate the link between these regions and heifer fertility. Additional studies are needed to confirm SNP and gene associations reported herein and further elucidate the genetics of FTAI outcome. Future GWAS should target other Braham populations and additional cattle breeds with FTAI records, including breeds with higher ancestry.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Laercio R.

0a1443ec096686524f8f4b461dbf572b233d57d2,QuASARâ€MPRA: accurate alleleâ€specific analysis for massively parallel reporter assays,"Motivation The majority of the human genome is composed of nonâ€coding regions containing regulatory elements such as enhancers, which are crucial for controlling gene expression. Many variants associated with complex traits are in these regions, and may disrupt gene regulatory sequences. Consequently, it is important to not only identify true enhancers but also to test if a variant within an enhancer affects gene regulation. Recently, alleleâ€specific analysis in highâ€throughput reporter assays, such as massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), have been used to functionally validate nonâ€coding variants. However, we are still missing highâ€quality and robust data analysis tools for these datasets. Results We have further developed our method for alleleâ€specific analysis QuASAR (quantitative alleleâ€specific analysis of reads) to analyze alleleâ€specific signals in barcoded read counts data from MPRA. Using this approach, we can take into account the uncertainty on the original plasmid proportions, overâ€dispersion, and sequencing errors. The provided allelic skew estimate and its standard error also simplifies metaâ€analysis of replicate experiments. Additionally, we show that a betaâ€binomial distribution better models the variability present in the allelic imbalance of these synthetic reporters and results in a test that is statistically well calibrated under the null. Applying this approach to the MPRA data, we found 602 SNPs with significant (false discovery rate 10%) alleleâ€specific regulatory function in LCLs. We also show that we can combine MPRA with QuASAR estimates to validate existing experimental and computational annotations of regulatory variants. Our study shows that with appropriate data analysis tools, we can improve the power to detect allelic effects in highâ€throughput reporter assays.

3b6496e8a99eff3a6eb9f85842a2ea008beab516,Increased interleukin-1Î² gene expression in peripheral blood leukocytes is associated with increased pain and predicts risk for progression of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate whether gene expression profiles could serve as biomarkers of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) by examining gene expression profiles in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) from patients with OA compared with those from non-OA controls, and to determine whether candidate genomic biomarkers (PBL expression of inflammatory genes) predict an increased risk of disease progression in patients with symptomatic radiographic knee OA.


METHODS
Three independent cohorts of patients with knee OA and non-OA control subjects were studied. Two cohorts (a learning cohort and a validation cohort) were recruited at New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases (NYUHJD), and 1 cohort (a validation cohort) was recruited at Duke University Medical Center. PBL gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix microarray and was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Radiographic progression at 2 years was assessed in 86 patients.


RESULTS
We identified 173 genes that were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated (â‰¥1.5-fold change) in OA PBLs, at a false discovery rate of 5%. Cluster analysis revealed 2 distinct subgroups among the patients with OA: those in whom the expression of interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) was increased â‰¥2-fold compared with controls, and those in whom the expression of IL-1Î² was comparable with that in controls. Overexpression of IL-1Î² in these OA subclasses was validated using qPCR in all 3 cohorts. Patients with the inflammatory ""IL-1Î² signature"" had higher pain scores and decreased function and were at higher risk of radiographic progression of OA.


CONCLUSION
PBLs from patients with symptomatic knee OA display a characteristic transcriptome profile. Moreover, increased expression of IL-1Î² identifies a subset of patients with OA who have increased pain and are at higher risk of radiographic progression of OA.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mukundan Attur"", ids = ""6329144""); list(name = ""Ilana Belitskaya-Levy"", ids = ""1401710843""); list(name = ""Cheongeun Oh"", ids = ""120739597""); list(name = ""Svetlana Krasnokutsky"", ids = ""6255891""); list(name = ""Jeffrey Greenberg"", ids = ""50560617""); list(name = ""Jonathan Samuels"", ids = ""145179711""); list(name = ""Stephen Smiles"", ids = ""47667259""); list(name = ""Sicy Lee"", ids = ""1459935525""); list(name = ""Jyoti Kandlikar Patel"", ids = ""31372581""); list(name = ""Hayf E Al-Mussawir"", ids = ""1401712928""); list(name = ""G.

608028569a46956877ab1f97e743c6ce03c41302,Bayesian mixture models for complex high dimensional count data in phage display experiments,"Phage display is a biological process that is used to screen random peptide libraries for ligands that bind to a target of interest with high affinity. On the basis of a count data set from an innovative multistage phage display experiment, we propose a class of Bayesian mixture models to cluster peptide counts into three groups that exhibit different display patterns across stages. Among the three groups, the investigators are particularly interested in that with an ascending display pattern in the counts, which implies that the peptides are likely to bind to the target with strong affinity. We apply a Bayesian false discovery rate approach to identify the peptides with the strongest affinity within the group. A list of peptides is obtained, among which important ones with meaningful functions are further validated by biologists. To examine the performance of the Bayesian model, we conduct a simulation study and obtain desirable results.

Several miRNAs have been involved in the regulation of several cellular processes during oncogenesis. Objective: We simultaneously analyzed 18 different breast cancer cell lines (BCC) for miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in order to identify regulatory miRNA target gene networks and novel miRNA-directed therapeutic targets. Materials and Methods: We preprocessed the mRNA and miRNA expression data using R software (justRMA) and performed quantile normalization using background-subtracted log ratio distributions across arrays. We identified 39 hsa-miRNAs with the largest variation across samples and examined the Spearman correlations of miRNAs with the Affymetrix probesets. We calculated false discovery rates for probe sets with stringent correlation coefficients. We performed hierarchical clustering using the 39 miRNAs and correlated dendograms branches with basal/luminal classes. Potential miRNA target genes were identified. We performed pathway analyses by using all 39 miRNA target genes. Western blot analyses were performed to confirm regulation of specific proteins. Results: We demonstrated 39 deregulated miRNAs and 10612 mRNA targets genes in BCC. Twenty-three miRNAs were upregulated in basal and downregulated in the luminal groups targeting 6790 genes, and 16 miRNAs downregulated in basal and upregulated in luminal cells, targeting 3822 genes. The first direct comparison screening for the 39 miRNAs and all mRNAs identified 29 direct pairs where the correlation magnitude was above 0.9. MiR-221/222, -31, -143/145, -34a, -200 were the most and consistently deregulated miRNAs in all luminal and basal like BCC. We identified genes, such as CD59, PDGF -Î² and discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1-DDR1 and different cancer network pathways, such as cell cycle and cell surface markers, potentially regulated by a subset of these miRNAs. Interestingly, we found that the expression of single genes might be regulated by several miRNAs. Conclusions: We found a specific miRNA signature and respective genome targets that well defined different clusters of BCC. Breast cancer cell lines are associated with changes in expression of multiple miRNAs that, in turn, disrupt a network of genes that either activate or inhibit important cellular functions. A better understanding of the network of genes and cellular pathways regulated by these miRNAs will enable to understand breast cancer pathogenesis and miRNA based breast cancer therapy.

67eb74d1038e9f78f462139883b64172725c73ba,Identification of Differentially Expressed Proteins in Direct Expressed Prostatic Secretions of Men with Organ-confined Versus Extracapsular Prostate Cancer*â–¡S,"Current protocols for the screening of prostate cancer cannot accurately discriminate clinically indolent tumors from more aggressive ones. One reliable indicator of outcome has been the determination of organ-confined versus nonorgan-confined disease but even this determination is often only made following prostatectomy. This underscores the need to explore alternate avenues to enhance outcome prediction of prostate cancer patients. Fluids that are proximal to the prostate, such as expressed prostatic secretions (EPS), are attractive sources of potential prostate cancer biomarkers as these fluids likely bathe the tumor. Direct-EPS samples from 16 individuals with extracapsular (n 8) or organ-confined (n 8) prostate cancer were used as a discovery cohort, and were analyzed in duplicate by a nine-step MudPIT on a LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. A total of 624 unique proteins were identified by at least two unique peptides with a 0.2% false discovery rate. A semiquantitative spectral counting algorithm identified 133 significantly differentially expressed proteins in the discovery cohort. Integrative data mining prioritized 14 candidates, including two known prostate cancer biomarkers: prostate-specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase, which were significantly elevated in the direct-EPS from the organ-confined cancer group. These and five other candidates (SFN, MME, PARK7, TIMP1, and TGM4) were verified by Western blotting in an independent set of direct-EPS from patients with biochemically recurrent disease (n 5) versus patients with no evidence of recurrence upon follow-up (n 10). Lastly, we performed proof-of-concept SRM-MSbased relative quantification of the five candidates using unpurified heavy isotope-labeled synthetic peptides spiked into pools of EPS-urines from men with extracapsular and organ-confined prostate tumors. This study represents the first efforts to define the direct-EPS proteome from two major subclasses of prostate cancer using shotgun proteomics and verification in EPS-urine by SRM-MS.

While the inhibition of protein farnesylation is the primary mechanism of action (MOA), the level of farnesyl inhibition is not a reliable pharmacodynamic marker of response, nor is it clear what genetic markers can be employed to predict response. This prospectively designed study was conducted to identify potential genetic markers and expression signatures that may be surrogate predictors of response for tipifarnib in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Bone marrow samples were collected and gene expression profiles analyzed from a single arm phase 2 clinical study of tipifarnib in poor-risk patients with newly diagnosed AML (Lancet, et al. Blood. 2004;104:249a). In total, 79 samples were obtained before (n = 25), during (n = 30), and after (n = 24) tipifarnib treatment. Bone marrow samples were analyzed using the Affymetrix U133A GeneChipÂ® array. Global gene expression signatures revealed that tipifarnib treatment resulted in gene expression changes that were maintained for up to 120 days following treatment termination. Pretreatment vs posttreatment samples identified approximately 500 genes that had significant changes (False Discovery Rate [FDR] <0.005) in gene expression following farnesyltransferase inhibition, including several genes associated with farnesylation (eg, K-ras, FNTA). Many of the modulated genes were identified as those significantly involved in protein biosynthesis, DNA replication, intracellular signaling, and cell cycle pathways, thus, reflective of inhibition of cellular proliferation. A subset of 27 genes (including genes associated with signal transduction and cell cycle) was also identified as being differentially modulated between responders and nonresponders ( P <0.01). Gene expression signatures previously identified from a phase 2 clinical trial in relapsed and refractory AML were also tested in pretreatment samples to examine their ability to predict response (Raponi, et al. Blood. 2004;104:246a). A combination of 6 genes was found to have significant predictive accuracy in this independent set of samples ( P = 0.05). The genes identified from these studies might be used as surrogate biomarkers of tipifarnib activity.",2005,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mitch Raponi"", ids = ""3525913""); list(name = ""Yi Zhang"", ids = ""39831777""); list(name = ""Tim Jatkoe"", ids = ""5670979""); list(name = ""Jack S.

ab8bbad13f1cd7d1c816fc5c5b6a752ade172942,Transcriptomic profiles of aging in purified human immune cells,"BackgroundTranscriptomic studies hold great potential towards understanding the human aging process. Previous transcriptomic studies have identified many genes with age-associated expression levels; however, small samples sizes and mixed cell types often make these results difficult to interpret.ResultsUsing transcriptomic profiles in CD14+ monocytes from 1,264 participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (aged 55â€“94 years), we identified 2,704 genes differentially expressed with chronological age (false discovery rate, FDRâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.001). We further identified six networks of co-expressed genes that included prominent genes from three pathways: protein synthesis (particularly mitochondrial ribosomal genes), oxidative phosphorylation, and autophagy, with expression patterns suggesting these pathways decline with age. Expression of several chromatin remodeler and transcriptional modifier genes strongly correlated with expression of oxidative phosphorylation and ribosomal protein synthesis genes. 17% of genes with age-associated expression harbored CpG sites whose degree of methylation significantly mediated the relationship between age and gene expression (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Lastly, 15 genes with age-associated expression were also associated (FDRâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.01) with pulse pressure independent of chronological age.Comparing transcriptomic profiles of CD14+ monocytes to CD4+ T cells from a subset (nâ€‰=â€‰423) of the population, we identified 30 age-associated (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.01) genes in common, while larger sets of differentially expressed genes were unique to either T cells (188 genes) or monocytes (383 genes). At the pathway level, a decline in ribosomal protein synthesis machinery gene expression with age was detectable in both cell types.ConclusionsAn overall decline in expression of ribosomal protein synthesis genes with age was detected in CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ T cells, demonstrating that some patterns of aging are likely shared between different cell types. Our findings also support cell-specific effects of age on gene expression, illustrating the importance of using purified cell samples for future transcriptomic studies. Longitudinal work is required to establish the relationship between identified age-associated genes/pathways and aging-related diseases.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Lindsay M Reynolds"", ids = ""34738609""); list(name = ""Jingzhong Ding"", ids = ""29628078""); list(name = ""Jackson R.

6509eb79ff367891b2bd12c7228a45299eaefa69,It is time for a comprehensive analytical approach in clinical studies. Virus-versus-host interaction and influenza disease severity.,"A better understanding of the complex interactions between a virus and its ability to replicate, and the host immune response that attempts to control it, is critical to define the factors and mechanisms that determine disease severity. This will also facilitate the identification of biomarkers that can objectively predict clinical outcomes. In the past two decades, we have experienced significant advances in our ability to predict clinical outcomes in a number of viral infections, such as HIV, hepatitis C, and cytomegalovirus. This is accomplished by accurately measuring viral loads and immune markers in the blood, where viral replication and immune responses can be determined simultaneously. Indeed, measuring viral loads and immune markers (such as CD4 T cells in HIV infection) in the blood provides such a precise assessment of outcomes that it has become part of standard clinical care (1). Unfortunately, that is not the case for influenza and other respiratory viral infections. Despite the enormous global health impact of viral respiratory infections such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (2, 3), we still lack accurate virologic and immune markers to predict clinical outcomes. Those are critical to guide clinical care or facilitate patient stratification for designing interventional trials. This is a consequence of the challenges involved in studying the virus-versus-host interplay in both the respiratory tract and systemic compartment in the relevant clinical population. In this issue of the Journal, Oshansky and colleagues (pp. 449â€“462) provide a model example on how to approach such an investigation in patients with acute influenza infection (4). To identify markers of disease severity, they implemented an ambitious and wide-ranging approach. They simultaneously measured a number of virologic and immune markers using multifaceted molecular and cellular assays and state of the art tools for data analysis. They obtained sequential samples in two different compartments, the systemic (blood) and the respiratory tract (nasal lavage), in a diverse cohort of patients of different ages and severity and used a variety of assays to measure viral replication, cytokine responses, neutralizing antibodies, and monocyte populations. This comprehensive strategy revealed a number of unexpected findings: (1) As expected, young age was associated with increased disease severity. However, viral loads and shedding were similar in children and adults and they did not correlate with disease severity. (2) Young children displayed a more robust innate cytokine response than adults, especially in the respiratory tract, and this was independent of viral load. (3) An innate immune profile characterized by increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3) and IFN-a2 in nasal lavage and plasma IL-10 samples predicted progression to severe disease, and increased plasma IL-10, MCP-3 and IL-6 predicted hospitalization. (4) This cytokine profile also correlated with recruitment of monocytes to the respiratory tract, with conventional monocytes that positively correlated with inflammation while CD14 monocytes were present in patients with lower concentrations of inflammatory cytokines. (5) Finally, the analysis demonstrated substantial differences in immune responses between the systemic and respiratory compartment. The authorsâ€™ overall conclusion was that the innate immune response, especially in the respiratory mucosa, was the most relevant factor that correlated with (or determined) disease severity, and this was independent of viral dynamics and age. Furthermore, this association was independent of existing neutralizing antibody titers. These observations challenge the traditional view on the role of adaptive immunity in controlling disease progression, especially in the early phase of the infection, and suggest that regulation of the innate response may be more important to determine the ultimate outcome. It is important to point out, as the authors indicated, that it was not simply that an exaggerated general inflammationwas associatedwith a poor outcome, but it was a specific immune profile defined byMCP-3, IFN-a2, and IL-10 that predicted disease severity. Identification of this particular immune profile was not straightforward, as it required multivariate logistic regression analysis that was adjusted for age effects and false discovery rate. Despite the strengths of the study design and the significance of the novel observations, many questions still remain. It is unclear whether the authors could identify a unique innate immune profile that was associated with protection against disease progression and better outcomes. Recent studies in children with RSV infection challenged the previously established idea that an exaggerated innate response is associated with worse outcomes. These studies indicate that in certain situations an inadequate innate response is associated with increased disease severity, whereas a robust innate response leads to better outcomes (5â€“7). Comparative studies in children with RSV and influenza lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) showed higher cytokine concentrations in nasopharyngeal secretions in patients with influenza despite the fact that RSV generally causes more severe LRTIs. Analyses of lungs from of fatal cases of influenza and RSV infection demonstrated a lack of antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells and natural killer cells, and infiltrates of abundant neutrophils and macrophages with positive staining for viral antigens. These investigators concluded that severe RSV and influenza virus LRTIs are characterized by inadequate, rather than excessive, adaptive immune responses and enhanced viral replication (8). They observed an enhanced innate response, but they did not mention specific components. Hence, there is a clear need to identify and separate the â€œprotectiveâ€ and â€œdetrimentalâ€ innate responses, and Oshansky and colleagues (4) have illustrated an approach toward that goal. Transcriptional profile analyses of individuals with acute influenza infection showed significant activation of the innate immune responses, with prominent overexpression of IFN signaling pathways (9â€“11), but also a marked suppression of the adaptive immune response genes (9, 10). Another intriguing and critical observation of the present study was the apparent lack of correlation between preexisting antibody EDITORIALS",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Octavio Ramilo"", ids = ""6542093""); list(name = ""Asuncion Mejias"", ids = ""145709822"")",54bb36f838740d30a4d830a221c0cfabe790ecf0; 2da00410d7f482e123746a06bedba02915451981,044c48437c05225a4438cdcb8fdb2ccc53d8d3d4; fc81e5f6c887bc16507d1e45a444e5fa4adb8b91; c1b738c33718709f436dc47344eaf56165e5e3df; 7b378329858c73e1397d02795ced5669ba742a35; d385988f0109a9a06751c59564cf5081dfc6a5ea; 2de91a35667bb2801d4b2ee61080c9367eccbb17; 10924d076c9a5381e2a5c133c55555469bcbbe7e; 39dbf2510106ef4bcac168799a516482d210556d; 6db288ca0626197067e4fd16d8715023d36103b0; 06fabf4bcfac0b483bae5707c6a646975830de95; 6ab7c37ec4488975e6be73919d5c089b1597e909; d9d57e6e5eaf077c1223b5295b461b7f2f1cfc82; 9ac3e53f7c67446a2d637d3769ee5723e8ca311a; 2922b4bdb2dba5cec3fba694b6452f65986afdbb,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,189 4,"

3264f21e5757d26cc75e2a4ff523747732dfd843,Estimating minimum effect with outlier selection.,"We introduce one-sided versions of Huber's contamination model, in which corrupted samples tend to take larger values than uncorrupted ones. Two intertwined problems are addressed: estimation of the mean of uncorrupted samples (minimum effect) and selection of corrupted samples (outliers). Regarding the minimum effect estimation, we derive the minimax risks and introduce adaptive estimators to the unknown number of contaminations. Interestingly, the optimal convergence rate highly differs from that in classical Huber's contamination model. Also, our analysis uncovers the effect of particular structural assumptions on the distribution of the contaminated samples. As for the problem of selecting the outliers, we formulate the problem in a multiple testing framework for which the location/scaling of the null hypotheses are unknown. We rigorously prove how estimating the null hypothesis is possible while maintaining a theoretical guarantee on the amount of the falsely selected outliers, both through false discovery rate (FDR) or post hoc bounds. As a by-product, we address a long-standing open issue on FDR control under equi-correlation, which reinforces the interest of removing dependency when making multiple testing.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Alexandra Carpentier"", ids = ""37178915""); list(name = ""Sylvain Delattre"", ids = ""2654204""); list(name = ""Etienne Roquain"", ids = ""3117456""); list(name = ""Nicolas Verzelen"", ids = ""1905290"")",ab6ff50ff141333b65680bfe9dcd3f7999af102a; 3264f21e5757d26cc75e2a4ff523747732dfd843; bf57f04334584e87b037ba320af012190b0a4b2b; b30ef6d39c299568d63d5b14a17183fbde643964; 2e488a41be92c90da85a58656c233d70f6d3967e,04f7eb10b37138f3c1a962f8319fb60b690f8632; 3209b7e1dde59a28b7452e19b884d45ccb1bc704; d0a46ffad171210b33ce4ed75bd8d207f16e7d9e; 6416371037e6d6e602931e9674285f06ca2bb424; 4440efc12b63fd87c8e9336ea39ee35b33d8c1c7; c6f66a45e58c7fe228f16f4f822a1a042a22d8db; a9082bbfcc2b4374f4367d47e14ed76d73cf4d70; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 12b7d0e559b4e601c632e4cce84920eb6175b714; 8d4a82f8262abfb55754990665146f8bca94d8d6; b8c7ccfa5365c323198909825651a88f759fd612; a5b8e6ddd9197a7551c2171c1c8d94e14d867e12; d6e477e034b0edd0ba217f8f83c0703f08cd3871; d69e0f34ca397dd1cef213e35e7b715165c3f0db; 1c09afaa4bdc00a66643c3d16504dec85474cde0; e6fbec5d97a9b9ec3b04f72079387352752cbab5; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; 6cd45f7034f5bd148c225a477412bfbe18fee0b6; 2def5ea8b905c5742e989279f14bab82e560a07e; 0f183f61a79634280bf5a7fe17b06b99bee0ff41; 7118264c8f38f0b45a497defc716e392ca673236; 3264f21e5757d26cc75e2a4ff523747732dfd843; 2888f87e01c7adfd95f02c52339a7db8ad329677; 79ee6103a4a8efa556693810d513216ba0a9cc7c; 77ccad5e03bc179b0a5fd03b9501e34d95771144; 4c93ea4e4e605786d590acf5639662a14a2060fa; 73f77dc92c49ad3e580ec5d9d07e365e6432d755; 329b4df28ea1eba0bd6a98c1eeb476e52a0edd7c; 14b741a091d7eae2a7b1c27281a9e4417a587f08; 1430768ccec9db916ae976a1d06611921c3cd457; 950989cbd8b55ce56f2b86b5769a9e6ba393c614; 6d3fb1482ea20a3d75d39c0147977e775c1af173; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; a4a54e99db300b6a4be35cfd255bf57d5122af01; 275a6c6ee2badd48096441e3174f9ed86926dee7; e4ab1fbeeaebfc457fb16cd366cf4745feae5a9a; a341db559063cdb1d03408d86c2704c380580298; 38bbf429b8553626f2bdc24be79b1eb6f5d0951d; 61b371f1b26af6f2503f7ff27974420658af1f26; 15c790cfa8afff058ce02b342ebe20ee7c045750; a97e8af759381536766a5c2dfcb611fa0066c93c; 2bfa6da4ca55515feeca5d8fda394632fd059d97; 2a6de51d86f13e9eb7efa85491682dad0ccd65e8; b0397532153c0978f75bd542b73db0349db8ad1c; ccdfb9985ce6c83428715bc93dd5eb325a785b74; 7302febdec049235971895db54aef77e7624dc3e; dc2b412ee7c3911d3b299c54ebb064b80f5f580d; 520ef23820a082fe4233bf2013233e1b8d4b7df4; 6ce2dabd841d3822fc00a59c88e3647180353be7; c87d57da3b1f2b467ef4995d30df832ee2281107; 0f4ea95b4de8e2bf750d2e5edfb4acd13b3d2e7d; 75295c0816d6855e39e08a194d93cccaa9e901dc; 7257e36300852af50a189fb278a0355d49eb1c16; be8a0ffbda6b3dd8c1a1057d530d17003bc58c6c; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; b8e37c1f4d5a1338f3d04aa9e2fb9551b0b05234; 2249ea630e56e4991aa157ad9aea65262efe4562; e9f68c3f1fdecb8b681e46faaa0e7028fe015987; e57029ad2e2ab15e63b2c953a17e166fddaf2c38; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc; b87f4739dd5c2a23fda445e46ceb994b4c8e78d1; 5c5becc796db9bb107d4908f40746d82ccae0fe4; be3681e06bb3b0635b9a3775935dd15c0151c823; 1b60c4fddb8ab5475bc3295a2d0af4b1167bc444; 60f9c181ff8e25e80b5b30df8823014d843b7322; 914ae0d35a987f60f6db4c96107c2ad83370ae8e,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,
a749231282efc1f88aca2aa6144f1aaceefcbe21,An assessment of false discovery rates and statistical significance in label-free quantitative proteomics with combined filters,"BackgroundMany studies have provided algorithms or methods to assess a statistical significance in quantitative proteomics when multiple replicates for a protein sample and a LC/MS analysis are available. But, confidence is still lacking in using datasets for a biological interpretation without protein sample replicates. Although a fold-change is a conventional threshold that can be used when there are no sample replicates, it does not provide an assessment of statistical significance such as a false discovery rate (FDR) which is an important indicator of the reliability to identify differentially expressed proteins. In this work, we investigate whether differentially expressed proteins can be detected with a statistical significance from a pair of unlabeled protein samples without replicates and with only duplicate LC/MS injections per sample. A FDR is used to gauge the statistical significance of the differentially expressed proteins.ResultsWe have experimented to operate on several parameters to control a FDR, including a fold-change, a statistical test, and a minimum number of permuted significant pairings. Although none of these parameters alone gives a satisfactory control of a FDR, we find that a combination of these parameters provides a very effective means to control a FDR without compromising the sensitivity. The results suggest that it is possible to perform a significance analysis without protein sample replicates. Only duplicate LC/MS injections per sample are needed. We illustrate that differentially expressed proteins can be detected with a FDR between 0 and 15% at a positive rate of 4â€“16%. The method is evaluated for its sensitivity and specificity by a ROC analysis, and is further validated with a [15N]-labeled internal-standard protein sample and additional unlabeled protein sample replicates.ConclusionWe demonstrate that a statistical significance can be inferred without protein sample replicates in label-free quantitative proteomics. The approach described in this study would be useful in many exploratory experiments where a sample amount or instrument time is limited. Naturally, this method is also suitable for proteomics experiments where multiple sample replicates are available. It is simple, and is complementary to other more sophisticated algorithms that are not designed for dealing with a small number of sample replicates.",2008,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Qingbo Li"", ids = ""50444364""); list(name = ""Bryan A.

181cdea5bf9eae0be5f58d356fd9227107d2a1e4,Functional magnetic resonance imaging reveals age-related alterations to motor networks in weighted elbow flexion-extension movement.,"OBJECTIVE
we investigated whether motor system activity in normal aging shows age-related alteration during a non-isomeric elbow flexion-extension movement task using weights.


METHODS
Twenty-six healthy, right-handed elderly and 20 healthy, right-handed young subjects without any psychiatric, neurological, or medical disease participated in this study. All subjects underwent two consecutive scanning sessions: one without weights, and one with weights. During the weights session, each subject held a small non-metallic bar (weighing approximately 1 kg) with their dominant hand and performed elbow flexion and extension movements. Functional magnetic resonance imaging BOLD contrast was obtained for each subject using a 3.0 T MRI scanner. Image processing and statistical analyses were carried out using SPM2. In fMRI data group analysis, contrast images from the analysis of individual subjects were analysed by one-sample t-tests, thereby generating a random-effects model, allowing inference to the general population. The SPM{t}s were thresholded at P<0.01, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected for multiple comparisons across the whole brain. Finally, the resulting activation maps were created and displayed by projection onto the anatomically standardized mean T1 image of all subjects to identify the anatomical correlates of the activity.


RESULTS
It was revealed that the main change in the aging brain was significant activation of the ipsilateral basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical motor loop in older subjects, suggesting the recruitment of additional brain areas during the execution of a weighted elbow motor task as a compensation process for age-related neurobiological change.


CONCLUSION
The current study is the first to demonstrate significant differences in brain activation between old and young subjects during weighted elbow flexion-extension movement when both the old and young groups maintain the same performance level. In particular, overactivation of the basal ganglia in the aging brain appears to play a crucial role in counteracting age-related decline of force generation and to support the same level of performance as that of younger counterparts.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Joo-Hyun Kim"", ids = ""69353965""); list(name = ""Yang-Soo Lee"", ids = ""2777854""); list(name = ""Jae-Jun Lee"", ids = ""2461837""); list(name = ""Hui-Jin Song"", ids = ""2064171""); list(name = ""Done-sik Yoo"", ids = ""5849419""); list(name = ""Hui Joong Lee"", ids = ""2576343""); list(name = ""Hye-Jung Kim"", ids = ""1836051""); list(name = ""Yongmin Chang"", ids = ""3157734"")",8062049d1489f812b823965e2b49bad51dd4ec08; f90085ed522584ff1877ad15c78ed1e12250df62; 592a1578936b272ed3bd252110089179dcfdc4f4; bc7276fa8da485f7317319ba48466addf873cd26,11dcaddab76b153584471e6919ff25cabda92ace; 9564477aaa5b59b68ecae786746d69453a6b450b; 1649fb8af79b236e59775a81cf5989a9a0b3b0b1; e9c8e4771a237f29adccbb8aa9275f458fc12b32; 178e7b76a8555a7333b1a2306a70fe2818ea5917; 6adf587dfc9010a5d8b788f180a8412c5c434c8f; 66c2546903d4611669fe47264ea39ddd743ad8fd; 7f37ab5a1af979e726107e6ab1542b3d4c3db28b; a8cf4314a0c4b957dd7b55f11cb9ff176a6bebef; b81570361099fa193d0d52a812bffa5cd347b78a; 3add9431310756b012e801809baba765dfdfcf68; 4ccdfbf00438e3f10389c812f9edd111782676f9; 13587f5cb1cd9d7cb680883e6f19c70206ffaa43; 47366bd0825196b578c6171c20a512d9c860bc9c; 0188fc6035fec31c96a587d6bc0ae0af881556f5; 16577105cc70638459568bc6816f74011cd242c2; b2ed0258ecbf19f48e9a228f02b72bbb705c99c9; fee6ec946374375045d8c1e2ec464cfde2e1ca9f; 724f6b2b427d39239a1203a5d494ee0c5a13028b; aaf3469f3b2c2ea15657b248cade351ce8aaf95a; e01d5b98d9fdf020682403c878eb940c5f60bb9f; 90287df4fc23dcd9f2faa0607fbc3c45a1903428; 3fd1331f8ef849c0e7794864dc59c35415466d05; eea0433bc13e75e63a8be8c731cc09e4722a6263; 58de481b221eb5800aee5a506feccb9dff63bd9a; c021d308c51aa7d0be0208b62ada7400a0599333; 8f9d35961e35e16f9170a2485bf2e336a7a1a3a6; 4427ab8b1aecbe4429f06a35fccdb44d8b748e16; e83321dc8cae03707f228b7a9fc4f6b86d55fcac; fea91d1b8fc0bcceff436d42f1852f0047d69369; 43d84c73ab06f3abdb57680edeebe7c67004641e; f5bb4f0a20e3857d65e93003c61de6fe86138fad; e4abf3b40195f962e82bc860353ab3e805692e23; 7014a0fcb782fab289fd7e732a5900a80aa1bbc9; 27659c15fd5ca59883c825c37a53f30d86e67021; 46493b062f9b684b5a47d7468572faea6642e8de; 2a4a7b5afd6dfe38ad4b1883b16233f39102e241; 873429db30da685caa3e354d26fbdbdc90f1ddf7; 4acc04e5fb66d0668334ef9807d82cf8fdb5f34a,Neurological research,32 9,"

8ffba7ba3659fa0bb433f52c091b13cfb372c2e8,GAT: a simulation framework for testing the association of genomic intervals,"MOTIVATION
A common question in genomic analysis is whether two sets of genomic intervals overlap significantly. This question arises, for example, when interpreting ChIP-Seq or RNA-Seq data in functional terms. Because genome organization is complex, answering this question is non-trivial.


SUMMARY
We present Genomic Association Test (GAT), a tool for estimating the significance of overlap between multiple sets of genomic intervals. GAT implements a null model that the two sets of intervals are placed independently of one another, but allows each set's density to depend on external variables, for example, isochore structure or chromosome identity.

4bd9d9b97693b9df59ce09f61fcd904378aea4e7,What affects detectability of lesionâ€“deficit relationships in lesion studies?,"Elucidating the brain basis for psychological processes and behavior is a fundamental aim of cognitive neuroscience. The lesion method, using voxel-based statistical analysis, is an important approach to this goal, identifying neural structures that are necessary for the support of specific mental operations, and complementing the strengths of functional imaging techniques. Lesion coverage in a population is by nature spatially heterogeneous and biased, systematically affecting the ability of lesion-deficit correlation methods to detect and localize functional associations. We have developed a simulator that allows investigators to model parameters in a lesion-deficit study and characterize the statistical bias in lesion deficit detection coverage that will result from specific assumptions. We used the simulator to assess the signal detection properties and localization accuracy of standard lesion-deficit correlation methods, under a simple truth model - that a critical region of interest (CR), when damaged, gives rise to a deficit. We considered voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) and proportional MAP-3 (PM3). Using regression analysis, we examined if the pattern of outcome statistics can be explained by simulation parameters, factors that are inherent to anatomic parcels, and lesion coverage of the population, which consisted of a representative sample of 351 subjects drawn from the Iowa Patient Registry. We examined the effect of using nonparametric versus parametric statistics to obtain thresholded maps and the effect of correcting for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate or cluster-based correction. Our results, which are derived from samples of realistic lesions, indicate that even a simple truth model yields localization errors that are systematic and pervasive, averaging 2 cm in the standard anatomic space, and tending to be directed towards areas of greater anatomic coverage. This displacement positions the center of mass of the detected region in a different anatomical region 87% of the time. This basic result is not affected by the choice of PM3 vs VLSM as the fundamental approach, nor is localization error ameliorated by incorporation of lesion size as a covariate in the VLSM approach, or by data distribution-driven approaches to controlling multiple spatial comparisons (false discovery rate or cluster-based correction approaches). Our simulations offer a quantitative basis for interpreting lesion studies in cognitive neuroscience. We suggest ways in which lesion simulation and analysis frameworks could be productively extended.",2014,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kayo Inoue"", ids = ""115987494""); list(name = ""Tara M.

70d4b1a7e18370f9d3116a03b6bdc2c5bb45a869,Identifying differentially methylated genes using mixed effect and generalized least square models,"BackgroundDNA methylation plays an important role in the process of tumorigenesis. Identifying differentially methylated genes or CpG islands (CGIs) associated with genes between two tumor subtypes is thus an important biological question. The methylation status of all CGIs in the whole genome can be assayed with differential methylation hybridization (DMH) microarrays. However, patient samples or cell lines are heterogeneous, so their methylation pattern may be very different. In addition, neighboring probes at each CGI are correlated. How these factors affect the analysis of DMH data is unknown.ResultsWe propose a new method for identifying differentially methylated (DM) genes by identifying the associated DM CGI(s). At each CGI, we implement four different mixed effect and generalized least square models to identify DM genes between two groups. We compare four models with a simple least square regression model to study the impact of incorporating random effects and correlations.ConclusionsWe demonstrate that the inclusion (or exclusion) of random effects and the choice of correlation structures can significantly affect the results of the data analysis.

The exponential growth in microarray experiments has spawned a number of investigations into the reliability and reproducibility of this type of data. However, the sample size requirements necessary to obtain statistically significant results has not had as much attention. We report here statistical methods for the determination of the sufficient number of subjects necessary to minimize the false discovery rate while maintaining high power to detect differentially expressed genes. Two experimental designs were considered: 1) a comparison between two groups at a single time point, and 2) a comparison of two experimental groups with sequential time points.

b610af3b54ef8bdebbc54a4876c211b72b5a2a5c,Cutaneous transcriptome analysis in NIH hairless mice,"Mice with spontaneous coat mutations are ideal animal models for studying skin development and tumorigenesis. In this study, skin hair growth cycle abnormalities were examined in NIH hairless mice 42 days after birth (P42) by using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. To examine the gene expression patterns in the skin of mutant mice, the dorsal skin of P42 female NIH mice and NIH hairless mice was sequenced by RNA-Seq, and 5,068 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (false discovery rate [FDR] â‰¥ 2, P < 0.05). A pathway analysis showed that basal cell carcinoma, the cell cycle and the Hippo, Hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathways were up-regulated in NIH hairless mice. Previous studies have shown that these pathways are closely associated with cell proliferation, cell cycle, organ size and cancer development. In contrast, signal transduction, bacterial and parasitic infection, and receptor-mediated pathways, including calcium signaling, were down-regulated in NIH hairless mice. A gene interaction network analysis was performed to identify genes related to hair follicle development. To verify the reliability of the RNA-Seq results, we used q-PCR to analyze 12 key genes identified from the gene interaction network analysis, including eight down-regulated and four up-regulated genes, and the results confirmed the reliability of the RNA-Seq results. Finally, we constructed the differential gene expression profiles of mutant mice by RNA-Seq. NIH hairless mice exhibited abnormalities in hair development and immune-related pathways. Pik3r1 and Pik3r3 were identified as key genes, laying the foundation for additional in-depth studies of hairless mice.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Zhong-Hao Ji"", ids = ""22369845""); list(name = ""Jian Chen"", ids = ""145471813""); list(name = ""Wei Gao"", ids = ""145816333""); list(name = ""Jinyu Zhang"", ids = ""123275406""); list(name = ""Fu-Shi Quan"", ids = ""74412550""); list(name = ""Jin-ping Hu"", ids = ""47756550""); list(name = ""Bao Yuan"", ids = ""143741120""); list(name = ""Wenzhi Ren"", ids = ""4858088"")",d2dc78220d2abcb9dbcb65bc4ebbdfa32152325f; fa8f96ee6c3571aa5c02b884aaf00f054a4383b5,eeccc9cc7d8163ff4d63d23262758da301937261; e2283fc9225e8dd4cf2578532a3341d580b8df81; 17d5726d439b6909b31c9c8d50e1ba176d4876d7; 1037d040888c5db8123cf47706b89e1b9bdd4f9d; 19c7a1c772c73616bbfecc72c1047066e1c36c52; 5b4baf7cae6b3613bd0dde1f6d31c5c1412856f2; 7cad8811b26d3a47012b7aaf41e3a84645c0d908; d8b9eac947dbf604900957c429a658a9204677ab; b77e723de247a94b18edabfcdff6a80bee148888; 1d23ddc986a320c9c7bc1d972eadece86606c62b; 86784272647e7a8358e3477dbd25f0ff320212f9; 1a7743343d141fb24ccc91a5589b1fea4235295a; ec6e1894dd5528d2b6fe3f9dfa5d34a93f179e4e; 6c4de645a3082e66dfeabcbae72c76b9437bd732; aeab6f66b7fac0c365064ab59c9e0b8c2eb16d1d; d157ab5efe1c78cf338e2cb556187fb958434af0; a05c6c3c1986139dda37c10702e6bd6049be27c9; 1ac5067b6429382d82e220461ca1b6ca430e7767; a462ee3d64edf189e075451ca7cb728bcc9e5fb3; 3531ee2bc820dfd478ac0a939baaf05937a1a07d; 39dae53515afb42664369c291ec6d1ce34d778bd; 318608e0b81f0272574189ea37f31e315355db66; aac61dbdad235c440e11cf6944e91f1fbdb653a7; b21f818631f742ef732340597741e52c37eca6e6; dec6e68ab96291bf361d7a02306d556c92fd60a6; e542694b2f3ff8cd49c86f518f4ff872d5880542; 3fe5fadb394c8699f369124b71bde3b089bc144a; 220730fa53194e9d8d6772774e5e046f07cc6b34; db6804f575ad6325601eff94d2093e20918d5dc6; 5c2f685505fb98c6f9edb0964293b07016f76dcc; 18475c5d49e71210a33b1f11a68c1af7ad561a19; bc58589c8b6ecbf3b93af2947ec78ef9dd948727; 230c91103f6e4d54d4b3d299588ab0c466e36805; 28ccf3cc99fa2763a29b4f71e2effa655a48a4f0; 3e4d556655884823f40076bd1abf76d03c9533e1; f4970e982763d2eeb09cf853013d0b32f80189ac; c2d817f02120e560b9b0ff3767f7c28e54d4f480; ccc83d959750386f02dec62455d24cbdefffeb62; f76355dda73e4e06526c965ec6600e28661cdbc8; 6f2faa7c2b5b4a71a61cd04c4a6b71ebecb3fae4; c3e7744f052a00323af9132d2592f64d861afa41; b355352840c4884e5e84d47065454d9bf72ef80c; e8f7192873a7eab54d8f845f5bf5fc450cbe2e37; 55a4accff58340ba0e3fa875a33556d91c5d77fc; 34a2ddfda12c910e347c793c9341f9584dc56e3b; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; a33bbacc55b69adf894bbb1b423b9b4c5b031ae0,PLoS ONE,12,
c3b5d5e7eb19a156309ae29f4c1f89b4e7177dbf,Adaptive thresholds to detect differentially expressed genes in microarray data,"To detect changes in gene expression data from microarrays, a fixed threshold for fold difference is used widely. However, it is not always guaranteed that a threshold value which is appropriate for highly expressed genes is suitable for lowly expressed genes. In this study, aiming at detecting truly differentially expressed genes from a wide expression range, we proposed an adaptive threshold method (AT). The adaptive thresholds, which have different values for different expression levels, are calculated based on two measurements under the same condition. The sensitivity, specificity and false discovery rate (FDR) of AT were investigated by simulations. The sensitivity and specificity under various noise conditions were greater than 89.7% and 99.32%, respectively. The FDR was smaller than 0.27. These results demonstrated the reliability of the method.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yutaka Fukuoka"", ids = ""38119865""); list(name = ""Hidenori Inaoka"", ids = ""1766757""); list(name = ""Makoto Noshiro"", ids = ""49872463"")",0f6aa9cff2daa2538d78d6b7d3679ff55776a08e,,Bioinformation,7,33 - 37
2b51f228cb47ef9de195aaff6c03fae3b41047f6,Solving the Empirical Bayes Normal Means Problem with Correlated Noise,"The Normal Means problem plays a fundamental role in many areas of modern high-dimensional statistics, both in theory and practice. And the Empirical Bayes (EB) approach to solving this problem has been shown to be highly effective, again both in theory and practice. However, almost all EB treatments of the Normal Means problem assume that the observations are independent. In practice correlations are ubiquitous in real-world applications, and these correlations can grossly distort EB estimates. Here, exploiting theory from Schwartzman (2010), we develop new EB methods for solving the Normal Means problem that take account of unknown correlations among observations. We provide practical software implementations of these methods, and illustrate them in the context of large-scale multiple testing problems and False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. In realistic numerical experiments our methods compare favorably with other commonly-used multiple testing methods.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Lei Sun"", ids = ""48243862""); list(name = ""Matthew Stephens"", ids = ""145761702"")",d8e7a03c6ee282130425e170dd3927165aaad1a1,2446ff36818d62c8851e39bef95da9c02235388a; db058714aebc7268d7e318ad1e189d19b444727e; 10a9c831fc885576d16f86603f5372dc0b341cf0; dabebd5a228ed00831feea1a64a90ff376fc6d2b; 359cbc3cd6c9d106d28b6c90debb7b89057f30d4; 5412be7581819cd36d5123ab7571f336753472e3; 14b741a091d7eae2a7b1c27281a9e4417a587f08; 785c1ad8a73864fd3964b97da044a4732da23ec6; 9b5ac14fb06f8ab67aa972674c4738873ac11e80; 25f7719223bcb54c0dafa478f6d73307e9fed007; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; f8342f184985f75b8f903ee45b2d4d87a9469789; d77c47ddc50487a2362e5c27b9ae89a0723f3067; 2c0cdd08a8d3cb834da33515037eafa4bdb5faff; aecc3b421bf4aff3f1743a2f6cfc865203909474; e4700df93db983122fd26ca444d0d0b7fbf1041d; ac2ebdb7fc572b75f4f8a8afb6abd104bb9a233b; e0d5fb21a599b73c56cb9fc1f3cdd8fbcc4640d9; fc708347109c16c96bbc949ffa09092762b0360a; 5684109aa873a00f93168edbfffafd9a4ef4813a; ae118a88ada51dfdb2296cbaa948eb4a467942b6; dc791b8176fee4f218a960990c54946696d6f35d; 30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98; 5fc0543c84367e0ba07b31fca6b0f40452f6963c; c9876704eeaf676f2825e63af570545aa6861361; 86dd743c8408f216a3b40f47a9236872cd433423; 5d6f40938749fd210960d9400e600fe8e73475f2; ad229d6347f9a16005351fef2ad80b50644fd7a1; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 0b346d1b9561f965ca5ba9d3310e19ede6403e86; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f; f30ff56fc607ab1ad1f9dcf17afea7915df446e4; a73932d368f9a4ad68fb558613fd447cba5567b2; 43a4585394e4cb50c365483291a8778b9b29dbda; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b4ee596014935f02d5496146774d2b6caae92ba9; 5e147ca57ea8ba09c571abc2fb75a02724c1b611; 29dbd8dc234de6c86e80f84263d9f18886a240e5; 4e2bd32c389946ee5b292c6fc2e5952c5a518965; 1fd6be476f2d39f71750022b7dee65f6f63f3fe8; b83645410c4b1478ef1e123647fb907278a60748; e9edc04f5e03a6390e9284e0dec8ca60b11c51fd; 7b8471aaa7e055bf7235aad8eb173ed87dced7ac; 9288a36967840d7dfb8b6401420ebb97f590b0c0; 47ea49bccb7765553c51682eeb9529c7cd40792d; be8b5d55d61baae573eea2b5340cd5626e3f1161; 3430c978d3484cc18a115205dc4382920f3defb9; e2a187c6ec22b531a438bfa65b679b9a1a87597d; faba7e21a29fa8f438e8c12bebf6c7bd49b94b3a; 2888f87e01c7adfd95f02c52339a7db8ad329677; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; 9eb659bd6156af45c781316dc1d282b2b36fd536; e85472feaefaa20f00daf5eecfaf170b3217abba; c824343ac540d3bafd7c4eaadb10fb7a1d8e5c76; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; bb3ec2eeb6714de0f3e3632e6dd44810afc193d5; 4031282117fda9326b4d11245bcddc79a50f0eb9; 827656bb3622c867fff708f7f317eee50861e85e; da611b993cf000c8a1ea27f021c720abac0d2aef; 5425f78e0414cd14a467afbfacfa6939c256701b; c849e6b52f562be3dc984196b61114b93516bb8c; 86685c8cecf63c497f858f7d99f45f74b81abc04; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; bfec29dbcc9f950593b477b9c22a6382db24e495; 09e37c45e9a6785280f1abfd66bd59367c6ef53c; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; b9dd05b69d6906fff6ea6c4ba3609a6d97c9b8a3; 7234c244a4e560b44ba2e61768b2d4f5de0d40f9,arXiv: Methodology,,

Studies of the role of dietary factors in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) development have been limited, and no specific dietary factors have been consistently associated with EOC risk.


OBJECTIVE
We used a nutrient-wide association study approach to systematically test the association between dietary factors and invasive EOC risk while accounting for multiple hypothesis testing by using the false discovery rate and evaluated the findings in an independent cohort.


DESIGN
We assessed dietary intake amounts of 28 foods/food groups and 29 nutrients estimated by using dietary questionnaires in the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study (n = 1095 cases). We selected 4 foods/nutrients that were statistically significantly associated with EOC risk when comparing the extreme quartiles of intake in the EPIC study (false discovery rate = 0.43) and evaluated these factors in the NLCS (Netherlands Cohort Study; n = 383 cases). Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs.


RESULTS
None of the 4 dietary factors that were associated with EOC risk in the EPIC study (cholesterol, polyunsaturated and saturated fat, and bananas) were statistically significantly associated with EOC risk in the NLCS; however, in meta-analysis of the EPIC study and the NLCS, we observed a higher risk of EOC with a high than with a low intake of saturated fat (quartile 4 compared with quartile 1; overall HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.41).


CONCLUSION
In the meta-analysis of both studies, there was a higher risk of EOC with a high than with a low intake of saturated fat.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Melissa A Merritt"", ids = ""31511811""); list(name = ""Ioanna Tzoulaki"", ids = ""145781843""); list(name = ""Piet A. van den Brandt"", ids = ""4076706""); list(name = ""Leo J.

d68ab196ab95139d1bf8171fbcde122aa0946d0a,Genome-wide association study in an F2 Duroc x Pietrain resource population for economically important meat quality and carcass traits.,"Meat quality is essential for consumer acceptance, it ultimately impacts pork production profitability and it is subject to genetic control. The objective of this study was to map genomic regions associated with economically important meat quality and carcass traits. We performed a genome-wide association (GWA) analysis to map regions associated with 38 meat quality and carcass traits recorded for 948 F2 pigs from the Michigan State University Duroc Ã— Pietrain resource population. The F0, F1, and 336 F2 pigs were genotyped with the Illumina Porcine SNP60 BeadChip, while the remaining F2 pigs were genotyped with the GeneSeek Genomic Profiler for Porcine Low Desnisty (LD) chip, and imputed with high accuracy ( = 0.97). Altogether the genomic dataset comprised 1,019 animals and 44,911 SNP. A Gaussian linear mixed model was fitted to estimate the breeding values and the variance components. A linear transformation was performed to estimate the marker effects and variances. Type I error rate was controlled at a False Discovery Rate of 5%. Seven putative QTL found in this study were previously reported in other studies. Two novel QTL associated with tenderness (TEN) were located on SSC3 [135.6:137.5Mb; False Discovery rate (FDR) < 0.03] and SSC5 (67.3:69.1Mb; FDR < 0.02). The QTL region identified on SSC15 includes Protein Kinase AMP-activated É£ 3-subunit gene (), which has been associated with 24-h pH (pH24), drip loss (DL) and cook yield (CY). Also, novel candidate genes were identified for TEN in the region on SSC5 [A Kinase (PRKA) Anchor Protein 3 (], and for tenth rib backfat thickness (BF10) [Carnitine O-Acetyltransferase ()] on SSC1. The association of gene polymorphisms with pork quality traits has been reported for several pig populations. However, there are no SNP for this gene on the chip used, thus we genotyped the animals for 2 non-synonymous variants ( and ). We then performed a GWA conditioning on the genotype of both SNP and was associated with pH24, DL, protein content (PRO) and CY ( < 0.004) and T30N with Juiciness, TEN, shear force, pH24, PRO, and CY < 0.04). Finally, we performed a GWA conditioning on the genotype of the SNP peak detected in this study, and T30N remained associated only with PRO ( < 0.02). Therefore, in this study we identified 2 novel QTL regions, suggest 2 novel candidate genes, and conclude that other SNP in PRKAG3 or nearby gene(s) explain the observed associations on SSC15 in this population.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""SebastiÃ¡n CasirÃ³"", ids = ""14144754""); list(name = ""Deborah Velez-Irizarry"", ids = ""1405458141""); list(name = ""Catherine W.

6a2ef32aff2d105b217dbaa19a112fe0d287f512,Maternal inheritance of an inactive type III deiodinase gene allele affects mouse pancreatic Î²-cells and disrupts glucose homeostasis.,"Dio3 is the most distal gene of the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 gene locus and is expressed according to parental origin. Dio3 encodes the type 3 deiodinase (D3), a thioredoxin-fold like containing selenoenzyme that inactivates thyroid hormone and dampens thyroid hormone signaling. Here we used heterozygous animals with disruption of the Dio3 gene to study the allelic expression pattern of Dio3 in pancreatic Î²-cells and the metabolic phenotype resulting from its inactivation. Adult heterozygous mice with disruption of the Dio3 gene with maternal inheritance of the inactive Dio3 allele exhibited a total loss of D3 activity in isolated pancreatic islets, approximately 30% reduction in total pancreatic islet area, a marked decrease in insulin2 mRNA and in vivo glucose intolerance. In contrast, inheritance of the inactive Dio3 allele from the father did not affect D3 activity in isolated pancreatic islets and did not result in a pancreatic phenotype. Furthermore, exposure of pancreatic explants, D3-expressing MIN6-C3 cells or isolated pancreatic islets to 100 nM T3 for 24 hours reduced insulin2 mRNA by approximately 50% and the peak of glucose-induced insulin secretion. An unbiased analysis of T3-treated pancreatic islets revealed the down-regulation of 21 gene sets (false discovery rate q value < 25%) involved in nucleolar function and transcription of rRNA, ribonucleotide binding, mRNA translation, and membrane organization. We conclude that the Dio3 gene is preferentially expressed from the maternal allele in pancreatic islets and that the inactivation of this allele is sufficient to disrupt glucose homeostasis by reducing the pancreatic islet area, insulin2 gene expression, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mayrin C.

a32861e267d78bede94909cfd33bfd5bb6c9ca56,Differential gene expression in human hepatocyte cell lines exposed to the antiretroviral agent zidovudine,"Zidovudine (3â€²-azido-3â€²-deoxythymidine; AZT) is the most widely used nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of AIDS patients and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. Previously, we demonstrated that AZT had significantly greater growth inhibitory effects upon the human liver carcinoma cell line HepG2 as compared to the immortalized human liver cell line THLE2. We have now used gene expression profiling to determine the molecular pathways associated with toxicity in both cell lines. HepG2 cells were incubated with 0, 2, 20, or 100Â Î¼M AZT for 2Â weeks; THLE2 cells were treated with 0, 50, 500, or 2,500Â Î¼M AZT, concentrations that were equi-toxic to those used in the HepG2 cells. After the treatment, total RNA was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis. Global analysis of gene expression, with a false discovery rate â‰¤0.01 and a fold change â‰¥1.5, indicated that 6- to 70-fold more genes were differentially expressed in a significant concentration-dependent manner in HepG2 cells when compared to THLE2 cells. Comparative analysis indicated that 7Â % of these genes were common to both cell lines. Among the common differentially expressed genes, 70Â % changed in the same direction, most of which were associated with cell death and survival, cell cycle, cell growth and proliferation, and DNA replication, recombination, and repair. As determined by the uptake of [methyl-3H]AZT, the intracellular levels of total AZT were approximately twofold higher in THLE2 cells than in HepG2 cells. The expression of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT2B7) genes that regulate the metabolic activation and deactivation of AZT, respectively, was increased in HepG2 cells but decreased in THLE2 cells after treatment with AZT. This differential response in AZT metabolism was confirmed by real-time PCR, western blotting, and/or enzymatic assays. These data indicate that molecular pathways involved with cell death and survival, cell cycle, cell growth and proliferation, and DNA replication, recombination, and repair are involved in the toxicities associated with AZT in both human cell lines, and that the difference in expression of TK1 and UGT2B7 in response to AZT treatment in HepG2 cells and THLE2 cells might explain why HepG2 cells are more sensitive than THLE2 cells to the toxicity of AZT.",2013,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""J Fang"", ids = ""123071956""); list(name = ""Tao Han"", ids = ""145421607""); list(name = ""Qiangen Wu"", ids = ""8276636""); list(name = ""Frederick A Beland"", ids = ""144697829""); list(name = ""Ching-wei Chang"", ids = ""47183549""); list(name = ""Lei Guo"", ids = ""143621711""); list(name = ""James C.

The splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) is one of the main genetic elements affecting splicing patterns. Here, we report the results of genome-wide sQTLs across 141 strains of Arabidopsis thaliana with publicly available next generation sequencing datasets. As a result, we found 1,694 candidate sQTLs in Arabidopsis thaliana at a false discovery rate of 0.01. Furthermore, among the candidate sQTLs, we found 25 sQTLs that overlapped with the list of previously examined trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

a722c3d646b88348da49fd2ef68611de23a4db8a,Reconocimiento de redes de genes mediante regresiÃ³n,"Novel strategies are required in order to handle the huge amount of data produced by microarray technologies. To infer gene regulatory networks, the first step is to find direct regulatory relationships between genes building the so-called gene co-expression networks, i.e. it is filling gaps in the metabolic networks. They are typically built using correlation statistics as pairwise similarity measures. Correlation methods are very useful in order to determine whether two genes have a strong global similarity but do not detect local similarities. We propose model trees as a method to identify gene interaction networks. Model trees are very useful techniques to estimate the numerical values for the target genes by linear regression functions. They are very often more precise than linear regression models because they can adjust different linear regressions to separate areas of the search space favoring to infer localized similarities over a more global similarity. While correlationbased methods analyze each pairs of genes, in our approach we generate a single regression tree for each gene from a set of genes, taking the remaining genes as input. Finally, a graph from all the relationships among output and input genes is built taking into account whether the pair of genes is statistically significant. For this reason we apply a statistical procedure to control the false discovery rate. The performance of our approach named RegNet is experimentally tested on the well-known data set Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Furthermore, we analyze a data set from normal and Alzheimer's disease-affected subjects. In this case, our result provide new evidences for the hypothesis that cardiovascular, diabetes type 2 and Alzheimer's disease are linked. The application of information encoded in molecular networks for prognostic purposes is a crucial objective of systems biomedicine. Standard approaches to biomarker discovery are based on the identification of differentially expressed genes. However, it is known that biomarkers may be encoded by genes that are not highly differentially expressed across control and disease patients. Network-based prognostic approaches have not been widely investigated in the cardiovascular research area where the prediction of clinical outcome would represent a significant contribution to translational research. We developed a new supervised prediction method for this prognostic problem based on the discovery of clinically-relevant transcriptional association networks (obtained by RegNet). The new method named SA- TuRNo integrates clinical class-specific networks, and can be applied to other clinical domains. Before analyzing our cardiovascular disease dataset, we tested the usefulness of our approach on a benchmark dataset with control and disease patients. We also compared it to several algorithms to infer transcriptional association networks and classification models. Comparative results provided evidence of the prediction power of our approach. Next, we discovered new models for predicting good and bad outcomes after myocardial infarction. Using blood-derived gene expression data, our models reported areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve above 0.70. Our model could also outperform different techniques based on co-expressed gene modules. We also predicted processes that may represent novel therapeutic targets for heart disease, such as the synthesis of leucine and isoleucine. To conclude, gene association networks provide new insights into underlying molecular mechanisms leading to bad prognosis after Miocardial Infarction and set the basis for potential novel prognostic models in Heart Failure. Finally, the integration of huge databases with searching techniques in order to automatically validate results from different sources is a key factor in bioinformatics. Several tools have been developed for analysing geneenrichment in terms. Most of them are Gene Ontology-based tools, i.e., these analyse gene-enrichment in GO annotations. In this work, we introduce a software tool, named CarGene (Characterisation of Genes), that helps scientists to validate sets of genes by using the biological knowledge on metabolic pathways stored in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (Kegg), and providing a friendly graphical environment to analyse and compare results generated by different clustering and/or biclustering techniques. CarGene is based on the degree of coherence of genes in (bi)clusters with respect to metabolic pathways of organisms stored in Kegg, and provides an estimate of obtaining results by chance, including two statistical corrections (Bonferroni, andWestfall and Young). One of the most important features of CarGene is the possibility of simultaneously comparing and statistically analysing the information about many groups of genes in both visual and textual manner. Furthermore, it includes its own web browser to explore in detail the information extracted from Kegg.",2011,Biology,"list(name = ""Isabel Nepomuceno Chamorro"", ids = ""3776678"")",ad4aca7bea5dffb51fdef075d79d462c4dea8541,,,,
5794914572ec7012e1e3bb4dfb0d31de6c976f7d,Knockoff filter-based feature selection for discrimination of non-small cell lung cancer in CT image,"Lung cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide and the classification of different types of lung cancers in computed tomography (CT) images is also one of the most significant issues in computer-aided diagnosis. It remains a tough task since various image features could be extracted from one single image while part of the features is irrelevant to the final diagnosis results. In this study, a knockoff filter-based approach is proposed to produce the optimal feature set and to minimise the irrelevancy of the output features for the classification of lung cancer in CT images. The proposed feature selection strategy not only can generate the optimal feature subset but also constrain the false discovery rate of the irrelevant features under a specified parameter setting. Ten-fold leave-one-out cross-validation and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve are both adopted in the experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The areas under curve of 0.86 Â± 0.02 is achieved when the support vector machine classifier is trained on the features determined by the proposed feature selection strategy. The experimental results demonstrate that the presented approach is potentially valuable for lung cancer diagnosis.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Xiaomei Li"", ids = ""37778688""); list(name = ""Xiaopeng Dong"", ids = ""46966258""); list(name = ""Jian Lian"", ids = ""144563421""); list(name = ""Yan Zhang"", ids = ""41196672""); list(name = ""Jinming Yu"", ids = ""81962282"")",a5621d94f53fc2b7bc6464de65e18d3cfd9c11ae,,Iet Image Processing,13,543-548

However, great mutational heterogeneity is observed both across cancer types (>1000â€‰fold) and with a given cancer type, with a fraction of them harbour >10 mutations per Mb, thus termed hypermutation. Hypermutated patients are suitable for PD-1 blockade with favourable prognosis. Nevertheless, other omics such as transcriptome and methylome in hypermutated samples remain poorly understood. Here, we try to determine the genome-wide effects of high mutation loads on transcriptome and methylome across two cancer types, namely colorectal cancer (CRC) and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). Methods All tumour mRNA expression datasets (RNASeqV2) and DNA methylation data (HumanMethylation450) were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Known batch effects were corrected using the ComBat function implemented in the Bioconductor sva package. Differentially expressed gene (DEGs, false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P-value<0.05â€‰and fold change >2 ) analysis between hypermutated and non-hypermutated was performed by DEGSeq package for R/Bioconductor. Significantly differentially methylated site (DMS, FDR adjusted P-value<1E-20 and beta value change >0.2) was performed by limma package for R/Bioconductor. Results Most hypermutated cases were driven by microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). Meanwhile, 935 and 1,047 DEGs and 1604 and 53 DMSs were identified in CRC and STAD (hypermutated vs. non-hypermutated), respectively. A well-conceived five-gene signature (DNAI2, EPHA5, GAS2L1, RNH1, TAGLN3) was identified that could predict prognosis of STAD hypermutated patients with high performance (C-index: 0.84). Additionally, hierarchical clustering of expression and methylation profiles show that majority of CRC and STAD hypermutated samples were mixed and separated from their respective non-hypermutated samples, exceeding the boundary of tissue-specificity. Further in-detail exploration uncovered that the underlying molecular mechanism was related to perturbation of chromatin remodelling genes (ARID1A, NCOR1, and MLL1 ~ 4) both in CRC and STAD hypermutated samples. Conclusions We thus concluded that MSI-H->chromatinâ€‰remodelling genes inactivation->DNAâ€‰methylation/expression variation axis shared in hypermutated samples was responsible for the consistent expression and methylation patterns across cancer types.",2018,,"list(name = ""Wangxiong Hu"", ids = ""3508171"")",,,Gut,67,A4

Following on these observations, we further assessed the link between the AURKA-HMMR-TPX2-TUBG1 functional module and risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers. Forty-one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 15,252 BRCA1 and 8,211 BRCA2 mutation carriers and subsequently analyzed using a retrospective likelihood approach. The association of HMMR rs299290 with breast cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers was confirmed: per-allele hazard ratio (HR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.15, p = 1.9 x 10(-4) (false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p = 0.043). Variation in CSTF1, located next to AURKA, was also found to be associated with breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers: rs2426618 per-allele HR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.16, p = 0.005 (FDR-adjusted p = 0.045). Assessment of pairwise interactions provided suggestions (FDR-adjusted pinteraction values > 0.05) for deviations from the multiplicative model for rs299290 and CSTF1 rs6064391, and rs299290 and TUBG1 rs11649877 in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Following these suggestions, the expression of HMMR and AURKA or TUBG1 in sporadic breast tumors was found to potentially interact, influencing patients' survival. Together, the results of this study support the hypothesis of a causative link between altered function of AURKA-HMMR-TPX2-TUBG1 and breast carcinogenesis in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ignacio Blanco"", ids = ""151441969""); list(name = ""Karoline B Kuchenbaecker"", ids = ""4993313""); list(name = ""Daniel Cuadras"", ids = ""113964305""); list(name = ""Xianshu Wang"", ids = ""4397462""); list(name = ""Daniel Barrowdale"", ids = ""6718883""); list(name = ""Gorka RuÃ­z de Garibay"", ids = ""112904417""); list(name = ""Pablo Librado"", ids = ""2963563""); list(name = ""Alejandro SÃ¡nchez-Gracia"", ids = ""1398910540""); list(name = ""Julio Rozas"", ids = ""143947027""); list(name = ""Nuria Bonifaci"", ids = ""35142148""); list(name = ""Lesley McGuffog"", ids = ""48531905""); list(name = ""V.

b9c729d3eb43cfda61e4d88550132b945b011926,Plasma sphingolipids associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease phenotypes.,"RATIONALE
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occurs in a minority of smokers and is characterized by intermittent exacerbations and clinical subphenotypes such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Although sphingolipids as a class are implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD, the particular sphingolipid species associated with COPD subphenotypes remain unknown.


OBJECTIVES
To use mass spectrometry to determine which plasma sphingolipids are associated with subphenotypes of COPD.


METHODS
One hundred twenty-nine current and former smokers from the COPDGene cohort had 69 distinct sphingolipid species detected in plasma by targeted mass spectrometry. Of these, 23 were also measured in 131 plasma samples (117 independent subjects) using an untargeted platform in an independent laboratory. Regression analysis with adjustment for clinical covariates, correction for false discovery rate, and metaanalysis were used to test associations between COPD subphenotypes and sphingolipids. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used to test associations between sphingolipid gene expression and plasma sphingolipids.


MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS
Of the measured plasma sphingolipids, five sphingomyelins were associated with emphysema; four trihexosylceramides and three dihexosylceramides were associated with COPD exacerbations. Three sphingolipids were strongly associated with sphingolipid gene expression, and 15 sphingolipid gene/metabolite pairs were differentially regulated between COPD cases and control subjects.


CONCLUSIONS
There is evidence of systemic dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism in patients with COPD. Subphenotyping suggests that sphingomyelins are strongly associated with emphysema and glycosphingolipids are associated with COPD exacerbations.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Russell P.

f8991ba851a267f6787c8a98dfba411e46676646,Epidemiological Characterization of a Directed and Weighted Disease Network Using Data From a Cohort of One Million Patients: Network Analysis,"Background In the past 20 years, various methods have been introduced to construct disease networks. However, established disease networks have not been clinically useful to date because of differences among demographic factors, as well as the temporal order and intensity among disease-disease associations. Objective This study sought to investigate the overall patterns of the associations among diseases; network properties, such as clustering, degree, and strength; and the relationship between the structure of disease networks and demographic factors. Methods We used National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) data from the Republic of Korea, which included the time series insurance information of 1 million out of 50 million Korean (approximately 2%) patients obtained between 2002 and 2013. After setting the observation and outcome periods, we selected only 520 common Korean Classification of Disease, sixth revision codes that were the most prevalent diagnoses, making up approximately 80% of the cases, for statistical validity. Using these data, we constructed a directional and weighted temporal network that considered both demographic factors and network properties. Results Our disease network contained 294 nodes and 3085 edges, a relative risk value of more than 4, and a false discovery rate-adjusted P value of <.001. Interestingly, our network presented four large clusters. Analysis of the network topology revealed a stronger correlation between in-strength and out-strength than between in-degree and out-degree. Further, the mean age of each disease population was related to the position along the regression line of the out/in-strength plot. Conversely, clustering analysis suggested that our network boasted four large clusters with different sex, age, and disease categories. Conclusions We constructed a directional and weighted disease network visualizing demographic factors.

7dbca5bb34c8b4f86dde6e20d566c7a6c7b4b767,Impact of the cryopreservation technique and vascular bed on ovarian tissue transplantation in cynomolgus monkeys,"PurposeThe aim of this study was to determine the best combination in terms of cryopreservation techniques and vascular bed preparation before grafting in order to obtain functional ovarian tissue after transplantation.MethodsFive cynomolgus monkeys were used. Strips from 10 ovaries were cryopreserved, 5 by vitrification (V), and 5 by slow-freezing (SF). Pieces of fresh ovarian tissue were used for controls. After 1Â month, the strips were autografted to two different vascular beds, healed (HB) or freshly decorticated (FDB), constituting four study groups: SF-HB, SF-FDB, V-HB, and V-FDB. These were compared to fresh tissue. After 6Â months, the ovaries were removed and several parameters analyzed: follicle quality, stage, density, proliferation, apoptosis, functionality, vascularization, and fibrosis. Mixed effect linear regression models were built to assess the impact of cryopreservation and vascular bed preparation on ovarian tissue viability and functionality. p values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, and q valuesâ€‰<â€‰0.20 were considered significant in order to achieve a 20Â % false discovery rate.ResultsCompared to fresh tissue, no difference was observed in the percentage of morphologically normal follicles, while a significant increase was noted in the follicle proliferation rate (41Â %, qâ€‰=â€‰0.19), percentage of antral follicles (12Â %, qâ€‰=â€‰0.14), and number of vessels per area (3.3 times, qâ€‰=â€‰0.07) in the V-FDB group.ConclusionsVitrification associated with FDB vascular bed preparation is the best combination to obtain functional autografted ovarian tissue. Further studies are nevertheless required, with confirmed pregnancies and live births before introducing the procedure into clinical practice.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""M-M Dolmans"", ids = ""6200103""); list(name = ""MarÃ­a Mercedes Binda"", ids = ""4950056""); list(name = ""Sophie Jacobs"", ids = ""29718937""); list(name = ""J.

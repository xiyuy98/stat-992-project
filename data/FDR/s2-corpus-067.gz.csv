2fbf012ce319ddf28ab1e1f07b679c65ce739c24,Extracting replicable associations across multiple studies: Empirical Bayes algorithms for controlling the false discovery rate,"In almost every field in genomics, large-scale biomedical datasets are used to report associations. Extracting associations that recur across multiple studies while controlling the false discovery rate is a fundamental challenge. Here, we propose a new method to allow joint analysis of multiple studies. Given a set of p-values obtained from each study, the goal is to identify associations that recur in at least k > 1 studies while controlling the false discovery rate. We propose several new algorithms that differ in how the study dependencies are modeled, and compare them and extant methods under various simulated scenarios. The top algorithm, SCREEN (Scalable Cluster-based REplicability ENhancement), is our new algorithm that works in three stages: (1) clustering an estimated correlation network of the studies, (2) learning replicability (e.g., of genes) within clusters, and (3) merging the results across the clusters. When we applied SCREEN to two real datasets it greatly outperformed the results obtained via standard meta-analysis. First, on a collection of 29 case-control gene expression cancer studies, we detected a large set of consistently up-regulated genes related to proliferation and cell cycle regulation. These genes are both consistently up-regulated across many cancer studies, and are well connected in known gene networks. Second, on a recent pan-cancer study that examined the expression profiles of patients with and without mutations in the HLA complex, we detected a large active module of up-regulated genes that are both related to immune responses and are well connected in known gene networks. This module covers thrice more genes as compared to the original study at a similar false discovery rate, demonstrating the high power of SCREEN. An implementation of SCREEN is available in the supplement.",2017,Biology; Mathematics; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""David Amar"", ids = ""144099455""); list(name = ""Ron Shamir"", ids = ""1723209""); list(name = ""Daniel Yekutieli"", ids = ""2398627"")",dabb2d0beef245f1c21789bc1386f2a158a7e4e0; b30ef6d39c299568d63d5b14a17183fbde643964; cb9759ccb8f643ad473ca1074af05b935f3b314b; 4ad56f90d935a1c9cd4380fb1a15f17c8e1a052e,c0d361344070a3d739f8d67e418f34805cd557b7; 988dcf79f4f6fc3ab388bff29ace77da4edd995b; 388b57e58d69b67fcc47b771b2ff7c00ccd28bd4; 7b17ab03214fb73a627982156bb1ffcf3652ad2f; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; 3acd41eeafe82b68094fdf0a487d8781b01fb790; 3209b7e1dde59a28b7452e19b884d45ccb1bc704; 1823026160626ed2cd47de840d3829a7bb2ebb38; f5c19314c9d1d48e8c1c28d823a6b8bf03c727fe; fa8094496c415216f76c685d28b4cc7832eb6588; 100958c808b7109593d14bcc577f4abe4163e4f9; 14ec81e5cedf3eb950054f6d7bfce134f2beac72; 6e71451b5380528ac7b36da7285616e90e32a724; ecd106603d06539df2a95b6e31d935ed8dbc45b4; ee98c051d3dc3721a5e09f2da6aaa3ec6450ebf0; 6f7c4b5dba6e92339fae4c92ceb81d93c191b4bc; bf64fe0b51a3968717ef59e13bd92e33d64e115d; fd3d628f90e73744621c26421869d90e7eddeb3f; 8e46ff6c5fa533ea3e0e4faf1bba7387a13dbb0e; ba7684a2a2b46a1ed9fc5bc0d18bda2de4eb455e; 1d5ff03d8fa2c2255bc79248d1c2bca3caf79a0b; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc; 0cb64a5dc4b4ebca3a3e1d3d50c4ae74ce7c5af2; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; fde12e0b207bcd0ee820f4645d63132458bafdbd; 065216b473e94affbe20cd1003e1c3d6a080cef5; ab020221cab8457456c584981a0c018c4a863796; 2249ea630e56e4991aa157ad9aea65262efe4562; 71039c4545cee4df3a690cc4778a59b75e91d1bb; 217aba004977480711b1c181861e3924398296e9; 9771d2df7eb353df6db994223a46a911f91bbeb1; f7c0b68feb0e7662d7540605e1a0768d5183e9d0; 9eb8ae39a3f7788a0fbc9b16c48de4489e5b952f; 1c78c1879b3ad206073adebd03005240c7c6278a,PLoS Computational Biology,13,
45bee4a2c8a9d0a2a0c3e3e3bed62a8bb57c2c1f,Combining Test Statistics and Information Criteria for High Dimensional Data Integration,"This research is focused on high dimensional data integration by combing test statistics or information criteria. Our research contains four projects. In the first project, we propose an integration method to perform hypothesis testing and biomarkers selection based on multi-platform data sets observed from normal and diseased populations. The types of test statistics can vary across the platforms and their marginal distributions can be different. The observed test statistics are aggregated across different data platforms in a weighted scheme, where the weights take into account different variabilities possessed by test statistics. The overall decision is based on the empirical distribution of the aggregated statistic obtained through random permutations. In both simulation studies and real biological data analyses, our proposed method has better control over false discovery rates and higher positive selection rates than the uncombined method. In mixed data clustering project, we propose a non-parametric clustering method for handling mixed data with both continuous and discrete random variables. The product space of the continuous and discrete sample space is transformed into a new product space ii based on adaptive quantization on the continuous part. Cluster patterns are detected locally by using a weighted modified Chi-squared test. Results from simulation studies and real data analysis have shown that our method out-performs the benchmark method, AutoClass, in various settings. In the multiple data sets model selection project, we propose weighted integrative AICs as a model selection criterion. Our method combines AICs with different weights across multiple data sets. The weights are chosen to minimize the variance of integrative AICs. In the simulation studies, we compare our method with individual AIC method and integrative AICs with equal weights method. Our method has the better performance over false negative numbers and false detected numbers of the selected variables. In the last project, we extend Linharts and Shirmodarias test statistics under composite likelihood function with local alternatives for correlated data set. Comparing to first order method, our simulation results show that our second order method improves the accuracy for estimating the variance of difference of AICs and reduces the error probability when conduct model comparison test.",2015,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yawen Xu"", ids = ""50125896"")",379518151b405572482161ba624aca7bda32bf12,6ebe48ed146345d5505ed4d988dd15343edc8cbb; dcad5a366a332061b3fdda8b7849bee09024e433; 8e055c46c78ca7df9af63a32816ea1eef067064a; 9d454c56e92465da0e18b6203711b624abb6c3af; 595c86bf6cb4ee56c20012dbf72d02d4ba7982f6; 5c6163d2616d208dcf79f0fc63b0a27b83221c7a; d07bb0c66b6ddac2fd0c1c01bd115b552f8ae33e; 683cac1c5a3683d419b8a689232be7fb60d177b5; 629de9ed4ac59f7def6b4d5690030afa4886ead0; d7c9878fd37e2f97f9df6c7c317726419a72ace4; e1314a4444f4ba922acbe18e30f5e428ac611c30; 0bae7b6da551f42174f1e22bf9561ebcbdc686bb; 63dd331d6d5fa03cd44e186af77906bad4e28bb4; c305e124fac1ea643c171ec6f034c7d1d97722aa; 2ed6dd1b0407942c791fe521f1c36844646f56b6; dbe98bfe7ba15aba561fb1322401af0485f55a56; ca097155934e8eed360295d21e44cafb0c0d38ec; c29d80d53a2cd6137a8b6d49a0af7d37951ed00d; 8bf730243ed967afd5349bef053641a6043517a0; 433fde545da1598ae995340e7469bf82e10be07d; 1d7b5498f869fd6891d39cc9a316a80e0ea90056; 17d3d4d68d86c9c972ea1b2788143f3392fe5ac8; c6e853814144e7143bebbfb959ade941b2e27583; 68b9440d326d3d8d049fb8b0df95e36c26d4be24; c564aa7639a08c280423489e52b6e32055c9aa7f; f6dbd99a87d00f739a81928932eadb094207eab0; 42f75b297aed474599c8e598dd211a1999804138; 2c9bb30a136e7970ab1505039222b3ff33ddd7ce; 28d89b941cefaeeb7e7af8a5ea4f9153bbb43bff; 7fc44b7f5b5c495e595245f79cb387332bf0efdf; 94d6a5ed17042dfac7a756202bfb019ff84080fb; be60b1f21a3f6404558a66b2d11a2015ffa39a08; 338092b7c90f3c6c03dfe52db4ecf58bd23d3a22; 613b0e8d43a563899539da67a7fd5406558d0459; 49409df130f420165422e5ba0798d31e76e9a870; 2b5db2ef319226e1a019c10bd17af0c283b56cf7; 53581339c13536b1baf0a1ca48ee5fa7857614ef; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; c054360ec3ccadae977fdd0d77694c9655478a41; 4c9915936ee46e3e2c8331c823d44b3b741e6ac8; cea20f62b4f430b8d5ef4ae9d6718cdb01cbc184; 0ad9f3c2baf70d1fdfdfa4688b46a0c660888dbe; 7fc9cb7dea2e7185d03421a1ff5492d36a2a751b; d2d758b667092bb483c18cd86e661460b84386cb; 44b51eb3c84afcdfd23e5353b9a0432096ab50a1; db6a2232f2804cd3d4a9cf3424e2d7392905b56c; bdfab1ebbc0846aef1aa42a7b5112bf3f181cbf3; 39030851a7b1068ef916fe1196f5c1e9b66428a5; 1b688a2191c5ddd02d7b2bb828255a57d2f50ef4; d49b166f8c11dabebedb85339d8b8620af18efc4; 290e05d21ee1cee068d1917e1dc2068af9d3b5b1; f68cafeae5527cd686dac1064feac6b41ad981ce,,,
f77d7a997010fd0b73ff9dc384581cbb4959ebdb,Gene-specific DNA methylation profiles and LINE-1 hypomethylation are associated with myocardial infarction risk,"BackgroundDNA methylation profiles are responsive to environmental stimuli and metabolic shifts. This makes DNA methylation a potential biomarker of environmental-related and lifestyle-driven diseases of adulthood. Therefore, we investigated if white blood cellsâ€™ (WBCs) DNA methylation profiles are associated with myocardial infarction (MI) occurrence.Whole-genome DNA methylation was investigated by microarray analysis in 292 MI cases and 292 matched controls from the large prospective Italian European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort (EPICOR study). Significant signals (false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) were replicated by mass spectrometry in 317 MI cases and 262 controls from the Dutch EPIC cohort (EPIC-NL). Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) methylation profiles were also evaluated in both groups.ResultsA differentially methylated region (DMR) within the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 12 (ZBTB12) gene body and LINE-1 hypomethylation were identified in EPICOR MI cases and replicated in the EPIC-NL sample (ZBTB12-DMR meta-analysis: effect sizeâ€‰Â±â€‰seâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.016â€‰Â±â€‰0.003, 95Â % CIâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.021;âˆ’0.011, Pâ€‰=â€‰7.54â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’10; LINE-1 methylation meta-analysis: effect sizeâ€‰Â±â€‰seâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.161â€‰Â±â€‰0.040, 95Â % CIâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.239;âˆ’0.082, Pâ€‰=â€‰6.01â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’5).Moreover, cases with shorter time to disease had more pronounced ZBTB12-DMR hypomethylation (meta-analysis, men: effect sizeâ€‰Â±â€‰seâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.0059â€‰Â±â€‰0.0017, PTRENDâ€‰=â€‰5.0â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’4; women: effect sizeâ€‰Â±â€‰seâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.0053â€‰Â±â€‰0.0019, PTRENDâ€‰=â€‰6.5â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’3) and LINE-1 hypomethylation (meta-analysis, men: effect sizeâ€‰Â±â€‰seâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.0010â€‰Â±â€‰0.0003, PTRENDâ€‰=â€‰1.6â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’3; women: effect sizeâ€‰Â±â€‰seâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.0008â€‰Â±â€‰0.0004, PTRENDâ€‰=â€‰0.026) than MI cases with longer time to disease.In the EPIC-NL replication panel, DNA methylation profiles improved case-control discrimination and reclassification when compared with traditional MI risk factors only (net reclassification improvement (95Â % CI) between 0.23 (0.02â€“0.43), Pâ€‰=â€‰0.034, and 0.89 (0.64â€“1.14), Pâ€‰<â€‰1â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’5).ConclusionsOur data suggest that specific methylation profiles can be detected in WBCs, in a preclinical condition, several years before the occurrence of MI, providing an independent signature of cardiovascular risk. We showed that prediction accuracy can be improved when DNA methylation is taken into account together with traditional MI risk factors, although further confirmation on a larger sample is warranted.

0ce8ffcfbc82dada6cd012c18cf068dfcd184d3b,Gene expression profile in circulating mononuclear cells after exposure to ultrafine carbon particles.,"CONTEXT
Exposure to particulate matter (PM) is associated with systemic health effects, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms are unclear.


OBJECTIVE
We hypothesized that, if circulating mononuclear cells play an important role in mediating systemic effects of PM, they would show gene expression changes following exposure.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Peripheral blood samples were collected before (0 h) and at 24 h from healthy subjects exposed to filtered air (FA) and ultrafine carbon particles (UFPs, 50 microg/m(3)) for 2 h in a previous study (n = 3 each). RNA from mononuclear cell fraction (> 85% lymphocytes) was extracted, amplified and hybridized to Affymetrix HU133 plus 2 microarrays. Selected genes were confirmed in five additional subjects from the same study.


RESULTS
We identified 1713 genes (UFP 24 h vs. FA 0 and 24 h, P < 0.05, false discovery rate of 0.01). The top 10 upregulated genes (fold) were CDKN1C (1.86), ZNF12 (1.83), SRGAP2 (1.82), FYB (1.79), LSM14B (1.79), CD93 (1.76), NCSTN (1.70), DUSP6 (1.69), TACC1 (1.68), and H2AFY (1.68). Upregulation of CDKN1C and SRGAP2 was confirmed by real-time-PCR. We entered 1020 genes with a ratio >1.1 or <-1.1 into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and identified pathways related to inflammation, tissue growth and host defense against environmental insults, such as, insulin growth factor 1 signaling, insulin receptor signaling and NF-E2-related factor-2-mediated oxidative stress response pathway.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Two-hour exposures to UFP produced gene expression changes in circulating mononuclear cells. These gene changes provide biologically plausible links to PM-induced systemic health effects, especially those in the cardiovascular system and glucose metabolism.",2010,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Y T Huang"", ids = ""8932093""); list(name = ""Michael T.

1b1cc3bc420421e95b06b06d757724d70cd8b0ae,A breast cancer risk haplotype in the caspase-8 gene.,"Recent large-scale studies have been successful in identifying common, low-penetrance variants associated with common cancers. One such variant in the caspase-8 (CASP8) gene, D302H (rs1045485), has been confirmed to be associated with breast cancer risk, although the functional effect of this polymorphism (if any) is not yet clear. In order to further map the CASP8 gene with respect to breast cancer susceptibility, we performed extensive haplotype analyses using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) chosen to tag all common variations in the gene (tSNP). We used a staged study design based on 3,200 breast cancer and 3,324 control subjects from the United Kingdom, Utah, and Germany. Using a haplotype-mining algorithm in the UK cohort, we identified a four-SNP haplotype that was significantly associated with breast cancer and that was superior to any other single or multi-locus combination (P=8.0 x 10(-5)), with a per allele odds ratio and 95% confidence interval of 1.30 (1.12-1.49). The result remained significant after adjustment for the multiple testing inherent in mining techniques (false discovery rate, q=0.044). As expected, this haplotype includes the D302H locus. Multicenter analyses on a subset of the tSNPs yielded consistent results. This risk haplotype is likely to carry one or more underlying breast cancer susceptibility alleles, making it an excellent candidate for resequencing in homozygous individuals. An understanding of the mode of action of these alleles will aid risk assessment and may lead to the identification of novel treatment targets in breast cancer.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Neil Shephard"", ids = ""48765044""); list(name = ""Ryan Abo"", ids = ""2373282""); list(name = ""Sushila Harkisandas Rigas"", ids = ""38708015""); list(name = ""Bernd Frank"", ids = ""47206210""); list(name = ""Wei-Yu Lin"", ids = ""46639803""); list(name = ""Ian Wallace Brock"", ids = ""37648656""); list(name = ""Adam Shippen"", ids = ""10268529""); list(name = ""Sabapathy P Balasubramanian"", ids = ""145075256""); list(name = ""Malcolm W.

5c31860d99b6f30c58d7872b6ecd1b755770b9b1,"Metabolic profiles of male meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans from the EPIC-Oxford cohort12","BACKGROUND
Human metabolism is influenced by dietary factors and lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors; thus, men who exclude some or all animal products from their diet might have different metabolic profiles than meat eaters.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed to investigate differences in concentrations of 118 circulating metabolites, including acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, hexose, and sphingolipids related to lipid, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism between male meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans from the Oxford arm of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition.


DESIGN
In this cross-sectional study, concentrations of metabolites were measured by mass spectrometry in plasma from 379 men categorized according to their diet group. Differences in mean metabolite concentrations across diet groups were tested by using ANOVA, and a false discovery rate-controlling procedure was used to account for multiple testing. Principal component analysis was used to investigate patterns in metabolic profiles.


RESULTS
Concentrations of 79% of metabolites differed significantly by diet group. In the vast majority of these cases, vegans had the lowest concentration, whereas meat eaters most often had the highest concentrations of the acylcarnitines, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids, and fish eaters or vegetarians most often had the highest concentrations of the amino acids and a biogenic amine. A clear separation between patterns in the metabolic profiles of the 4 diet groups was seen, with vegans being noticeably different from the other groups because of lower concentrations of some glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids.


CONCLUSIONS
Metabolic profiles in plasma could effectively differentiate between men from different habitual diet groups, especially vegan men compared with men who consume animal products.

a492a12b899a187165e9ef71dcdc6a7c3fd71343,M11: Assessing the Role of Long Noncoding Rnas (lncrnas) in Autism Spectrum Disorders,"Background The contribution of non-coding genomic elements remains largely unexplored in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized for their role in transcription regulation, and likely contribute to transcriptome dysregulation in ASD. Methods We are applying a combination of short-read and long-read RNA-Seq, with and without lncRNA capture to unveil the role of lncRNAs in ASD. As lncRNAs are poorly represented in standard RNA-Seq experiments, we used capture RNA-Seq (Capture-Seq) to quantify lncRNA expression in postmortem prefrontal cortex and cerebellum tissues in a cohort of 40 ASD and controls. We additionally combined full-length (PacBio) isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) with capture (Capture-IsoSeq) to build a comprehensive map of brain-expressed lncRNAs. Results The enrichment by Capture-Seq increased the lncRNA fraction of our RNA-Seq datasets from 5% to 57%. We identified 28 differentially expressed (false discovery rate (FDR) Discussion Our Capture enriched sequencing approaches substantially improved our ability to profile lncRNA expression and reconstruct poorly annotated lncRNA isoforms. We have identified many DE lncRNA/TUCP transcripts in a cohort of 40 ASD and controls from two different brain regions as a key step towards understanding the role of lncRNAs in ASD etiology.",2019,Psychology,"list(name = ""Nancy Francoeur"", ids = ""4546655""); list(name = ""Michael J.

First, a new class of data-driven weighting procedures, incorporating group structure and true null proportion estimators, is defined, and its False Discovery Rate (FDR) control is proven asymptotically. This procedure also achieves power optimality under some conditions on the proportion estimators. Secondly, new step-up and step-down procedures, tailored for discrete tests under independence, are designed to control the FDR for arbitrary p-value null marginals. Finally, new confidence bounds for post hoc inference (called post hoc bounds), tailored for the case where the signal is localized, are studied, and the associated optimal post hoc bounds are derived with a simple algorithm.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Guillermo AndrÃ©s Durand"", ids = ""77212328"")",,,,,
70b138c71256416c2b881b27e5d082b98382e4de,Comparison of Machine Learning Methods With National Cardiovascular Data Registry Models for Prediction of Risk of Bleeding After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention,"Importance
Better prediction of major bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may improve clinical decisions aimed to reduce bleeding risk. Machine learning techniques, bolstered by better selection of variables, hold promise for enhancing prediction.


Objective
To determine whether machine learning techniques better predict post-PCI major bleeding compared with the existing National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) models.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This comparative effectiveness study used the NCDR CathPCI Registry data version 4.4 (July 1, 2009, to April 1, 2015), machine learning techniques were used (logistic regression with lasso regularization and gradient descent boosting [XGBoost, version 0.71.2]), and output was then compared with the existing simplified risk score and full NCDR models. The existing models were recreated, and then performance was evaluated through additional techniques and variables in a 5-fold cross-validation in analysis conducted from October 1, 2015, to October 27, 2017. The setting was retrospective modeling of a nationwide clinical registry of PCI. Participants were all patients undergoing PCI. Percutaneous coronary intervention procedures were excluded if they were not the index PCI of admission, if the hospital site had missing outcomes measures, or if the patient underwent subsequent coronary artery bypass grafting.


Exposures
Clinical variables available at admission and diagnostic coronary angiography data were used to determine the severity and complexity of presentation.


Main Outcomes and Measures
The main outcome was in-hospital major bleeding within 72 hours after PCI. Results were evaluated by comparing C statistics, calibration, and decision threshold-based metrics, including the F score (harmonic mean of positive predictive value and sensitivity) and the false discovery rate.


Results
The post-PCI major bleeding rate among 3â€¯316â€¯465 procedures (patients' median age, 65 years; interquartile range, 56-73 years; 68.1% male) was 4.5%. The existing full model achieved a mean C statistic of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.78-0.78). The use of XGBoost and full range of selected variables achieved a C statistic of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.82-0.82), with an F score of 0.31 (95% CI, 0.30-0.31). XGBoost correctly identified an additional 3.7% of cases identified as high risk who experienced a bleeding event and an overall improvement of 1.0% of cases identified as low risk who did not experience a bleeding event. The data-driven decision threshold helped improve the false discovery rate of the existing techniques. The existing simplified risk score model improved the false discovery rate from more than 90% to 78.7%. Modifying the model and the data decision threshold improved this rate from 78.7% to 73.4%.


Conclusions and Relevance
Machine learning techniques improved the prediction of major bleeding after PCI. These techniques may help to better identify patients who would benefit most from strategies to reduce bleeding risk.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bobak J.

Exploratory biomarkers associated with inflammation, bone erosion, and cardiovascular (CV) risk were evaluated in this study. Objectives To compare the effects of sarilumab monotherapy vs adalimumab monotherapy on circulating biomarkers associated with acute-phase response (CRP, serum amyloid A [SAA]), bone resorption (RANKL and osteoprotegerin [OPG]), and CV risk (lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)]) in patients from MONARCH. Methods Sera were analyzed at baseline and posttreatment through wk 24 from patients who consented to biomarker analyses and received SC sarilumab 200 mg q2w (N=153) or adalimumab 40 mg q2w (N=154). Biomarkers were assessed using validated ELISAs. Nonparametric methods were used to evaluate differences in the percent change from baseline in biomarker levels between treatments at each time point. Percent change from baseline in biomarkers at wk 24 was also compared, separately by treatment group, between ACR50 responders and nonresponders at wk 24. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to correct P values for multiplicity and control false discovery rate. Significance level was P<0.05. Results A significant difference in RANKL was observed at wks 2 and 24 between sarilumab and adalimumab groups (P<0.0001; Table). Numerically, RANKL decreased after sarilumab and increased after adalimumab treatment. Significantly greater reductions in Lp(a), SAA, and CRP were observed at wks 12 and 24 after treatment with sarilumab vs adalimumab. The difference in OPG between groups was significant at wk 2 only. Table 1. Median Percent Change From Baseline in Serum Concentrations of Circulating Biomarkers At wk 24, change in OPG, RANKL, and Lp(a) did not differ between ACR50 responders and nonresponders at wk 24 in either treatment group. Responders in both groups demonstrated greater reductions vs nonresponders in CRP (sarilumab, -95.8% vs -87.3%; adalimumab, -47.6% vs -6.4%; all P<0.01); a trend was observed for SAA (sarilumab, -92.3% vs -73.2%; adalimumab, -33.0% vs 0.0%; unadjusted P<0.05, not significant after adjustment). Conclusions Sarilumab monotherapy significantly suppressed bone-resorptive and CV risk markers to a greater degree than adalimumab monotherapy. Reductions in CRP were significantly different in ACR50 responders vs nonresponders after either treatment. Analyses to assess predictive and prognostic effects of biomarkers (including markers of myeloid and lymphoid synovial phenotypes) are ongoing.

In exposed workers, screening of early cancer-related markers provides important information to identify individuals at risk. Here, we aimed to elucidate the associations between PAH exposure and serum levels of cancer-related proteins in 118 chimney sweeps and 126 occupationally unexposed controls, all non-smoking males from Sweden. Monoydroxylated metabolites of pyrene, phenanthrene, benzo[a]pyrene, and benzo[a]anthracene were measured in urine using LC/MS/MS and 90 cancer-related proteins were measured in serum using a Proximity Extension Assay. Linear regression analysis adjusted for age, BMI, and false discovery rate (FDR) identified 17 serum proteins that were differentially expressed (16 upregulated and 1 downregulated) in chimney sweeps compared with controls (FDR<0.05). Concentrations of the peptidase kallikrein 13 (KLK13) showed significant positive associations with urinary concentrations of the PAH metabolites 3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene (B, 95%CI: 0.042, 0.008-0.076) and 3-hydroxybenzo[a]anthracene (B, 95%CI: 0.068, 0.002-0.134). Moreover, dose-response relationships were observed between KLK13 and 3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene (trend test P=0.027) and 3-hydroxybenzo[a]anthracene (P=0.035). Pathway and gene ontology analyses showed that cell movement, cell adhesion, and cell migration were the predominant molecular functions associated with the top differentially expressed proteins. In conclusion, we found a number of putative cancer-related proteins differentially expressed in workers exposed to PAH. This warrants effective measure to reduce PAH exposure among workers as well as further investigation to confirm these findings.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ayman Alhamdow"", ids = ""3681894""); list(name = ""HÃ¥kan Tinnerberg"", ids = ""4583138""); list(name = ""Christian H Lindh"", ids = ""1851019""); list(name = ""Maria Albin"", ids = ""144062489""); list(name = ""Karin Broberg"", ids = ""46372046"")",4499d4038394aa559765f3b4d541f28524c8274d; 13fab70764ac7f8ae2d01679d9b74269185769f8,2b15c487e6eb96394a50446f461489fa0ec2e632; 4cdd487076f8932ed369db489c4b7b0afd616078; 0a6322d767af08fe9b66b40477c1b233f4803271; 41651d61c98504684645fd9110a70c3a013b86aa; c2a5cb5268dd9bcb90edb81f65e44a6baf795e42; a889b5e470a3ef0a0c31c2635a7a8622d56b0d98; 610e0bbf652cc2b45bda5f44f9e9dfc20248c652; 9b2c908f6365cf028978ff85f28f1540b1e08060; b1e8803302241239af7eea3d71608ee72e7595f1; 47757f386a35d0a9b32e962fdc36e5bfa0ae858f; 9cdea027b828de525c876ede01988ea09d0ebab7; 2abbd7640646faa3173aa5448580ecf9bb0cc8a0; 0ca4c0aa00f81e7e979edbadf3b94ce9b9c2ff87; 00aaa2d8dc47921eca3854c03fa7133c24452909; db792f50d8737e16aa88296ef3c755b464ae871b; 94527228ce3fdaf1c9c4bff87b6ef268011aa666; eb64ea97f672f5a787d8c06ee928d7b76e63ad94; 55044a5ba2ede93dea08be8ddc53dc4b65e2cfd1; f0fd586bc1ddf7dd5ea0512c62237c4ccebdfee5; 3802567985f3823a0cedfa5967d136946fd0adad; 71964d5c7e7d89b5edce4b6874fa9a80a843bc9b; 5ca628df34b126104a6fd1d018209f3bc1a0d58c; 596f9277d54e67559acc65e0ea8580b83f91f2cd; 6bb185f21b8676ebd60e86213bfbd1cfd190be20; 6368ab4539ef9840dc7f44880089cad946d1578d; c6758ffa7b04971c74da1a78041ff34a695b808d; 3dbb8c571998f9da1e6e8de6381c2ef474445d24; dce014fbbb1c9fccb23d8e8ddbf988b08e7dcaeb; c98b9c06bce523d9c18c5a9d3dd5007f568c2493; d0747d460d19c4db45d6ff02edc8caec45ef03b3; a0798fd96adcf0a6c2a546e85ea9187fc8b13d7b; 088a7a46a4bb2f941eb400b3ba5bef055c6e875d; 195f08098689f7732b91343f465f6dbc5bcaa1f3; 1714827ec0c9051b4ff647e81525f3cf40ee287c; d902e896019a96efc05ae57f2cce12aeb160559f; 087b7c9c0253168d52f3f0cf315ef8e1e1a9c352; d5c3b7ee610ab629cf495ee2405a2457386aacb6; 8eba3521a30a702d47ec345edc84d2a6ec2f51c9; e40e556e43674399459f1c42afb216afb6068317; b31bc8eb6ab324a8eac11d4282b09b0ad1f0b49d; c4fb98f237b67abc401081d9cd9d06a413d21b8b; dc085ed880916780ac01cfea9f172176d70bdc03; bc6e8aad34d351e6d017b8278d6b53e625f26934; e3a212225600ce666284336ce3e7b88412695770; 6061de6307501de81e92ff28b51ab9b1f2ac1049; e44b0de8dce943475de1957462b832f0b54bc79b; 55fe00631b806277f43c7547acad1961453872ed; ef84806613cb18720f33cd8401ee797073406c23; 57d80c7cd8aa89fa08e06b3b22620506320627c6; 7fcff720e5a1a24800499d7d4e9433a83f301b4c; 441831bb1212bcec982023d5e94b3153c79254b7; 55dddf70f4b737f88e08afaadcc968f9859dc98a; d1fe4b29ef5aeb586442614ee5ded649b6e692e6; bd2db590a7aca82a4714fab575d1f4a3298bffbe; f142a841ce3066dc0ff4a58b66be6c6e1c9c98d5; a233cda42c1d867af55ee6fce51d2e1b731cbfb5,Carcinogenesis,40,771 - 781
d72e7856154e1f48377dbd93f4392891715db7f8,Plasma metabolite abundances are associated with urinary enterolactone excretion in healthy participants on controlled diets.,"Enterolignans, products of gut bacterial metabolism of plant lignans, have been associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases, but their association with other plasma metabolites is unknown. We examined plasma metabolite profiles according to urinary enterolignan excretion in a cross-sectional analysis using data from a randomized crossover, controlled feeding study. Eighty healthy adult males and females completed two 28-day feeding periods differing by glycemic load, refined carbohydrate, and fiber content. Lignan intake was calculated from food records using a polyphenol database. Targeted metabolomics was performed by LC-MS on plasma from fasting blood samples collected at the end of each feeding period. Enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol, were measured in 24 h urine samples collected on the penultimate day of each study period using GC-MS. Linear mixed models were used to test the association between enterolignan excretion and metabolite abundances. Pathway analyses were conducted using the Global Test. Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) was used to control for multiple testing. Of the metabolites assayed, 121 were detected in all samples. ENL excretion was associated positively with plasma hippuric acid and melatonin, and inversely with epinephrine, creatine, glycochenodeoxycholate, and glyceraldehyde (P < 0.05). Hippuric acid only satisfied the FDR of q < 0.1. END excretion was associated with myristic acid and glycine (q < 0.5). Two of 57 pathways tested were associated significantly with ENL, ubiquinone and terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis, and inositol phosphate metabolism. These results suggest a potential role for ENL or ENL-metabolizing gut bacteria in regulating plasma metabolites.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Fayth L Miles"", ids = ""145679764""); list(name = ""Sandi L Navarro"", ids = ""6594087""); list(name = ""Yvonne Schwarz"", ids = ""49544961""); list(name = ""Haiwei Gu"", ids = ""144059994""); list(name = ""Danijel Djukovic"", ids = ""5271282""); list(name = ""Timothy W.

A single dose of diclofenac at 9.5 mg/kg or 0.95 mg/kg body weight was given orally, and the liver samples were obtained after 6, 24, and 72 h. Histopathologic studies enabled the classification of the diclofenac effect into injury (6, 24 h) and recovery (72 h) stages. By using the Applied Biosystems Mouse Genome Survey Microarray, a total of 7370 out of 33,315 (22.1%) genes were found to be statistically reliable at p<0.05 by two-way ANOVA, and 602 (1.8%) probes at false discovery rate <5% by Significance Analysis of Microarray. Among the statistically reliable clones by both analytical methods, 49 genes were differentially expressed with more than a 1.625-fold difference (which equals 0.7 in log(2) scale) at one or more treatment conditions. Forty genes and two genes were identified as injury- and recovery-specific genes, respectively, showing that most of the transcriptomic changes were seen during the injury stage. Furthermore, multiple genes involved in oxidative stress, eicosanoid synthesis, apoptosis, and ATP synthesis showed variable transcript levels upon acute diclofenac administration.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Heekyoung Chung"", ids = ""39931234""); list(name = ""Hyun Jun Kim"", ids = ""93316707""); list(name = ""Ki-Seok Jang"", ids = ""77353529""); list(name = ""Mingoo Kim"", ids = ""2377113""); list(name = ""Jungeun Yang"", ids = ""3646551""); list(name = ""Ju Han Kim"", ids = ""14834398""); list(name = ""Yong-Sung Lee"", ids = ""1775381""); list(name = ""Gu Kong"", ids = ""38189249"")",d899982a428c4482810413ba384e872e72543ee6; c54642255820a09a2d1d44ed8cfecc687e70587c; c2d2a73d0afe58adcd91f8299e21efd3758b7223; e077002ec22c95156ef58464ccb04996fd474238; 76394b635939cc1cb8a763adc8de6db19bdee114; 989bab16b70dcea56ead51cc51d12a3194cba533; 7850622546e0586c32950ca8e5dec956f909a935; f657d9197ddf93c6dd9e1186ea14cc8bf8b90e42; 47f641630453baa68078ef389010120657163f3e; ce414bcb6caaf9a2d0a5468b39e6b977a9439609; 7743d5ce0e1356897c9b7ddad5e2e9a38dfcb248,b4dbf6747d3c70546d1cb7b0375fc8e8c30809bb; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; 4df1ee2955b90258c8aeb25d032c71c4c21e042f; 55ba24705cd768ccfbbab910b3b64b9869510f61; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; d60b752faeef6bf909e353b9f28629ba086a6287; 61d1fbb3365595a8d798a016bcc3c2655ed74e5f; adcb919b17f62c91d16544ea0d7db2bfdc30c3dc; 3b32cb4f639dc62d1bb894d18a6f168a1abec07c; e68e8d8f9eb4f15f80c75835ff8059ccb287e06d; eae97fb7c27ecafa785bc67dce5c0a9f211c3bb4; 78c07e7d0a8b7c7ac6c2cd03ced10cdbf655c9df; a73cfbfe876726f4131dc32a00346479456a4de2; 414afab26ab37aeb1c455e744aea98c090ec1fc4; 4b3bcd5e317e48b34b23a9a7aae003a9ea6cf866; 24653f359c8065e74d1ab2b038d77fdb99a9647e; b5ea67a377df84d3a8b8d188d1022c01fcc9be26; 7fcb7aa44f5aa9ca39dd5eab625a1f8addfcf442; db49e2f987fe81dd47119ecf4de03c7d9bd5e3de; 76823bfff5740885673e0f9ccf851e8b5b366a3f; 1085508e56cf03ce67b60c0bc2fcd1a46a8864a2; c18cc1162160358c93d8abbf7d588b3944ee866c; 51f16b8b7fc48db3f11f2d51ddc3e8ba66f63863; e0f7c1efa9d691b227ebfd3bf3316776d44b2cdd; 4e30f15536eed290f9152634d1e8edb29899b831; ccea618f9a2851e33398de395c4fc27d2ef982aa; 9bc67db777efd5cc84e7b3247b623a2fcd583229; da4fb2e4522a277320264211f213c450a4977b2a; 460bc5461711b9dec056438a9197c4565bcc8cfb; 5721e6b1b047875031eee65a44346f744fd4c919; 4b9f4d032402bb52a05183fd4d3035be2e454af6; 832a66c61ec4d90a8492a632f23cf8e266ca04ce; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; b3c86c1466f42f3a9838952ea814a9823a0c9161; 5dc6e3c14fa606f61d79f1387e179d9917dd20ae; 37c2f613658f6d53742e46b3fc5b8cd802c334c1; 4f7014201f2318f97208a7eec116f6d15dc07408; 72c6672c6c9e036e63d95a6bd959863e48ffdbab; aa48a893b905e07c3a4cd6f38b69ea9b499aa42e,Toxicology letters,166 1,"

558a9a30642f411f78f55e34ce125164e370d942,Differential splicing analysis based on isoforms expression with NBSplice.,"Alternative splicing alterations have been widely related to several human diseases revealing the importance of their study for the success of translational medicine. Differential splicing (DS) occurrence has been mainly analyzed through exon-based approaches over RNA-seq data. Although these strategies allow identifying differentially spliced genes, they ignore the identity of the affected gene isoforms which is crucial to understand the underlying pathological processes behind alternative splicing changes. Moreover, despite several isoform quantification tools for RNA-seq data have been recently developed, DS tools have not taken advantage of them. Here, the NBSplice R package for differential splicing analysis by means of isoform expression data is presented. It estimates differences on relative expressions of gene transcripts between experimental conditions to infer changes in gene alternative splicing patterns. The developed tool was evaluated using a synthetic RNA-seq dataset with controlled differential splicing. NBSplice accurately predicted DS occurrence, outperforming current methods in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, F-score, and false discovery rate control. The usefulness of our development was demonstrated by the analysis of a real cancer dataset, revealing new differentially spliced genes that could be studied pursuing new colorectal cancer biomarkers discovery.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Gabriela Alejandra Merino"", ids = ""1490745191""); list(name = ""Elmer AndrÃ©s FernÃ¡ndez"", ids = ""1490742886"")",,,Journal of biomedical informatics,,"

708321ed7e3ff576c0de916c3bf70e73dedca205,Accurate read-based metagenome characterization using a hierarchical suite of unique signatures,"A major challenge in the field of shotgun metagenomics is the accurate identification of organisms present within a microbial community, based on classification of short sequence reads. Though existing microbial community profiling methods have attempted to rapidly classify the millions of reads output from modern sequencers, the combination of incomplete databases, similarity among otherwise divergent genomes, errors and biases in sequencing technologies, and the large volumes of sequencing data required for metagenome sequencing has led to unacceptably high false discovery rates (FDR). Here, we present the application of a novel, gene-independent and signature-based metagenomic taxonomic profiling method with significantly and consistently smaller FDR than any other available method. Our algorithm circumvents false positives using a series of non-redundant signature databases and examines Genomic Origins Through Taxonomic CHAllenge (GOTTCHA).

f290d23d38df7152faa3bc692fb68fdf4c98c3ef,Promoter methylation of serotonin transporter gene is associated with obesity measures: a monozygotic twin study,"Objective:Epigenetic mechanisms are increasingly being recognized as an important factor for obesity. The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) has a critical role in regulating food intake, body weight and energy balance. This study examines the potential association between SLC6A4 promoter methylation and obesity measures in a monozygotic (MZ) twin sample.Methods:We studied 84 MZ twin pairs drawn from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Obesity measures include body mass index (BMI), body weight, waist circumference (WC) and waist-hip ratio (WHR). The SLC6A4 promoter methylation profile in peripheral blood leukocytes was quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing. The association between methylation variation and obesity parameters was examined by mixed-model regression and matched pair analysis, adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity and total daily energy intake. Multiple testing was controlled using the adjusted false discovery rate (q-value).Results:Mean methylation level was positively correlated with BMI (r=0.29; P=0.0002), body weight (r=0.31; P<0.0001) and WC (r=0.20; P=0.009), but not WHR. Intra-pair differences in mean methylation were significantly correlated with intra-pair differences in BMI, body weight and WC, but not WHR.

681d5b1139cf2b1d5d19fcde4621607eaef33e82,Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in selected cytokine genes and risk of adult glioma.,"A role of immunological factors in glioma etiology is suggested by reports of an inverse relationship with history of allergy or autoimmune disease. To test whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes were related to risk of adult glioma, we genotyped 11 SNPs in seven cytokine genes within a hospital-based study conducted by the National Cancer Institute and an independent, population-based study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (overall 756 cases and 1190 controls with blood samples). The IL4 (rs2243248, -1098T>G) and IL6 (rs1800795, -174G>C) polymorphisms were significantly associated with risk of glioma in the pooled analysis (P trend = 0.006 and 0.04, respectively), although these became attenuated after controlling for the false discovery rate (P trend = 0.07 and 0.22, respectively). Our results underscore the importance of pooled analyses in genetic association studies and suggest that SNPs in cytokine genes may influence susceptibility to glioma.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Alina V.

36946a7d347b413162556f6a7bcb89db209338cc,A semi-nonparametric mixture model for selecting functionally consistent proteins,"BackgroundHigh-throughput technologies have led to a new era of proteomics. Although protein microarray experiments are becoming more common place there are a variety of experimental and statistical issues that have yet to be addressed, and that will carry over to new high-throughput technologies unless they are investigated. One of the largest of these challenges is the selection of functionally consistent proteins.ResultsWe present a novel semi-nonparametric mixture model for classifying proteins as consistent or inconsistent while controlling the false discovery rate and the false non-discovery rate. The performance of the proposed approach is compared to current methods via simulation under a variety of experimental conditions.ConclusionsWe provide a statistical method for selecting functionally consistent proteins in the context of protein microarray experiments, but the proposed semi-nonparametric mixture model method can certainly be generalized to solve other mixture data problems.

6136d8d0640b3d5e949a386c63a3908b93ff4bc5,Enhancing the detection of barcoded reads in high throughput DNA sequencing data by controlling the false discovery rate,"BackgroundDNA barcodes are short unique sequences used to label DNA or RNA-derived samples in multiplexed deep sequencing experiments. During the demultiplexing step, barcodes must be detected and their position identified. In some cases (e.g., with PacBio SMRT), the position of the barcode and DNA context is not well defined. Many reads start inside the genomic insert so that adjacent primers might be missed. The matter is further complicated by coincidental similarities between barcode sequences and reference DNA. Therefore, a robust strategy is required in order to detect barcoded reads and avoid a large number of false positives or negatives.For mass inference problems such as this one, false discovery rate (FDR) methods are powerful and balanced solutions. Since existing FDR methods cannot be applied to this particular problem, we present an adapted FDR method that is suitable for the detection of barcoded reads as well as suggest possible improvements.ResultsIn our analysis, barcode sequences showed high rates of coincidental similarities with the Mus musculus reference DNA. This problem became more acute when the length of the barcode sequence decreased and the number of barcodes in the set increased. The method presented in this paper controls the tail area-based false discovery rate to distinguish between barcoded and unbarcoded reads. This method helps to establish the highest acceptable minimal distance between reads and barcode sequences. In a proof of concept experiment we correctly detected barcodes in 83% of the reads with a precision of 89%. Sensitivity improved to 99% at 99% precision when the adjacent primer sequence was incorporated in the analysis. The analysis was further improved using a paired end strategy. Following an analysis of the data for sequence variants induced in the Atp1a1 gene of C57BL/6 murine melanocytes by ultraviolet light and conferring resistance to ouabain, we found no evidence of cross-contamination of DNA material between samples.ConclusionOur method offers a proper quantitative treatment of the problem of detecting barcoded reads in a noisy sequencing environment. It is based on the false discovery rate statistics that allows a proper trade-off between sensitivity and precision to be chosen.",2013,Medicine; Computer Science; Biology,"list(name = ""Tilo Buschmann"", ids = ""40303570""); list(name = ""Rong Zhang"", ids = ""145814758""); list(name = ""Douglas E.

We hypothesized that gene expression during Aspergillus colonization could provide clues to CLAD pathogenesis.We examined transcriptional profiles in 3- or 6-month surveillance bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cell pellets from recipients with Aspergillus fumigatus colonization (n = 12) and without colonization (n = 10). Among the Aspergillus colonized, we also explored profiles in those who developed CLAD (n = 6) or remained CLAD-free (n = 6). Transcription profiles were assayed with the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray (Affymetrix). Differential gene expression was based on an absolute fold difference of 2.0 or greater and unadjusted P value less than 0.05. We used NIH Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery for functional analyses, with false discovery rates less than 5% considered significant.Aspergillus colonization was associated with differential expression of 489 probe sets, representing 404 unique genes. ""Defense response"" genes and genes in the ""cytokine-cytokine receptor"" Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway were notably enriched in this list. Among Aspergillus colonized patients, CLAD development was associated with differential expression of 69 probe sets, representing 64 unique genes. This list was enriched for genes involved in ""immune response"" and ""response to wounding"", among others. Notably, both chitinase 3-like-1 and chitotriosidase were associated with progression to CLAD.Aspergillus colonization is associated with gene expression profiles related to defense responses including cytokine signaling. Epithelial wounding, as well as the innate immune response to chitin that is present in the fungal cell wall, may be key in the link between Aspergillus colonization and CLAD.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Stephen S.

c6b22951cd55583b6dc3e7f6b4e09e51759ace4d,Contribution of airway eosinophils in airway wall remodeling in asthma: Role of MMP-10 and MET.,"BACKGROUND
Eosinophils play an important role in the pathophysiology of asthma being implicated in airway epithelial damage and airway wall remodeling. We determined the genes associated with airway remodeling and eosinophilic inflammation in patients with asthma.


METHODS
We analyzed the transcriptomic data from bronchial biopsies of 81 patients with moderate-to-severe asthma of the U-BIOPRED cohort. Expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix arrays on total RNA. Transcription binding site analysis used the PRIMA algorithm. Localization of proteins was by immunohistochemistry.


RESULTS
Using stringent false discovery rate analysis, MMP-10 and MET were significantly overexpressed in biopsies with high mucosal eosinophils (HE) compared to low mucosal eosinophil (LE) numbers. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed increased expression of MMP-10 and MET in bronchial epithelial cells and in subepithelial inflammatory and resident cells in asthmatic biopsies. Using less-stringent conditions (raw P-valueÂ <Â 0.05, log2 fold changeÂ >Â 0.5), we defined a 73-gene set characteristic of the HE compared to the LE group. Thirty-three of 73 genes drove the pathway annotation that included extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, mast cell activation, CC-chemokine receptor binding, circulating immunoglobulin complex, serine protease inhibitors, and microtubule bundle formation pathways. Genes including MET and MMP10 involved in ECM organization correlated positively with submucosal thickness. Transcription factor binding site analysis identified two transcription factors, ETS-1 and SOX family proteins, that showed positive correlation with MMP10 and MET expression.


CONCLUSION
Pathways of airway remodeling and cellular inflammation are associated with submucosal eosinophilia. MET and MMP-10 likely play an important role in these processes.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chih-Hsi Scott Kuo"", ids = ""33769628""); list(name = ""Stelios Pavlidis"", ids = ""34335382""); list(name = ""Jie Zhu"", ids = ""39738015""); list(name = ""Matthew J Loza"", ids = ""4236778""); list(name = ""Fred Baribaud"", ids = ""12469334""); list(name = ""A Rowe"", ids = ""143619813""); list(name = ""Ioannis Pandis"", ids = ""37886773""); list(name = ""David S Gibeon"", ids = ""4626867""); list(name = ""Uruj Hoda"", ids = ""15824080""); list(name = ""Ana Sousa"", ids = ""1851848""); list(name = ""Susan J.

Additionally, we examined whether phytoestrogen levels modify the association of ODC-polyamine pathway SNPs and risk of gastric cancer. Materials and Methods: Twenty-five SNPs in five genes were genotyped in 59 incident gastric cancer cases and 175 matched controls recruited from the Korea Multi-Center Cancer Cohort. Candidate genes were selected based on genotype databases, and genotype assay was performed using Goldengate platform (Illumina). We calculated the unadjusted Wald p-value between each SNP and phytoestrogen level, as well as the false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-values of the 25 SNPs according to each phytoestrogen biomarker. Unconditional logistic regression model was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI for smoking history. Results: There was a significant association for NQO1 (rs1800566, rs1437135) and daidzein, AMD1 (rs1279599, rs7768897, rs811921) and equol, AMD1 (rs1279599, rs7768897, rs811921) and enterolactone (FDR p-value Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

We perform two simulation studies to demonstrate important factors in replication assignment, sample size calculation and difference detection.

af2a8675a1c160c17d66a0fb2a22a210d6d7eabe,Multiple Testing of Composite Null Hypotheses in Heteroscedastic Models,"In large-scale studies, the true effect sizes often range continuously from zero to small to large, and are observed with heteroscedastic errors. In practical situations where the failure to reject small deviations from the null is inconsequential, specifying an indifference region (or forming composite null hypotheses) can greatly reduce the number of unimportant discoveries in multiple testing. The heteroscedasticity issue poses new challenges for multiple testing with composite nulls. In particular, the conventional framework in multiple testing, which involves rescaling or standardization, is likely to distort the scientific question. We propose the concept of a composite null distribution for heteroscedastic models and develop an optimal testing procedure that minimizes the false nondiscovery rate, subject to a constraint on the false discovery rate.

LabVIEW based on an SVM model is proposed in this paper to get the best SVM parameters using the hybrid CS and PSO method. PCA is used as a preprocessor of SVM for reducing the dimension of data and extracting features of training samples. Also, SVM parameters are optimized for Parkinson's disease data by combining CS and PSO. The designed system is used to determine the best SVM parameters, and it is compared to PSO and CS optimization methods and found that the used CS-PSO hybrid optimization method is better. The hybrid model shows that the accuracy of the performance achieved is 97.4359%.

The molecular underpinnings of the dissociation of cognitive performance and neuropathological burden are poorly understood, and there are currently no known genetic or epigenetic determinants of the dissociation.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
""Residual cognition"" was quantified by regressing out the effects of cerebral pathologies and demographic characteristics on global cognitive performance proximate to death. To identify genes influencing residual cognition, we leveraged neuropathological, genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data available for deceased participants of the Religious Orders Study (n = 492) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (n = 487). Given that our sample size was underpowered to detect genome-wide significance, we applied a multistep approach to identify genes influencing residual cognition, based on our prior observation that independent genetic and epigenetic risk factors can converge on the same locus. In the first step (n = 979), we performed a genome-wide association study with a predefined suggestive p < 10-5, and nine independent loci met this threshold in eight distinct chromosomal regions. Three of the six genes within 100 kb of the lead SNP are expressed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC): UNC5C, ENC1, and TMEM106B. In the second step, in the subset of participants with DLPFC DNA methylation data (n = 648), we found that residual cognition was related to differential DNA methylation of UNC5C and ENC1 (false discovery rate < 0.05). In the third step, in the subset of participants with DLPFC RNA sequencing data (n = 469), brain transcription levels of UNC5C and ENC1 were evaluated for their association with residual cognition: RNA levels of both UNC5C (estimated effect = -0.40, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.10, p = 0.0089) and ENC1 (estimated effect = 0.0064, 95% CI 0.0033 to 0.0096, p = 5.7 Ã— 10-5) were associated with residual cognition. In secondary analyses, we explored the mechanism of these associations and found that ENC1 may be related to the previously documented effect of depression on cognitive decline, while UNC5C may alter the composition of presynaptic terminals. Of note, the TMEM106B allele identified in the first step as being associated with better residual cognition is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs1990622A (r2 = 0.66), a previously identified protective allele for TDP-43 proteinopathy. Limitations include the small sample size for the genetic analysis, which was underpowered to detect genome-wide significance, the evaluation being limited to a single cortical region for epigenetic and transcriptomic data, and the use of categorical measures for certain non-amyloid-plaque, non-neurofibrillary-tangle neuropathologies.


CONCLUSIONS
Through a multistep analysis of cognitive, neuropathological, genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data, we identified ENC1 and UNC5C as genes with convergent genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic evidence supporting a potential role in the dissociation of cognition and neuropathology in an aging population, and we expanded our understanding of the TMEM106B haplotype that is protective against TDP-43 proteinopathy.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Charles Cody White"", ids = ""48259436""); list(name = ""Hyun-Sik Yang"", ids = ""7543020""); list(name = ""Lei Yu"", ids = ""38590383""); list(name = ""Lori B Chibnik"", ids = ""5027943""); list(name = ""Robert J.

3015815c2e04d26c96c78aa2b73af2ab182db7f5,Methodological aspects of the genetic dissection of gene expression,"MOTIVATION
Dissection of the genetics underlying gene expression utilizes techniques from microarray analyses as well as quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Available QLT mapping methods are not tailored for the highly automated analyses required to deal with the thousand of gene transcripts encountered in the mapping of QTL affecting gene expression (sometimes referred to as eQTL). This report focuses on the adaptation of QTL mapping methodology to perform automated mapping of QTL affecting gene expression.


RESULTS
The analyses of expression data on > 12,000 gene transcripts in BXD recombinant inbred mice found, on average, 629 QTL exceeding the genome-wide 5% threshold. Using additional information on trait repeatabilities and QTL location, 168 of these were classified as 'high confidence' QTL. Current sample sizes of genetical genomics studies make it possible to detect a reasonable number of QTL using simple genetic models, but considerably larger studies are needed to evaluate more complex genetic models. After extensive analyses of real data and additional simulated data (altogether > 300,000 genome scans) we make the following recommendations for detection of QTL for gene expression: (1) For populations with an unbalanced number of replicates on each genotype, weighted least squares should be preferred above ordinary least squares. Weights can be based on repeatability of the trait and the number of replicates. (2) A genome scan based on multiple marker information but analysing only at marker locations is a good approximation to a full interval mapping procedure. (3) Significance testing should be based on empirical genome-wide significance thresholds that are derived for each trait separately. (4) The significant QTL can be separated into high and low confidence QTL using a false discovery rate that incorporates prior information such as transcript repeatabilities and co-localization of gene-transcripts and QTL. (5) Including observations on the founder lines in the QTL analysis should be avoided as it inflates the test statistic and increases the Type I error. (6) To increase the computational efficiency of the study, use of parallel computing is advised. These recommendations are summarized in a possible strategy for mapping of QTL in a least squares framework.

bd53ebf7e28d0ee4d6904be1875c5a931d5b28bf,Some Results on the Control of the False Discovery Rate under Dependence,"Controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) is a powerful approach to multiple testing, with procedures developed with applications in many areas. Dependence among the test statistics is a common problem, and many attempts have been made to extend the procedures. In this paper, we show that a certain degree of dependence is allowed among the test statistics, when the number of tests is large, with no need for any correction. We then suggest a way to conservatively estimate the proportion of false nulls, both under dependence and independence, and discuss the advantages of using such estimators when controlling the FDR.

a449c8ab2a8b40df2ae5c438ef9ec16273b2c609,TDP-43 subtypes are associated with distinct atrophy patterns in frontotemporal dementia,"Background:We sought to describe the antemortem clinical and neuroimaging features among patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 immunoreactive inclusions (FTLD-TDP). Methods:Subjects were recruited from a consecutive series of patients with a primary neuropathologic diagnosis of FTLD-TDP and antemortem MRI. Twenty-eight patients met entry criteria: 9 with type 1, 5 with type 2, and 10 with type 3 FTLD-TDP. Four patients had too sparse FTLD-TDP pathology to be subtyped. Clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging features of these cases were reviewed. Voxel-based morphometry was used to assess regional gray matter atrophy in relation to a group of 50 cognitively normal control subjects. Results:Clinical diagnosis varied between the groups: semantic dementia was only associated with type 1 pathology, whereas progressive nonfluent aphasia and corticobasal syndrome were only associated with type 3. Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease were seen in type 2 or type 3 pathology. The neuroimaging analysis revealed distinct patterns of atrophy between the pathologic subtypes: type 1 was associated with asymmetric anterior temporal lobe atrophy (either left- or right-predominant) with involvement also of the orbitofrontal lobes and insulae; type 2 with relatively symmetric atrophy of the medial temporal, medial prefrontal, and orbitofrontal-insular cortices; and type 3 with asymmetric atrophy (either left- or right-predominant) involving more dorsal areas including frontal, temporal, and inferior parietal cortices as well as striatum and thalamus. No significant atrophy was seen among patients with too sparse pathology to be subtyped. Conclusions:FTLD-TDP subtypes have distinct clinical and neuroimaging features, highlighting the relevance of FTLD-TDP subtyping to clinicopathologic correlation.

a59420cfadb0279396ab7b264f3c4457ca69f553,Leukemia-Related Gene Expression of Bone Marrow Cells from Patients with Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome at the Pre-Leukemic Phase.,"Background: Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is an inherited bone marrow failure disorder characterized by varying degrees of cytopenia and a high propensity for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in up to 36% of the patients by the age of 30 years. Although the gene associated with SDS, SBDS, has recently been identified, its function, the link with MDS/AML and the mechanism for the development of MDS/AML in SDS is unclear and the molecular events occurring during transformation havenâ€™t been yet identified. It is likely that several events occur many years before overt transformation occurs, and might be identifiable by comprehensive analysis. Objectives: To use oligonucleotide microarray to identify leukemogenic gene expression before overt transformation, which can explain a propensity for MDS/AML. Methods: Total RNA from marrow cells from 9 SDS patients and 7 healthy age-matched donors of bone marrows for transplantation was extracted, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix HG_U133_Plus2.0 GeneChip. Data were pre-processed using robust multichip analysis (RMA) and differentially expressed genes were identified with permutation-based methods. False discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-values were used to rank genes and cluster analysis grouped genes and samples. Real-time PCR was performed to confirm differential expression of genes found by microarray. Results: Of the 38,500 genes on the HG_133_Plus2.0 we analyzed 52 known leukemia-related genes. We identified several genes with small FDR-adjusted p-values. Clustering of arrays resulted in two clusters that clearly separated patients from controls. Interestingly among the leukemia-related genes, the most differentially expressed gene (T=4.2) was ARHGEF12, a member of the Rho GEF family. Rho GEFs are oncogenes; many of them can transform NIH 3T3 cells into a malignant phenotype by altering expression and activation of Rho GTPases. ARHGEF12 is mapped at 11q23, telomeric to MLL, and is a novel MLL fusion partner in acute myeloid leukemia. Real time PCR after normalization against beta-actin confirmed statistically higher expression of the ARHGEF12 (p=0.03) in SDS marrow cells. In addition to ARHGEF12, we have found striking expression changes in several other genes, related to MDS/AML including TAL1, whose differential expression was also confirmed by real-time PCR. Conclusions: SDS marrow cells exhibit abnormal gene expression pattern, which might results in continuous stimulation favoring evolution or progression of malignant clones. Additional molecular and cytogenetic events are likely necessary for the malignant process to be irreversible and complete. Although analysis of whole marrow cells may not enable the detection of genes with lower differential expression between SDS and normal, it may still assist identifying molecular pathways involved in leukemogenesis. This is critically important when studying marrow failure disorders as obtaining sufficient amount of RNA from purified cell population is largely impossible.",2005,Biology,"list(name = ""Piya Rujkijyanont"", ids = ""47614764""); list(name = ""Joseph Beyene"", ids = ""47825064""); list(name = ""Kuiru Wei"", ids = ""7677042""); list(name = ""Yigal Dror"", ids = ""31566048"")",4874d71ec8029bb13fd2394255db0ae8ec7ead27,,Blood,106,3433-3433

We retrieved case-control studies from three online databases and applied the statistical approach of meta-analysis for a series of pooling analyses. A total of fourteen case-control studies were included for FCGR2A rs1801274; while thirty-one case-control studies were included for MUC5B rs35705950. No significant difference between pneumonia cases and controls for FCGR2A rs1801274 was found. However, MUC5B rs35705950 was significantly associated with pneumonia susceptibility in the whole population under the genetic models of allelic T vs. G [OR (odds ratio) =3.78], carrier T vs. G (ORâ€‰=â€‰3.31), TT vs. GG (ORâ€‰=â€‰13.66), GT vs. GG (ORâ€‰=â€‰4.78), GTâ€‰+â€‰TT vs. GG (ORâ€‰=â€‰5.05), and TT vs. GGâ€‰+â€‰GT (ORâ€‰=â€‰6.47) (all Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, Bonferroni-adjusted Pâ€‰<â€‰0.006; false discovery rate-adjusted Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0010). Furthermore, we observed a similar positive result for subgroup analyses of â€œCaucasianâ€, â€œAsianâ€, â€œpopulation-based controlâ€, and â€œidiopathic pulmonary fibrosisâ€.

9c1d7ed95838de0e9028341be2298c0cbbb4a3ed,Gene expression profiles predict survival of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancers,"A large variation in prognosis is observed despite the use of clinical prognostic factors in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is likely that this variation is due to the different biological properties of the tumour cells. In this work we aimed to identify gene signature that could predict survival in advanced NSCLC. Total RNA was extracted from five 5 Î¼m-thick sections of the FFPE using the High Pure RNA Paraffin Kit (Roche). RNA amplification was performed using WT-Ovationâ„¢ FFPE RNA Amplification System V2 (NuGen). The amplified cDNA was then labelled and hybridised onto Illumina HumanRef-8 v3.0 Expression BeadChips. Microarray data analysis was subsequently performed using Genespring GX version 9.0. Out of 75 FFPE samples, only 32 had sufficient RNA quality and quantity for microarray gene expression analysis. Patients were grouped into long and short survival groups based on the time to cancer-related death. After normalization and filtration, 19,002 genes were selected for differential gene expression analysis. A total of 440 genes differed significantly between the long and short survival groups (ANOVA, p < 0.05, with Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate multiple testing correction). Unsupervised Hierarchial Clustering with Pearson correlation and average linkage identified two broad clusters of patients corresponding to the long and short survival. Thirteen genes were selected based on the TTest, 2-fold expression changes, principal components analysis and univariate Cox regression analysis and risk scores were calculated for each patient. These gene signatures were independent predictors of survival. The model was validated with a published microarray data from 130 patients with NSCLC. Using Gene Set Analysis (GSA), we found certain biological processes including metastasis and chemotherapy resistance were up-regulated in the short survival group while TID pathway and MAPKKK cascade were enriched in the long survival group.

c8c80209bec9034a46d593865082d0483da37a44,Filtering the rejection set while preserving false discovery rate control.,"Scientific hypotheses in a variety of applications have domain-specific structures, such as the tree structure of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), the directed acyclic graph structure of the Gene Ontology (GO), or the spatial structure in genome-wide association studies. In the context of multiple testing, the resulting relationships among hypotheses can create redundancies among rejections that hinder interpretability. This leads to the practice of filtering rejection sets obtained from multiple testing procedures, which may in turn invalidate their inferential guarantees. We propose Focused BH, a simple, flexible, and principled methodology to adjust for the application of any pre-specified filter. We prove that Focused BH controls the false discovery rate under various conditions, including when the filter satisfies an intuitive monotonicity property and the p-values are positively dependent. We demonstrate in simulations that Focused BH performs well across a variety of settings, and illustrate this method's practical utility via analyses of real datasets based on ICD and GO.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Eugene Katsevich"", ids = ""14144300""); list(name = ""C.

cc0af4cd5db6ceacbcfb4c734d17956093164f4e,Construction and analysis of lncRNA-associated ceRNA network identified potential prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer,"Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as non-coding RNA (ncRNA) with transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides with tissue specificity. Recently it has been found participate in cancer tumorigenesis and progression via transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional regulation and epigenetic gene regulation. Competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis assume that lncRNAs compete the target RNA by sponging the common miRNA response elements (MREs) to complete the posttranscriptional regulation. To explore the function and mechanisms of lncRNAs as ceRNAs in gastric cancer (GC), this study performed a genome-wide analysis. Methods: The lncRNAs, mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) profiles of 375 GC samples and 32 normal samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD) datasets. The data was standardized with a cross match in the miRBase (a database at http://www.mirbase. org/), which made 365 samples as the analysis objects. We identify differentially expressed RNAs (DERNAs), including differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) by applying edge R package with thresholds of |log2FC| >2 and false discovery rate (FDR) Results: The constructed gastric ceRNA network involved 61 mRNAs, 44 lncRNAs and 22 miRNAs. Five lncRNAs out of the DElncRNAs, namely MIR100HG, MAGI2-AS3, AC080038.1, AC010478.1 and MEF2C-AS1, were found mostly involved in the network. The lncRNA AL139147 were detected negatively correlated with overall survival (log-rank, P Conclusions: In conclusion, our study identified promising lncRNAs, which might be potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic targets and contribute to further understanding of the ceRNA pathogenesis in GC and guide for further investigation.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Jingfeng Peng"", ids = ""14782049""); list(name = ""Yimiao Zhu"", ids = ""8246950""); list(name = ""Xin Dong"", ids = ""143805347""); list(name = ""Xiaoming Mao"", ids = ""49723374""); list(name = ""Yanbo Lou"", ids = ""103519933""); list(name = ""Yunchuan Mu"", ids = ""5944019""); list(name = ""Dan Xue"", ids = ""90387122""); list(name = ""Huijiang Zhou"", ids = ""13211462"")",150a98d788c605b31adbe376b1f9b92aeeb9dc98,,Translational cancer research,8,1116-1128

We report here association studies of schizophrenia with three glutamate transporter genes SLC1A1, SLC1A3, and SLC1A6 encoding the glutamate transporters EAAT3, EAAT1, and EAAT4, respectively. We initially performed the screening of the total 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed in the three gene regions using 100 out of 400 Japanese cases and 100 out of 420 Japanese controls. After controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at level 0.05, we observed significant associations of schizophrenia with a genotype of SNP4 (rs2097837, P = 0.007) and with haplotypes of SNP2-SNP5 (P = 7.5 x 10(-5)) and SNP3-SNP5 (P = 9.0 x 10(-4)) in the SLC1A6 region. The haplotype of SNP2-SNP5 of SLC1A6 even showed marginally significant association with the disease in the full-size sample (400 cases and 420 controls, P = 0.031). We concluded that at least one susceptibility locus for schizophrenia may be located within or nearby SLC1A6, whereas SLC1A1 and SLC1A3 are unlikely to be major susceptibility genes for schizophrenia in the Japanese population.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Xiangdong Deng"", ids = ""2643073""); list(name = ""Hiroki Shibata"", ids = ""2981383""); list(name = ""Naoko Takeuchi"", ids = ""4310420""); list(name = ""Shinako Rachi"", ids = ""4585437""); list(name = ""Mayumi Sakai"", ids = ""47991121""); list(name = ""Hideaki Ninomiya"", ids = ""35215264""); list(name = ""Nakao Iwata"", ids = ""4288013""); list(name = ""Norio Ozaki"", ids = ""143653653""); list(name = ""Yasuyuki Fukumaki"", ids = ""6193051"")",a0dadd896605572c9a5cd1f4ca4d3d8e4a53f1d8; efdebc541335820a794cb004a64de65510e63928; 0ff806eb7349ff5e4781f9cbcdea3a7f8e3b7f1b; 120fb39781854fd8e6d118b3b97c2dfbd4445e26; be613014de6b62ed6f348a8c5cfa6a5696288f3c; dade3839bb323e2470755006b0076f361935b965; f5651bd01511f4895ec1ac9f25af3792e8505d81; 9c5c799feeda77bdbee1e654e87542bbeb60a677; cadde4f2d33e3e5b7910284ba031b1cfd43df377; f745890616e98287092833f5ded758e863b1b127; 7e100a7051a351a0a58dd20fd63f4e6f06ad496b; 1147b9331e2bf86c829be0f728b4caee58c89606; a2a5f50c6f2569235cae52c4f57620658c056e71; c6bf2d32c9c2954b7b01ab642581c0635c28022a; 8b34f9f2f31beb0439162a3bb233cdf2b2e9d701; 1c94f87a0d887b65e512adeb7cd135e13e25d1a9; bf15b67856d201a503ccb68dba1fb060e45c29a2; 79d5014ab3c77af8b56bcf898c56df5b323193a2; fa120acb7e32fa6d54e387fb9ad2466d82f48fc2; a02ec0c41494fe4fa8c80fafd786fda09cbe16a3; d2a807ac706cf9742705f2cdfba6ef585c3ce8e2; 72f195040322631df253b1bb4142f9dcf02a4442; fc8386f5370e2894cbbd5f1a75d26e2fb2217932; 5d83aa0dc2ae1a69a25d9541bde5b85c3d3bb61c,,"American journal of medical genetics.

To use independent transcriptomics data sets of cancer patients with prognostic information from public repositories to validate the relevance of our previously described chronic lymphocytic leukemiaÂ (CLL)-related proteins at the level of transcription (mRNA) to the prognosis of CLL.Â Â Methods: This is a validation study that was conducted at Majmaah University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between January-2017 and July-2018. Two independent data sets of CLL transcriptomics from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with time-to-first treatment (TTFT) data (GSE39671; 130 patients) and information about overall survival (OS) (GSE22762; 107 patients) were used for the validation analyses. To further investigate the relatedness of a transcript of interest to other neoplasms, 6 independent data sets of cancer transcriptomics with prognostic information (1865 patients) from the cancer genomics atlas (TCGA) were used. Pathway-enrichment analyses were conducted using Reactome; and correlation analyses of gene expression were performed using Pearson score.Â Results: Nine of the CLL-related proteins exhibited transcript expression that predicted TTFT and 7 of the CLL-related proteins showed mRNA levels that predicted OS in CLL patients (pâ‰¤0.05). Of these transcripts, 8 were different types of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (HNRNPs); and 2 (HNRNPUL2 and HIST1C1H) retained prognostic significance in the 2 independent data sets. Furthermore, genes that enriched CLL-related pathways (pâ‰¤0.05; false discovery rate [FDR] â‰¤0.05) were found to correlate with the expression of HNRNPUL2 (Pearson score: â‰¥0.50; p lessthanÂ 0.00001). Finally, increased expression of HNRNPUL2 was indicative of poor prognosis of various types of cancer other than CLL (p less thanÂ 0.05).Â Conclusion: The cognate transcripts of 14 of our CLL-related proteins significantly predicted CLL prognosis.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Suliman A.

To predict survival outcomes of lung cancer patients, many prognosis gene sets were identified by using gene expression microarrays. However, these gene sets were often inconsistent across independent cohorts. To identify genes with more consistency, we combined gene expression and copy number variations (CNVs). Affymetrix SNP 6.0 and u133plus2.0 microarrays were performed on 42 pairs of lung adenocarcinoma patients. The copy number varied regions (CNVR) existed in more than 30% samples were identified and 475 differentially expressed genes with concordant changes were selected for pathway analysis. Thirteen pathways were significantly enriched among the 475 CNV-associated genes, and survival analyses showed these pathways had generally consistent and significant prediction probabilities across three independent microarray studies. Therefore, integration between gene expression and copy number may help to lower false discovery rate and identify genes used to predict survival outcomes.",2010,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Tzu-Pin Lu"", ids = ""2010228""); list(name = ""Liang-Chuan Lai"", ids = ""1812493""); list(name = ""Chuhsing Kate Hsiao"", ids = ""8319297""); list(name = ""Pei-Chun Chen"", ids = ""49490552""); list(name = ""Mong-Hsun Tsai"", ids = ""2463557""); list(name = ""Eric Y.

70393dfb5f5e76b8dd08f8c2c1ce1f0c97da9866,Proteomic Analysis of Longitudinal Changes in Blood Pressure,"Hypertension is the leading risk factor for premature death worldwide. The identification of modifiable causes of hypertension remains an imperative task. We aimed to investigate associations between 79 proteins implicated in cardiovascular disease and longitudinal blood pressure (BP) changes in three Swedish prospective cohorts. In a discovery phase, we investigated associations between baseline circulating protein levels assessed with a proximity extension assay and BP stage progression at follow-up 5 years later among persons without BP-lowering drugs at baseline in two independent community-based cohorts from the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors study (PIVUS) and the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM). We used an independent cohort, the MalmÃ¶ Diet and Cancer Study (MDC), for replication. The primary outcome of BP stage progression was defined as per the 2017 AHA/ACC (American Heart Association/ American College of Cardiology) Guideline BP categories. We also investigated associations of protein levels with changes in BP on a continuous scale, and meta-analyzed all three cohorts. Levels of renin were associated with BP stage progression with a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) in the ULSAM (n = 238) and PIVUS (n = 566) cohorts, but we could not replicate this association in the MDC cohort (n = 2659). The association in the discovery cohorts was modest, with an odds ratio for BP stage progression over 5 years of 1.33 (95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.56) per standard deviation of baseline renin. In conclusion, we could not find any novel robust associations with longitudinal BP increase in a proximity extension assay-based proteomics investigation in three cohorts.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yi-Ting Lin"", ids = ""92989335""); list(name = ""Tove Fall"", ids = ""65791282""); list(name = ""Ulf Hammar"", ids = ""134820056""); list(name = ""Stefan Gustafsson"", ids = ""49105010""); list(name = ""Erik Ingelsson"", ids = ""2105755""); list(name = ""Johan Ã„rnlÃ¶v"", ids = ""4998047""); list(name = ""Lars Lind"", ids = ""2813823""); list(name = ""Gunnar EngstrÃ¶m"", ids = ""5475375""); list(name = ""Johan SundstrÃ¶m"", ids = ""152364328"")",,fae50ff0af2eed66ac891def0c52742ab05047b9; 1c4f4fe1f361a15304be1d19997750950347a263; 028d7655f29d788c70872d42e9d6346e97ece05d; a233cda42c1d867af55ee6fce51d2e1b731cbfb5; 13f438454e7e71ccfd714e39c8783a1e49ba42ba; 76e38f7b12cae6a78e6324b3dee350ea77f00022; 8384c2c414b42cb2d407209d895c42c27c473ee8; 3e92441b5e6ac5d4d9363b2b185f82daa832aa72; 418eb8c00025f0a4e7a431db2b4b6c7884bbf1cb; 0b3eb19bbc84ddd8b3c18ab86691e154bff121f3; fbacbc3aaa1142f75ec02664f537ed8134ba9c22; 16637b46a2c6eb8584a5e5df9ae739a276e6d8c5; 152ea9494d8931f5da6e632617961a99e3ec63c9; 466a7e13caa776dfe0f47c9f4870564aeb3c3241; 1d49d51d33f4608022cce12b1cc08ad2d6fde370; 51a97dd236b8b50a3b4fa70431073fd64fd409f7; fc11c9d034f48b1bb0244f40b982df91e5085914; 3d85a7557008f62f0d5bac857821f5f2a02bf39d; 5afbd468aa8f95ccd8853cff05880d22655c83e6; 8b8768a9fd27a42808b7d58bfe99361d3ad96e26; 3faff8ece92ead9bc1ee7855e4d412670618aeb1; 4ed718882bcb729e1e9b98f0098ee41a4ee5e946; ebb524761cee40f4109e3a7634a5c83e7c06a75e; f2a3ebfb1c08b5dcefc525fe0efa4987ea8f7cca; 72671b1cc2eb270c4b5cb824a5a4c74e4c0704b1; d0d3c3be2700168d8deb53fa1c93949e42500d14; f2d6b7281c9fc7f265d652a4deb885c8f01e17cd; cc40bbe84dcc42a796c8ce39dfacdf254e638a78; 514d561d6707239a208d983700395898f63cf10f; 6d500b5b727d28e0d835825572cd4d6f424fe211; c540431f471b55ebf4c47a990e0ff6a3a146f92c; 10ec372cbe476566e4b4974334ad3f8cead288d6; 16aa544b902d21a687559bf6d6812bca63a34e1f; d902e896019a96efc05ae57f2cce12aeb160559f; 0e2b8504631d402ae016ff1b345781a1f688f33a; 72fa7f9fc9cc0ebd61f9722530ba23178aa39310; 6837867b7a61d4cd0447296972bbd6fe5194b714; 0119a0941dce2fad2106d1424c923a912c71bf31; ed4125f9afecd1d7ec2136c12324b02a41ca1e08; 678c62f1c6acac0dd794dba7ff93986d91c49e71; f49ad87703c6bef42a95117362e563b62df5e7af; 337a6c4e5aad74a872d3954c2d0a7c647a0677d7; 19a29f79fa676d649ddf4038f199760845a1769a; f83679eacd3a0e482ceffdf26865d22567aac596; 74db8c94fb1037c21f49293d78479f6d46540367; ec0e285ff6ad18f3d738bd1d93b234e77760bd7f; 6831053ac4703b21d1fec66c8c8dfc9c30274362; aca6f5630dffb62a9588886cbf4c9c24ba66e4c8; 0edf59e5246aa156811d20c37e2df1d334f47ec4; f4b72122ae2412ef6364add0145fc0f337e1ddda; e1569dcd27c4b06f170a3df7a6af621de0248930; 69be32c9d116a13571312f00bd8b96b2156016b8; c7d6a36afda333863844b28705033f5d7c3a058c; 131779607212f7c774550d970d46dc2a8ff4f945; 846f808b90cc0ecdbcac289cb0ccedd9ed87138a; 6bb4f5a7e19b2b0af09d8dd7fd0732939f15f0a8; 7b26f6c089d2db6f525202daec7c3eda83420950; 06d0c9fe21d6da63ed48b6981fc83c9d8ea0d216; 21aabe0873e373b3b58db931fd3e778f867dc359; 1679ed4f350208d6876ca62015012549313b9106; 5a93450b0230be32852b5ac7366b564207795b20; 43f229bb068b2162b0824bfb87d20505698dcd05; 96d96da8016e9942db69dd154a0e1b46ed5a95c7; 07427e8ace3d5797a22f217752e62dc082aa0c93; f6fa4e6eddd559ac4f8e77349d924e1e4cc8169c; badbc9b2813ec9acaef455b39894ea7c683cde9e; a5dac8e5b39d8ea4e5ee98fc3f139036682de73c; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f6dd766e73301faf0ff5fd47bfc09b41c12bff30; f555f0e2d505ca2a7e3d4a0957ab300e7ab8c7e1,Journal of Clinical Medicine,8,
28ecd7d33bb331767d05d2ca47f85613b8426834,Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics Reveals Distinct Immunoglobulin Light Chain Variable Region Usage In Systemic Versus Localized AL Amyloidosis,"Background Immunoglobulin light chain-associated amyloidosis (AL) is caused by deposition of immunoglobulin light chain molecules with unique, clonotypic variable (V) regions. Detection and identification of the V region, however, has been challenging due heterogeneity inherent in V regions. We developed a new method for detecting IGKV and IGLV region fragments in AL deposits using protein mass spectrometry and novel bioinformatics approach. We report distinct IGKV and IGLV usage in localized versus systemic AL.

Methods Shotgun protein mass spectrometry on amyloid plaques was performed as previously described (Blood. 2009; 114: 4957-9). Peptide tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) were searched against a composite sequence database containing SwissProt's human complete proteome augmented with 1764 IG V region sequences obtained from ImMunoGeneTics database and a Mayo Clinic internal database. Reversed sequences were appended to the database for estimating identification false discovery rates (FDRs). Peptide identifications were processed with Scaffold software. Confident protein identifications (probability > 0.9) with at least one unique peptide identifications and five MS/MS matches were considered. Detected variable gene family (if any) with most number of peptide and spectral matches is considered to be present in the deposit. The method was first validated in 8 cases of AL amyloidosis with known IGKV and IGLV region sequences and then applied on 1238 systemic and 393 localized AL cases. Differences between groups were measured by generating hypergeometric p-values.

Results In all 8 AL cases with known IGKV and IGLV region usage, gene family identified in the AL deposit via proteomics matched the gene family inferred from bone marrow plasma cells by Sanger sequencing of IGLC genes.

Armed with this method, we analyzed the amyloid proteomics data from 1238 patients with systemic AL amyloidosis and 393 patients with localized AL amyloidosis. The anatomical site distribution in systemic cohort was 296 GI tract, 364 heart, 225 kidney, 81 liver and 272 fat aspirate; Localized cohort has 78 bladder, 158 lung and 157 skin cases. [Figure 1][1] shows the normalized frequency of the variable gene families detected between the systemic and localized AL amyloidosis. For AL-kappa, KV1 was more prevalent in systemic cases when compared to localized cases (p=7.2E-12) suggesting KV1 clones as a hallmark for systemic AL-kappa amyloidosis. KV3 was more frequently seen in localized AL-kappa cases when compared to systemic AL-kappa cases (p =2.8E-11). For AL-lambda, LV1 and LV2 gene families were more prevalent in localized cases when compared to systemic cases (p= 0.039 and 2.7E-05). LV6 was more prevalent in systemic AL-lambda cases (p=1.4E-07). We also detected a higher incidence of mixed AL/AH type in localized AL (18%) when compared to systemic AL (5%; Odds Ratio=4.2673, p<0.0001).

We next turned to the organ specific IGKV and IGLV gene family usage patterns in patients with localized amyloidosis. For 147 localized AL-kappa cases, KV3 was most dominant in lung (64%) and KV1 was dominant in skin (38%). For 246 localized AL-lambda cases, LV2 was most prevalent in lung (34%) and LV3 was most prevalent in skin (36%). For bladder, both LV1 and LV2 had comparable prevalence (42% and 32%).

For 361 systemic AL-kappa cases, KV1 consistently ranked at the top of gene families used in GI tract (55%), heart (71%), kidney (59%), liver (75%) and fat aspirate (50%). For 877 systemic AL-lambda cases, LV2 was predominant in GI tract (30%), LV3 in heart (35%) and LV6 in kidney (33%). The prevalence of LV1, LV2 and LV3 in liver is comparable (36%, 22% and 31%). LV6 and LV3 had comparable prevalence (22% and 24%) in AL-lambda fat aspirates.

Conclusion The novel proteomics method detects IGLC V family usage in large cohorts of AL patients. It identifies unique profiles in systemic and localized cases, and in different organ sites. This information will be helpful in determining systemic versus localized nature of AL amyloidosis at diagnosis and to assess risk of specific end organ involvement. We found also a strong association between IGKV and IGLV gene usage and organ involvement.

4fb7a4ffc0540ba502378dd6b5fb02ef51ea2b50,Identification of gene sets and pathways associated with lactation performance in mice.,"Mammary transcriptome analyses across the lactation cycle and transgenic animal studies have identified candidate genes for mammogenesis, lactogenesis and involution; however, there is a lack of information on pathways that contribute to lactation performance. Previously we have shown significant differences in lactation performance, mammary gland histology, and gene expression profiles during lactation [lactation day 9 (L9)] between CBA/CaH (CBA) and the superior performing QSi5 strains of mice. In the present study, we compared these strains at midpregnancy [pregnancy day 12 (P12)] and utilized these data along with data from a 14th generation of intercross (AIL) to develop an integrative analysis of lactation performance. Additional analysis by quantitative reverse transcription PCR examined the correlation between expression profiles of lactation candidate genes and lactation performance across six inbred strains of mice. The analysis demonstrated that the mammary epithelial content per unit area was similar between CBA and QSi5 mice at P12, while differential expression was detected in 354 mammary genes (false discovery rate < 0.1). Gene ontology and functional annotation analyses showed that functional annotation terms associated with cell division and proliferation were the most enriched in the differentially expressed genes between these two strains at P12. Further analysis revealed that genes associated with neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and calcium signaling pathways were significantly upregulated and positively correlated with lactation performance, while genes associated with cell cycle and DNA replication pathways were downregulated and positively correlated with lactation performance. There was also a significant negative correlation between Grb10 expression and lactation performance. In summary, using an integrative genomic approach we have identified key genes and pathways associated with lactation performance.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jerry W.

27822318f2c8dbf5f92a4bd31d395bcca7db45cb,Statistical and machine learning methods to analyze large-scale mass spectrometry data,"Modern biology is faced with vast amounts of data that contain valuable information yet to be extracted. Proteomics, the study of proteins, has repositories with thousands of mass spectrometry experiments. These data gold mines could further our knowledge of proteins as the main actors in cell processes and signaling. Here, we explore methods to extract more information from this data using statistical and machine learning methods. First, we present advances for studies that aggregate hundreds of runs. We introduce MaRaCluster, which clusters mass spectra for large-scale datasets using statistical methods to assess similarity of spectra. It identified up to 40% more peptides than the state-of-the-art method, MS-Cluster. Further, we accommodated large-scale data analysis in Percolator, a popular postprocessing tool for mass spectrometry data. This reduced the runtime for a draft human proteome study from a full day to 10 minutes. Second, we clarify and promote the contentious topic of protein false discovery rates (FDRs). Often, studies report lists of proteins but fail to report protein FDRs. We provide a framework to systematically discuss protein FDRs and take away hesitance. We also added protein FDRs to Percolator, opting for the best-peptide approach which proved superior in a benchmark of scalable protein inference methods. Third, we tackle the low sensitivity of protein quantification methods. Current methods lack proper control of error sources and propagation. To remedy this, we developed Triqler, which controls the protein quantification FDR through a Bayesian framework. We also introduce MaRaQuant, which proposes a quantification-first approach that applies clustering prior to identification. This reduced the number of spectra to be searched and allowed us to spot unidentified analytes of interest. Combining these tools outperformed the state-of-the-art method, MaxQuant/Perseus, and found enriched functional terms for datasets that had none before.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Matthew The"", ids = ""6808506"")",80a159bdd34b26940ebbf7a786fdc419081d0cd9,496d1a7ffd07e4d6ffe0067cac5329cf0a6b25ea;

939533c93fb6e556281dade7ddfdf9e49b9fbb2c,Multiplicity Issues in Clinical Trials-Look at it with a magnifying glass !,"With recent trends in the drug development process, modern clinical trials have gone a step ahead in evaluating safety and efficacy of new treatments with inclusion of multiple objectives in a trial and its interpretation. Multiplicity arises when a trial departs from simple design to complex design because of multiple tests, when one considers a set of statistical inferences simultaneously. Multiplicity issues arise in various situations (multiple endpoints, sub-group analysis, multiple doses or treatments, interim monitoring and with repeated measures data), in dealing with these issues, one need to control error rate by controlling FWER (Family Wise Error rate) or FDR (False Discovery Rate), eventually there will be loss of power. Often more complex and consistent procedures are required to deal with both multiplicity and power. Here we are going to review multiplicity and different procedures to deal with these issues, with strong control on Î± (alpha) with minimal loss of power.",2016,,"list(name = ""Madhusudhan Bandi"", ids = ""4960455"")",,,,,
2c52bb61c884b1aa1da32072d7cdc04835001853,HT-eQTL: Integrative eQTL Analysis in a Large Number of Human Tissues,"Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis identifies genetic markers associated with the expression of a gene. Most existing eQTL analyses and methods investigate association in a single, readily available tissue, such as blood. Joint analysis of eQTL in multiple tissues has the potential to improve, and expand the scope of, single-tissue analyses. Large-scale collaborative efforts such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) program are currently generating high quality data in a large number of tissues. Computational constraints restrict existing methods for genome-wide multi-tissue eQTL analysis to around ten tissues; a computationally scalable method for integrative eQTL analysis in larger numbers of tissues is needed. We develop an integrative method, HT-eQTL (""HT"" stands for high-tissue), for eQTL analysis in a large number of tissues. The method builds on a recently developed hierarchical Bayesian framework (Li et al., 2016). Using a simple multi-Probit model and leveraging the computational and statistical features of the hierarchical Bayesian model, HT-eQTL integrates estimates from 2-tissue models into a single high-tissue model. The fitting procedure exploits a parallel computing scheme; the computational time is a polynomial function of the number of tissues. After model fitting, we employ a local false discovery rate approach to identify eQTLs with different configurations across tissues. We compare the performance of HT-eQTL and other competitive multi-tissue methods using a simulation study. We also apply HT-eQTL to the GTEx v6p data with 20 tissues, and obtain novel insights into eQTL and tissue specificity.

5700afad589430c5425ed59c766d0a8c84b45349,Identification of novel susceptibility genes in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus using a uniquely designed candidate gene pathway platform.,"OBJECTIVE
Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents a unique subgroup of patients for genetic study. The present study was undertaken to identify susceptibility genes contributing to SLE, using a novel candidate gene pathway microarray platform to investigate gene expression in patients with childhood-onset SLE and both of their parents.


METHODS
Utilizing bioinformatic tools, a platform of 9,412 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 1,204 genes was designed and validated. Molecular inversion probes and high-throughput SNP technologies were used for assay development. Seven hundred fifty three subjects, corresponding to 251 full trios of childhood-onset SLE families, were genotyped and analyzed using transmission disequilibrium testing (TDT) and multitest corrections.


RESULTS
Family-based TDT showed a significant association of SLE with a N673S polymorphism in the P-selectin gene (SELP) (P = 5.74 x 10(-6)) and a C203S polymorphism in the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 gene (IRAK1) (P = 9.58 x 10(-6)). These 2 SNPs had a false discovery rate for multitest correction of <0.05, and therefore a >95% probability of being considered as proven. Furthermore, 7 additional SNPs showed q values of <0.5, suggesting association with SLE and providing a direction for followup studies. These additional genes notably included TNFRSF6 (Fas) and IRF5, supporting previous findings of their association with SLE pathogenesis.


CONCLUSION
SELP and IRAK1 were identified as novel SLE-associated genes with a high degree of significance, suggesting new directions in understanding the pathogenesis of SLE. The overall design and results of this study demonstrate that the candidate gene pathway microarray platform used provides a novel and powerful approach that is generally applicable in identifying genetic foundations of complex diseases.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Chaim O.

caada332dbf6773bf2df06191fd0fb88beb9fab9,Copy number variations of the IL-22 gene are associated with ankylosing spondylitis: A case-control study in Chinese Han population.,"IL-22 provides a new insight into the mechanisms of autoimmunity, and copy number variations (CNVs) are associated with autoimmune diseases. This study aims to explore the association of IL-22 gene CNVs with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) susceptibility. The copy numbers of IL-22 gene (2 fragments: IL-22_1, IL-22_2) were examined by AccuCopyâ„¢ methods in a cohort of 649 AS patients and 628 controls. Association of IL-22 CNVs and AS susceptibility was analyzed, and AS risk was estimated by Odds Ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and the Benjamini-Hochberg method was applied to regulate the false discovery rate (FDR). We found one copy of IL-22 gene was significantly associated with AS [OR=0.345, 95%CI (0.144, 0.827), P=0.013, PFDR=0.026] in the IL-22_2 fragment, and this association still exist after adjustment of age and sex [OR=0.344, 95%CI (0.143, 0.825), P=0.017, PFDR=0.034]. In the stratification analysis by gender, the statistical difference was detected in males in the IL-22_2 fragment [OR=0.306, 95%CI (0.121, 0.778), P=0.009, PFDR=0.018; adjusted OR=0.306, 95%CI (0.120, 0.777), P=0.013, PFDR=0.026].

114a60c6112b418fd21809aa0eca17b86da6649c,Voxel-based morphometry in individual patients: a pilot study in early Huntington disease.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has proved a powerful method to detect subtle changes of gray matter (GM) at the group level but the role of VBM for the detection of GM changes in single subjects, especially in those with suspected neurodegenerative disorder, remains uncertain. Here, we performed single subject analyses in 22 patients in early stages of Huntington disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder with a well-known and characteristic pattern of GM loss.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We applied an ANCOVA with age and gender as covariates and corrected for multiple statistical tests by false discovery rate (P < 0.05). Each patient was compared to 133 healthy controls. The same procedure was applied to 22 of the controls matched for age and gender in a pair-wise manner.


RESULTS
Our analyses yielded biologically plausible results in HD patients in which GM decrease within the caudate nucleus could be identified in 15 of the 16 most affected patients while GM decrease was found in only 1 control subject. Lowering the size of the control group yielded comparable results with 99 and 66 control subjects whereas sensitivity decreased with 33 control subjects.

1f6fff1d6e3ce4792521ffa64bf828b9c27ab6e1,Hippocampal atrophy in temporal lobe epilepsy: the 'generator' and 'receiver'.,"OBJECTIVE
Some patients with unilateral medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) display bilateral hippocampal atrophy on MRI, even though seizures originate in only one hippocampus. The correct identification of the epileptogenic hippocampus (the 'generator') vs the non-epileptogenic (the 'receiver') may lead to better surgical planning and results.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We studied 14 patients with MTLE (eight left and six right) who became seizure free after unilateral hippocampal resection, with hippocampal sclerosis confirmed by histology. Hippocampal tridimensional morphometry was performed comparing patients and healthy controls employing a voxel-wise Wilcoxon test. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons with the application of a False Discovery Rate (FDR)-corrected threshold for q < 0.05.


RESULTS
Patients with MTLE showed atrophy involving the ipsilateral hippocampus and the contralateral hippocampus, more pronouncedly within the ipsilateral hippocampus in the anterior-inferior aspect of the hippocampal head (left MTLE, left hippocampus x = -28, y = -16, z = -24, Z = 3.6; right MTLE, right hippocampus x = 22, y = -11, z = -27, Z = 2.9). On the contralateral hippocampus, the atrophy was more noticeable in the posterior head and body areas.


CONCLUSION
The epileptogenic hippocampal atrophy has an anatomically distinct pattern compared with the contralateral hippocampus. This information may help guide the presurgical assessment of MTLE.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Leonardo Bonilha"", ids = ""3330620""); list(name = ""Jonathan J.

2902ca35cef98e8f239f7a8fdcd930ab180b2a3a,Abstract 3883: Gene expression predicts ex vivo drug sensitivity in acute myeloid leukemia,"Introduction: Ex vivo drug sensitivity studies of samples derived from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients have been shown to be predictive of in vivo response. These findings are based on a limited number of well-characterized agents for which in vivo patient response data and ex vivo drug sensitivity dataâ€”on that same patientâ€”are available. To show the feasibility of scaling such ex vivo studies to large drug screens, we characterized the reproducibility of expression-based models of drug response across two independent data setsâ€”one generated at the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) and the second at the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM). Methods: We harmonized two large-scale AML ex vivo studies screened for drug response and profiled transcriptomicallyâ€”OHSU (303 AML patient samples and 160 drugs) and FIMM (48 AML samples and 480 drugs). The two panels have 94 drugs in common. Log-logistic curves were fit to the dose-response data and area under the dose-response curves (AUCs) were calculated. Predictive modeling using Ridge regression or an integrative Bayesian approach was performed for each drug AUC independently using 202 highly-variable and/or cancer-associated genes as features. Results: For each of the 94 drugs in common between the two data sets, we trained a Ridge regression model on the OHSU data set, used the model to predict response in the FIMM data set, and calculated the Pearson correlation between the predicted and observed FIMM responses. 41 of the 94 drug models had a positive and statistically significant correlation [false discovery rate (FDR) -4 ) Conclusions: Our results using independent data sets and two statistical approaches suggest that certain drugs (including MEK and EGFR/VEGFR inhibitors) are amenable to expression-based predictive modeling in AML. Future work will focus on inferring individual biomarkers of response. Citation Format: Brian S. White, Suleiman A. Khan, Muhammad Ammad-ud-din, Swapnil Potdar, Mike J. Mason, Cristina E.

502698fa144a5100facea10237369f13b0f355db,Microarray of Bone Marrow CD34+/Lin- Cells from Patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML),"This study aimed to determine the gene expression profiling (GEP) of bone marrow (BM) CD34+/lin- cells of CML patients at diagnosis and after nilotinib treatment.Microarray was performed on 30 CML patients at diagnosis as well as 8 patients after 12 months of nilotinib treatment using the latest generation Affymetrix GeneChip HTA 2.0 to further investigate genomic complexity. Bone marrow blood (in a range of 5-20 ml) samples were collected from patients at diagnosis and after 3, 6 and 12 months of nilotinib treatment. BM mononuclear cells were purified by density gradient centrifugation at 800 rpm for 20 min and soon after CD34+/lin- cells were isolated using Diamond CD34 Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). The purity of CD34+/lin-cells was about 97% as determined by flow citometry and the cells were counted at diagnosis and after the treatment with nilotinib (at 3, 6, and 12 months). BM CD34+/lin- cells of 30 patients at diagnosis and after 3 and 6 months of nilotinib were resuspended in RNAlater (Ambion, Life Technologies) and stored at -20Â°C until RNA extraction was performed. Total RNA was extracted from BM CD34+/lin- cells using MagMAX 96 Total RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion). BM CD34+/lin- cells were counted and a range of 100,000-800,000 has been noted at diagnosis. cRNA was prepared according to OvationPico WTA System V2 kit followed by Encore Biotin Module Kit (NuGEN). Ultimately, cRNA was hybridized to HTA 2.0 and signals were scanned by Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. We observed that the number of CD34+/lin- cells dramatically decreased at 3 months (1,000-600,000), after 6 months (1,000-260,000) and after 12 months (100-130,000). In particular, CD34+/lin- cells were even less than 1000 after 12 months of nilotinib. If the number of CD34+/lin- cells after 12 months of nilotinib was less than 1000, we directly resuspended the cells in Prelude direct Lysis module (NuGEN) and microarray experiments were performed without RNA extraction. In this case, cRNA was prepared using Ovation One Direct System kit followed by Encore Biotin Module Kit (Nugen) and finally hybridized to the HTA 2.0. Microarray experiments were performed on CD34+/lin- cells of 30 CML patients at diagnosis with HTA 2.0. Moreover, we performed microarray experiments on CD34+/lin- cells of 8 CML patients at diagnosis vs. 8 CML patients after 12 months of nilotinib using HTA 2.0. Data was preprocessed and normalized using Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) algorithm. The Significant Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) was used to identify genes with statistically significant changes in expression in CML patients at diagnosis and at 12 months of treatment. P-values were corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate. In conclusion, as far as we know, this is the first study which has isolated BM CD34+/lin-cells from CML patients at diagnosis and after nilotinib treatment. We observed a wide variety of the number of CD34+/lin- cells in 30 CML patients at diagnosis as well as after 3, 6 and 12 months of nilotinib. In particular, CD34+/lin- cells of CML patients at diagnosis were over 100.000. RNA was extracted and cRNA was prepared with OvationPico WTA System V2 kit followed by Encore Biotin Module Kit (NuGEN) and finally hybridized to HTA 2.0. On the other hand, the number of CD34+/lin- cells of CML patients after 12 months of nilotinib markedly decreased as low as 100 cells. In this case, we decided to avoid RNA extraction from the cells and we directly prepared cRNA using Ovation One Direct System kit and Encore Biotin Module Kit (Nugen) followed by the hybridization to the HTA 2.0 Array. To increase the statistical power in biomarker identification, we combined samples pre-processed with different experimental protocols (NuGEN) using ComBat, an empirical Bayes framework that adjusts data for batch effects and is robust to outliers in small datasets. Principal component analysis applied to the expression data before and after ComBat adjustment shows that the adopted normalization procedure effectively removes the systematic bias introduced by different protocols.

The chronic stress of unfavorable neighborhood conditions may lead to dysregulation of the stress reactivity and inflammatory pathways, potentially mediated through epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. We used multi-level models to examine the relationship between 2 neighborhood conditions and methylation levels of 18 genes related to stress reactivity and inflammation in purified monocytes from 1,226 participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a population-based sample of US adults. Neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage, a summary of 16 census-based metrics, was associated with DNA methylation [False discovery rate (FDR) q-value â‰¤ 0.1] in 2 out of 7 stress-related genes evaluated (CRF, SLC6A4) and 2 out of 11 inflammation-related genes (F8, TLR1). Neighborhood social environment, a summary measure of aesthetic quality, safety, and social cohesion, was associated with methylation in 4 of the 7 stress-related genes (AVP, BDNF, FKBP5, SLC6A4) and 7 of the 11 inflammation-related genes (CCL1, CD1D, F8, KLRG1, NLRP12, SLAMF7, TLR1). High socioeconomic disadvantage and worse social environment were primarily associated with increased methylation. In 5 genes with significant associations between neighborhood and methylation (FKBP5, CD1D, F8, KLRG1, NLRP12), methylation was associated with gene expression of at least one transcript. These results demonstrate that multiple dimensions of neighborhood context may influence methylation levels and subsequent gene expression of stress- and inflammation-related genes, even after accounting for individual socioeconomic factors. Further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these relationships will be important for understanding the etiology of health disparities.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jennifer A.

c43ed8b1a02f55f80c6253d0c6b566188201c157,Peptide identifications and false discovery rates using different mass spectrometry platforms.,"Characterization of endogenous neuropeptides produced from post-translational proteolytic processing of precursor proteins is a demanding task. A variety of complex prohormone processing steps generate molecular diversity from neuropeptide prohormones, making in silico neuropeptide discovery difficult. In addition, the wide range of endogenous peptide concentrations as well as significant peptide complexity further challenge the structural characterization of neuropeptides. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS), performed in conjunction with bioinformatics, allows for high-throughput characterization of peptides. Mass analyzers and molecular dissociation techniques render specific characteristics to the acquired data and thus, influence the analysis of the MS data using bioinformatic algorithms for follow-up peptide identification. Here we evaluated the efficacy of several distinct peptidomic workflows using two mass spectrometers, the Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid and Bruker Impact HD UHR-QqTOF, for confident peptide discovery and characterization. We compared the results in several categories, including the numbers of identified peptides, full-length mature neuropeptides among all identifications, and precursor proteins mapped by the identified peptides. We also characterized the peptide false discovery rate (FDR) based on the occurrence of amidation, a known post-translational modification (PTM) that has been shown to require the presence of a C-terminal glycine. Thus, amidation events without a preceding glycine were considered false-positive amidation assignments. We compared the FDR calculated by the search engine used here to the minimum FDR estimated via false amidation assignments. The search engine severely underestimated the rate of false PTM assignments among the identified peptides, regardless of the specific MS platform used.",2018,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Krishna D B Anapindi"", ids = ""29421004""); list(name = ""Elena V Romanova"", ids = ""145381888""); list(name = ""Bruce R.

It shows also that the direct extension of the classical approach based on permutation tests for estimating false discovery rates of univariate variable scoring procedures does not extend very well to the case of multivariate tree-based importance measures.,2008,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""VÃ¢n Anh Huynh-Thu"", ids = ""1403676310""); list(name = ""Louis Wehenkel"", ids = ""1695713""); list(name = ""Pierre Geurts"", ids = ""50206577"")",a5b7118c78a7663d09fc25ecce90e5c3aa847d9d; f4c04a0587d9e4a704a81c929a0b0440865d7fa0; d6ad6a018b0774bbf80b84ccee229f55309e7e6a; b117477c9880728b9484bdbf078f85fd1db38404; ea6ac421ea2850ef1524ef27e75a880133cfe10d; 80d51a331e28136a6bcbeb9729b03c7a10be5161; 607fb677be1c9799c3783750eb5f19d8d9bf9ffe; 90bf6b37ab7305d1a0040155bbef95064edbf682; 68d2be33599b1326df5615c34ba0cf04629255f3; 37cd3c1fb99a386e3fa412f9381fb1a961c13c5a; a91100cf82fee15f57f6ad030b48295eb054b667; 8e58e0a89eadcff19b95bfdc9e6318832a93bfc6; 2178ed5345da1ac6b256562b2820033e1441e8bc; 4d2758c7bc95e5f296a68a9ac6908771d6a81168; 855a34a12df6045d18e2d6a9ba10ae1075a14d8b,256f29267c2317228f6a7b65d698326f0a285e36; fb6b4b57f431a0cfbb83bb2af8beab4ee694e94c; bf48afa4422fc02c0d07bbbf262cb8254a365359; 13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986; 34d405eaecab40a932108a7ff97e92fb8fd1ae4e; d7203a27edddacbc573a29754bc192f7bedecaca; c69ff9036ee9423b7b0c36f0a0822e28296dfd74; 162733f1f7f2af787c87e635144dcae3f38e2c14; 102ed1e9b785caec1cb69c043dbda7b2cfa2d57d; 4f2b48d49c81233aba44396af5b9848f04ed283d; 0e7fd9422eaa403b80d708588d48b7d98abe5d63; 8a98daedab03b5b18a77f47a538499531009c9ed; 8017699564136f93af21575810d557dba1ee6fc6; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44,,,60-73
57b83855490e5648ae7a2f045500bca6405ba176,A generic approach for the development of short-term predictions of Escherichia coli and biotoxins in shellfish,"Microbiological contamination or elevated marine biotoxin concentrations within shellfish can result in temporary closure of shellfish aquaculture harvesting, leading to financial loss for the aquaculture business and a potential reduction in consumer confidence in shellfish products. We present a method for predicting short-term variations in shellfish concentrations of Escherichia coli and biotoxin (okadaic acid and its derivates dinophysistoxins and pectenotoxins). The approach was evaluated for 2 contrasting shellfish harvesting areas. Through a meta-data analysis and using environmental data (in situ, satellite observations and meteorological nowcasts and forecasts), key environmental drivers were identified and used to develop models to predict E. coli and biotoxin concentrations within shellfish. Models were trained and evaluated using independent datasets, and the best models were identified based on the model exhibiting the lowest root mean square error. The best biotoxin model was able to provide 1 wk forecasts with an accuracy of 86%, a 0% false positive rate and a 0% false discovery rate (n = 78 observations) when used to predict the closure of shellfish beds due to biotoxin. The best E. coli models were used to predict the European hygiene classification of the shellfish beds to an accuracy of 99% (n = 107 observations) and 98% (n = 63 observations) for a bay (St Austell Bay) and an estuary (Turnaware Bar), respectively. This generic approach enables high accuracy short-term farm-specific forecasts, based on readily accessible environmental data and observations.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wiebke Schmidt"", ids = ""144542363""); list(name = ""Hayley L.

8156ebc5c1b147f9b77040c1d9d2595d7f18fe20,Incorporating feature reliability in false discovery rateestimation improves statistical power to detect differentially expressed features,"Feature selection is a critical step in translational omics research. False discovery rate (FDR) is anintegral tool of statistical inference in feature selection from high-throughput data. It is commonly used to screen features (SNPs, genes, proteins, or metabolites) for their relevance to the specific clinical outcome under study. Traditionally, all features are treated equally in the calculation of false discovery rate. In many applications, different features are measured with different levels of reliability. In such situations, treating all features equally will cause substantial loss of statistical power to detect significant features. Feature reliability can often be quantified in the measurements. Here we present a new method to estimate the local false discovery rate that incorporates feature reliability. We also propose a composite reliability index for metabolomics data. Combined with the new local false discovery rate method, it helps to detect more differentially expressed metabolites that are biologically meaningful in a real metabolomics dataset.",2014,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Elizabeth Y Chong"", ids = ""38201490""); list(name = ""Yijian Huang"", ids = ""39830054""); list(name = ""Hao Wu"", ids = ""46477167""); list(name = ""Tianwei Yu"", ids = ""48881100""); list(name = ""Nima Ghasemzadeh"", ids = ""5055250""); list(name = ""Karan Uppal"", ids = ""2944354""); list(name = ""Arshed A Quyyumi"", ids = ""3271168""); list(name = ""Dean P.

The organization of these alterations into brain structural networks remains largely unexplored. We investigated 508 participants (281 males) with ADHD (N = 210), their unaffected siblings (N = 108), individuals with subthreshold ADHD (N = 49), and unrelated healthy controls (N = 141) with an age range from 7 â€“ 18 years old from 336 families in the Dutch NeuroIMAGE project. Source based morphometry was used to examine structural brain network alterations and their association with symptoms and cognitive performance. Two networks showed significant reductions in individuals with ADHD compared to unrelated healthy controls after False Discovery Rate correction. Component A, mainly located in bilateral Crus I, showed a case/control difference with sub-clinical cases being intermediate between cases and controls. The unaffected siblings were similar to controls. After correcting for IQ and medication status, component A showed a negative correlation with inattention symptoms across the entire sample. Component B included a maximum cluster in the bilateral insula, where unaffected siblings, similar to cases, showed significantly reduced loadings compared to controls; but no relationship with individual symptoms or cognitive measures was found for component B. This multivariate approach suggests that areas reflecting genetic liability within ADHD are partly separate from those areas modulating symptom severity.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Wen-hao Jiang"", ids = ""19221944""); list(name = ""Kuaikuai Duan"", ids = ""47075557""); list(name = ""Kelly Rootes-Murdy"", ids = ""1491881314""); list(name = ""Pieter J.

d9f9c9807fd8ba58ae5bc44c867f99b0a6235bf1,Synchronous Breast Cancer: Phenotypic Similarities on MRI.,"BACKGROUND
Previous studies have shown discrepancies between index and synchronous breast cancer in histology and molecular phenotype. It is yet unknown whether this observation also applies to the MRI phenotype.


PURPOSE
To investigate whether the appearance of breast cancer on MRI (i.e. phenotype) is different from that of additional breast cancer (i.e. synchronous cancer), and whether such a difference, if it exists, is associated with prognosis.


STUDY TYPE
Retrospective.


POPULATION
In all, 464 consecutive patients with early-stage ER+/HER2- breast cancer were included; 34/464 (7.3%) had 44 synchronous cancers in total (34 ipsilateral, 10 contralateral).


SEQUENCE
1.5T, contrast-enhanced T1 -weighted.


ASSESSMENT
We assessed imaging phenotype using 50 quantitative features from each cancer and applied principal component analysis (PCA) to identify independent properties. The degree of phenotype difference was assessed. An association between phenotype differences and prognosis in terms of the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) and PREDICT score were analyzed.


STATISTICAL TESTS
PCA; Wilcoxon rank sum test; Benjamini-Hochberg to control the false discovery rate.


RESULTS
PCA identified eight components in patients with ipsilateral synchronous cancer. Six out of eight were significantly different between index and synchronous cancer. These components represented features describing texture (three components, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.004), size (P < 0.001), smoothness (P < 0.001), and kinetics (P = 0.004). Phenotype differences in terms of the six components were split in tertiles. Larger phenotype differences in size, kinetics, and texture were associated with significantly worse prognosis in terms of NPI (P = 0.019, P = 0.045, P = 0.014), but not for the PREDICT score (P = 0.109, P = 0.479, P = 0.109). PCA identified six components in patients with contralateral synchronous cancer. None were significantly different from the index cancer (P = 0.178, P = 0.178, P = 0.178, P = 0.326, P = 0.739, P = 0.423).


DATA CONCLUSION
The MRI phenotype of ER+/HER2- breast cancer was different from that of ipsilateral synchronous cancer and a large phenotype difference was associated with worse prognosis. No significant difference was found for synchronous contralateral cancer.

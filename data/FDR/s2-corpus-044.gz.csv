a327c0828d60acbc2ecb0aea517206052c341194,Propensity score-adjusted three-component mixture model for drug-drug interaction data mining in FDA Adverse Event Reporting System.,"With increasing trend of polypharmacy, drug-drug interaction (DDI)-induced adverse drug events (ADEs) are considered as a major challenge for clinical practice. As premarketing clinical trials usually have stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria, limited comedication data capture and often times small sample size have limited values in study DDIs. On the other hand, ADE reports collected by spontaneous reporting system (SRS) become an important source for DDI studies. There are two major challenges in detecting DDI signals from SRS: confounding bias and false positive rate. In this article, we propose a novel approach, propensity score-adjusted three-component mixture model (PS-3CMM). This model can simultaneously adjust for confounding bias and estimate false discovery rate for all drug-drug-ADE combinations in FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), which is a preeminent SRS database. In simulation studies, PS-3CMM performs better in detecting true DDIs comparing to the existing approach. It is more sensitive in selecting the DDI signals that have nonpositive individual drug relative ADE risk (NPIRR). The application of PS-3CMM is illustrated in analyzing the FAERS database. Compared to the existing approaches, PS-3CMM prioritizes DDI signals differently. PS-3CMM gives high priorities to DDI signals that have NPIRR. Both simulation studies and FAERS data analysis conclude that our new PS-3CMM is a new method that is complement to the existing DDI signal detection methods.",2019,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xueying Wang"", ids = ""48631816""); list(name = ""Lang Li"", ids = ""153131705""); list(name = ""Lei Wang"", ids = ""145131942""); list(name = ""Weixing Feng"", ids = ""7988948""); list(name = ""Pengyue Zhang"", ids = ""48754197"")",,,Statistics in medicine,,

The subset of individuals completed an 11C Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) scan. Cognitive function and falls risk were assessed at baseline, 6-months, and 12-months. Global cognition, executive functions, and information processing speed were measured using: 1) ADAS-Cog; 2) Trail Making Test; 3) Digit Span Test; 4) Stroop Test, and 5) Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Falls risk was measured using the Physiological Profile Assessment. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses determined the unique contribution of AÎ² on changes in cognitive function and falls risk at 12-months after controlling for experimental group (i.e. aerobic exercise training or usual care control) and baseline performance. To correct for multiple comparisons, we applied the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to obtain a false discovery rate corrected threshold using alphaÂ =Â 0.05.ResultsHigher PIB retention was significantly associated with greater decrements in set shifting (Trail Making Test, adjusted R2Â =Â 35.3%, pÂ =Â 0.002), attention and conflict resolution (Stroop Test, adjusted R2Â =Â 33.4%, pÂ =Â 0.01), and information processing speed (Digit Symbol Substitution Test, adjusted R2Â =Â 24.4%, pÂ =Â 0.001) over a 12-month period. Additionally, higher PIB retention was significantly associated with increased falls risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, adjusted R2Â =Â 49.1%, pÂ =Â 0.04). PIB retention was not significantly associated with change in ADAS-Cog and Verbal Digit Span Test (pÂ >Â 0.05).ConclusionsSymptoms associated with SIVCI may be amplified by secondary AÎ² pathology.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01027858, December 7, 2009.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Elizabeth Dao"", ids = ""3208092""); list(name = ""John R Best"", ids = ""4865485""); list(name = ""Ging-Yuek Robin Hsiung"", ids = ""123540198""); list(name = ""Vesna Sossi"", ids = ""2872450""); list(name = ""Claudia Jacova"", ids = ""2336673""); list(name = ""Roger C.

bad28601d800d81d965acb56aa262af41575cac1,Gene Expression Profiling in Blood Provides Reproducible Molecular Insights into Asthma Control,"Rationale: Maintaining optimal symptom control remains the primary objective of asthma treatment. Better understanding of the biologic underpinnings of asthma control may lead to the development of improved clinical and pharmaceutical approaches. Objectives: To identify molecular pathways and interrelated genes whose differential expression was associated with asthma control. Methods: We performed gene set enrichment analyses of asthma control in 1,170 adults with asthma, each with gene expression data derived from either whole blood (WB) or unstimulated CD4+ T lymphocytes (CD4), and a selfâ€reported asthma control score representing either the preceding 6 months (chronic) or 7 days (acute). Our study comprised a discovery WB cohort (n = 245, chronic) and three independent, nonoverlapping replication cohorts: a second WB set (n = 448, acute) and two CD4 sets (n = 300, chronic; n = 77, acute). Measurements and Main Results: In the WB discovery cohort, we found significant overrepresentation of genes associated with asthma control in 1,106 gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (false discovery rate, <5%). Of these, 583 (53%) replicated in at least one replication cohort (false discovery rate, <25%). Suboptimal control was associated with signatures of eosinophilic and granulocytic inflammatory signals, whereas optimal control signatures were enriched for immature lymphocytic patterns. These signatures included two related biologic processes related to activation by TREMâ€1 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1) and lipopolysaccharide. Conclusions: Together, these results demonstrate the existence of specific, reproducible transcriptomic components in blood that vary with degree of asthma control and implicate a novel biologic target (TREMâ€1).",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Damien C.

52fc0aae8a841fb2c55fae4114eb993a1e1c6c47,Wnt signaling pathway correlates with ossification of the spinal ligament: A microRNA array and immunohistochemical study.,"BACKGROUND
Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament or the ligamentum flavum parallels endochondral ossification. Cell differentiation at the ossification front is known to be important during this process, although the factors regulating its initiation and progression are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify factors important for the regulation of chondrocyte/osteoblast differentiation during spinal ossification.


METHODS
Ligamentum flavum tissue was isolated from 25 patients who underwent decompressive surgery for cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Tissue sections were used for inÂ vitro culture to obtain primary cells through migration methods. To identify microRNAs associated with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, cultured cells were prepared from the ligamentous tissue (nÂ =Â 4; continuous type) or from control ligamentous samples harvested from patients with cervical spondylosis without spinal ossification, and analyzed using a microRNA array. The ligamentous sections were also examined by immunohistochemistry for the expression of candidate microRNA target genes.


RESULTS
The microRNA array identified 177 factors; 12 of which were expressed at significantly different levels in patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament compared to those in control patients. The hsa-miR-487b-3p was down-regulated in patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, which met the false discovery rate of <0.05. This microRNA was predicted to regulate the expression of genes involved in Wnt signaling. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry of Wnt signaling proteins, including Wnt 3a, LRP5/6, and beta-catenin, revealed positive expression in mesenchymal cells and/or premature chondrocytes at the ossification front.


CONCLUSION
Our results suggested that down-regulation of miR-487b-3p plays an important role in the initiation of Wnt signaling during the ossification process. Wnt signaling may regulate both chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation and the specification of endochondral ossification in the pathogenesis of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament or the ligamentum flavum.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Takafumi Yayama"", ids = ""49692135""); list(name = ""Kanji Mori"", ids = ""40485455""); list(name = ""Noriaki Okumura"", ids = ""6125459""); list(name = ""Kazuya Nishizawa"", ids = ""1939927""); list(name = ""Kosuke Kumagai"", ids = ""50540423""); list(name = ""Akira Nakamura"", ids = ""49513232""); list(name = ""Shinji Imai"", ids = ""32668693"")",b1e4991a0ee3105bec1878868fed958759e80b29; fa1fe1c04698eb2aaea07819f141d95ca63cca55; 1f8a5dc519b7ad2b348676ce81150b0ab03ac3f7; 8c016a351eef305da544dde18281413c939793e5,,Journal of orthopaedic science : official journal of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association,23 1,"

Methods and Results: We determined incident CAD risk for 760 members of 66 hyperlipidemic families (â‰¥ 2 first degree relatives with the same hyperlipidemia) and 19,644 Finnish FINRISK population study participants. We also quantified 151 lipid species in plasma or serum samples from 550 members of 73 hyperlipidemic pedigrees and 897 FINRISK participants using a mass spectrometric shotgun lipidomics platform. Hyperlipidemias (LDL-C or triacylglycerides over 90th population percentile) were associated with increased CAD risk (high LDL-C: HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.48â€“2.04; high triacylglycerides: HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09â€“1.74) and the risk estimates were very similar between the family and population samples. High LDL-C was associated with altered levels of 105 lipid species in families (p-value range 0.033â€“7.3*10âˆ’20 at 5% false discovery rate) and 51 species in the population samples (p-value range 0.017â€“6.8*10âˆ’21). Hypertriglyceridemia was associated with altered levels of 117 lipid species in families (p-value range 0.035â€“1.8*10âˆ’49) and 119 species in the population sample (p-value range 0.038â€“2.3*10âˆ’56). The lipidomics profiles of hyperlipidemias were highly similar in families and population samples. Conclusion: We identified distinct lipidomic profiles associated with high LDL-C and triacylglyceride levels. CAD risk, lipidomic profiles and genetic profiles are highly similar between familial and population-ascertained hyperlipidemias, providing evidence of similar and overlapping underlying mechanisms.

Using the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene as an example, we identified 210 highly reliable SNPs by next-generation sequencing analysis program MAQ and Samtools, of which 69 were novel ones, in the 123-kb APC genomic region in 27 pair of colorectal cancers and normal adjacent tissues. We confirmed all of the eight randomly selected high-quality SNPs by allele-specific PCR, suggesting that our false discovery rate is negligible. We identified 11 SNPs in the exonic region, including one novel SNP that was not previously reported. Although 10 of them are synonymous, they were predicted to affect splicing by creating or removing exonic splicing enhancers or exonic splicing silencers. We also identified seven SNPs in the upstream region of the APC gene, three of which were only identified in the cancer tissues. Six of these upstream SNPs were predicted to affect transcription factor binding. We also observed that long-range PCR was better in capturing GC-rich regions than the NimbleGen sequence capture technique.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yin Cheng"", ids = ""2909138""); list(name = ""Jun Wang"", ids = ""40579687""); list(name = ""Jiaofang Shao"", ids = ""3178493""); list(name = ""Qiyun Chen"", ids = ""12305559""); list(name = ""Fan Mo"", ids = ""46502436""); list(name = ""Liang Suo Ma"", ids = ""145416357""); list(name = ""Xu Han"", ids = ""145760440""); list(name = ""Jing Zhang"", ids = ""2266189""); list(name = ""Chen Chen"", ids = ""49751582""); list(name = ""Cixiong Zhang"", ids = ""4730048""); list(name = ""Shuyong Lin"", ids = ""153318150""); list(name = ""Jiekai Yu"", ids = ""46380952""); list(name = ""Shu Zheng"", ids = ""2154150""); list(name = ""Sheng-cai Lin"", ids = ""35021264""); list(name = ""Biaoyang Lin"", ids = ""38800070"")",7696568afa41ffee588593890c73c90b22f9ca35; 0c91d9d9dce6ff6100b465542570df30578016e0; 06ab8ed106228655ad87a83af8545aff6c3afebc; 3347b92759cac6e608a872bb47885f61239aa3c6; aba5a8a24161f352b081391653c2e44bae9b5b13; 1562ccaef13300ae5eaa5f929d6868f5540b3816,,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,14 3,"

33d6a873af81b6779df47a6eb0d762f7fad4436a,Common Variants in PLXNA4 and Correlation to CSF-related Phenotypes in Alzheimer's Disease,"The Plexin-A 4 (PLXNA4) gene, has recently been identified in genome wide association studies (GWAS), as a novel genetic player associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, PLXNA4 genetic variations were also found to increase AD risk by tau pathology in vitro. However, the potential roles of PLXNA4 variants in the amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) pathology, were not evaluated. Five targeted loci capturing the top common variations in PLXNA4, were extracted using tagger methods. Multiple linear regression models were used to explore whether these variations can affect the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (AÎ²1-42, T-tau, and P-tau) phenotypes in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We detected that two loci (rs6467431, rs67468325) were significantly associated with CSF AÎ²1-42 levels in the hybrid population (rs6467431: P = 0.01376, rs67468325: P = 0.006536) and the significance remained after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (rs6467431: Pc = 0.03441, rs67468325: Pc = 0.03268). In the subgroup analysis, we further confirmed the association of rs6467431 in the cognitively normal (CN) subgroup (P = 0.01904, Pc = 0.04761). Furthermore, rs6467431-A carriers and rs67468325-G carriers showed higher CSF AÎ²1-42 levels than non-carriers. Nevertheless, we did not detect any significant relationships between the levels of T-tau, P-tau and these PLXNA4 loci.

Methods Samples were obtained from the Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis (CLIMB, Boston, MA), EPIC (San Francisco, CA), AMIR (Beirut, Lebanon) as part of the SUMMIT consortium, and Stockholm Prospective Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis (Stockholm, Sweden) cohorts. Serum miRNA expression was measured using locked nucleic acidâ€“based quantitative PCR. Four groups were compared: (1) MS vs healthy control (HC), (2) relapsing-remitting (RR) vs HC, (3) secondary progressive (SP) vs HC, and (4) RR vs SP. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for the comparisons. The association between each miRNA and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. For each comparison, the p values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the approach of Benjamini and Hochberg to control the false discovery rate. Results In the CLIMB cohort, 5 miRNAs (hsa-miR-484, hsa-miR-140-5p, hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-486-5p, and hsa-miR-320c) showed a significant difference between patients with MS and healthy individuals; among these, miR-484 remained significant after accounting for multiple comparisons (p = 0.01). When comparing RRMS with HCs, hsa-miR-484 showed a significant difference (p = 0.004) between the groups after accounting for multiple group comparisons. When SP and HC were compared, 6 miRNAs (hsa-miR-484, hsa-miR-140-5p, hsa-miR-142-5p, hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-320b, and hsa-miR-320c) remained significantly different after accounting for multiple comparisons. Disability correlation analysis with miRNA provided 4 miRNAs (hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-337-3p, hsa-miR-199a-5p, and hsa-miR-142-5p) that correlated with the EDSS during the internal reproducibility phase. Among these, hsa-miR-337-3p was the most statistically significant miRNA that negatively correlated with the EDSS in three of the MS cohorts tested. Conclusions These findings further confirm the use of circulating serum miRNAs as biomarkers to diagnose and monitor disease status in MS.

8ab979b9fcb6b4ea1f0e8f5658d20fb59221bfda,Detection of High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) in the 80â€“500 Hz range in epilepsy recordings using decision tree analysis,"Discrete High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) in the range of 80-500 Hz have recently received attention as a promising reliable biomarkers for epileptic activity, both in scalp EEG as well as in intracranial recordings. HFOs are often characterized by variable durations (10-100 ms) and rates of occurrence (17.5 Â± 9.5 / min). The total duration of HFOs is extremely small compared to the entire length of the EEG signals to be analyzed which, in the case of intracerebral recordings, are generally acquired over several days and sometimes up to weeks. As a result, visual marking of HFOs events associated with large amounts of EEG data is extremely tedious, inevitably subjective and requires a great deal of mental concentration. Therefore, automatic detection of HFOs can be very useful to propel the clinical use of HFOs as biomarkers of epileptogenic tissue and is crucial when conducting large-scale investigations of HFO activity. As a first step towards robust and reliable automatic detection, we propose in this paper a new method for HFOs detection based on Decision Tree analysis. The performance and added value of the proposed method are evaluated by comparing it with five other previously proposed methods. The HFO detection performances were tested in terms of sensitivity, False Discovery Rate (FDR) and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Our results demonstrate that the decision-tree approach yields low false detection (FDR=8.62 %) but that, in its current implementation, it is not highly sensitive to HFO events (sensitivity=66.96 %).

9404fe81f0373218a78ab58c3ad0e750399d0d40,GSTP1 polymorphisms sex-specific association with verbal intelligence in survivors of pediatric medulloblastoma tumors.,"Glutathione S-transferase (GST) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with a lower intellectual quotient (IQ) in medulloblastoma survivors. We investigated the association of GSTP1 polymorphisms with intellectual, neurocognitive skills (e.g., attention span, working memory, and processing speed), and adaptive outcomes for long-term pediatric medulloblastoma survivors. We hypothesized that genetic risk and sex-specific risk would contribute to significantly lower performances across all measures. Eighteen long-term pediatric medulloblastoma survivors completed the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence, California Verbal Learning Test-II, Auditory Consonant Trigrams, and Oral Symbol Digit Modality Test. Informants were interviewed with the Scales of Independent Behavior-Revised (SIB-R). After controlling for the false discovery rate, females with a polymorphism performed significantly worse than females without a polymorphism on verbal IQ (pÂ =Â .005) and SIB-R (pÂ =Â .012). There was a significant interaction between sex and polymorphism status for verbal IQ (bÂ =Â -1.8, SEÂ =Â 0.827, CI: -3.58, -.036). The main effect of this interaction was significant for females (pÂ =Â .004) and not for males (pÂ =Â .557). We found large effect sizes between males with the polymorphism and females with the polymorphism across measures of attention span (gÂ =Â .877), working memory (gÂ =Â 1.12), and processing speed (gÂ =Â 1.53). Female medulloblastoma survivors with a GSTP1 polymorphism may have increased vulnerability to deficits in core cognitive skills, IQ, and everyday functional outcomes.

059fb69e6908899f9c1f47319f3e8ffede715e35,Bayesian areal wombling using false discovery rates,"Spatial data arising in public health services are often reported as case counts or rates aggregated over areal regions (e.g. counties, census-tracts or ZIP codes), rather than being referenced with respect to the geographical coordinates of individual residences. For such areal data, subsequent inferential interest often resides in the formal identification of â€œbarriersâ€, or â€œdifference boundariesâ€, on the map, where â€œboundaryâ€ refers to a border with sharp changes in outcome on either side. This boundary detection problem is often referred to as â€œwomblingâ€ or, more specifically, â€œareal womblingâ€ for aggregated areal data, after a foundational article by Womble (1951). Existing statistical frameworks for areal wombling usually follow a two stage procedure: (i) estimate the spatial effects from an appropriate spatial model, and (ii) detect boundaries from those estimates using appropriate discrepancy metrics on those estimates. Lu and Carlin (2005), and several subsequent articles, explored areal wombling within this framework. This article treats wombling as a hypothesis-testing problem, where we are testing a substantial number of hypotheses â€“ one for each geographical boundary â€“ and seek to provide policy-makers and analysts with a final set of difference boundaries. Here we must reckon with a lurking multiplicity problem arising from the large number of individual hypothesis we are testing. We proffer a computationally feasible framework to estimate hierarchical spatial models that account for dependence between adjacent regions and test for equality of spatial effects, while adjusting for multiplicities using false discovery rates (FDR); see, e.g., Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). A simulation study is conducted to first illustrate and assess the new approach, which is then applied to detect boundaries on a county map of Minnesota that records pneumonia and influenza hospitalization rates from the SEER-Medicare program.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Pei Ying Li"", ids = ""37700256""); list(name = ""Sudipto Banerjee"", ids = ""2575622""); list(name = ""Alexander M.

dbe7e8394268fe6d0447ec3f67992112d05da4a6,Genome-wide distribution of histone H4 Lysine 16 acetylation sites and their relationship to gene expression,"BackgroundHistone post-translational modifications are critical determinants of chromatin structure and function, impacting multiple biological processes including DNA transcription, replication, and repair. The post-translational acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac) was initially identified in association with dosage compensation of the Drosophila male X chromosome. However, in mammalian cells, H4K16ac is not associated with dosage compensation and the genomic distribution of H4K16ac is not precisely known. Therefore, we have mapped the genome-wide H4K16ac distribution in human cells.ResultsWe performed H4K16ac chromatin immunoprecipitation from human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells followed by hybridization to whole-genome tiling arrays and identified 25,893 DNA regions (false discovery rate <0.005) with average length of 692 nucleotides. Interestingly, although a majority of H4K16ac sites localized within genes, only a relatively small fraction (~10%) was found near promoters, in contrast to the distribution of the acetyltransferase, MOF, responsible for acetylation at K16 of H4. Using differential gene expression profiling data, 73 genes (> Â±1.5-fold) were identified as potential H4K16ac-regulated genes. Seventeen transcription factor-binding sites were significantly associated with H4K16ac occupancy (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0005). In addition, a consensus 12-nucleotide guanine-rich sequence motif was identified in more than 55% of the H4K16ac peaks.ConclusionsThe results suggest that H4K16 acetylation has a limited effect on transcription regulation in HEK293 cells, whereas H4K16ac has been demonstrated to have critical roles in regulating transcription in mouse embryonic stem cells. Thus, H4K16ac-dependent transcription regulation is likely a cell type specific process.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Nobuo Horikoshi"", ids = ""4853125""); list(name = ""Pankaj Kumar"", ids = ""1923625""); list(name = ""Girdhar G Sharma"", ids = ""4138977""); list(name = ""Min Chen"", ids = ""83359287""); list(name = ""Clayton R.

db41196b5c35adeafeb09132851ee64b722620cd,Transcriptional profiling of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae during iron depletion using microarrays.,"Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, the causative agent of swine enzootic pneumonia and a major component of the porcine respiratory disease complex, continues to confound swine producers despite control programmes worldwide. The disease is chronic and self-limiting, but the host is subject to immunopathological changes that potentiate respiratory disease associated with other pathogens. The response of M. hyopneumoniae to environmental stress is of interest because of its relevance to virulence mechanisms in other bacterial pathogens. One of these stressors, iron deprivation, is a prominent feature of the host innate immune response, and most certainly impacts growth of mycoplasmas in vivo. To study this, microarray technology was applied to the transcriptome analysis of M. hyopneumoniae during iron deprivation. An array consisting of 632 of the 698 ORFs in the genome was used to compare the mRNA isolated from organisms grown under normal laboratory conditions with that from organisms subjected to iron deprivation with the chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl. This analysis identified 27 genes that were either up- or down-regulated in response to low-iron growth conditions (P<0.01), with an estimated false discovery rate below 10 %. These included genes encoding transport proteins, enzymes involved in energy metabolism, and components of the translation process. Ten of the 27 identified genes had no assigned function.

2d5d5f55a8be4c965fb8ecb14d141f8d2e0bd1d1,Angiogenic-regulatory network revealed by molecular profiling heart tissue following Akt1 induction in endothelial cells,"Akt is a pivotal signaling molecule involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. In order to further elucidate the role of Akt1 in blood vessel development, a tetracycline-regulated transgenic system was utilized to conditionally activate Akt1 signaling in endothelial cells to examine transcript expression changes associated with angiogenesis in the heart. Induction of Akt1 over the course of 6Â weeks led to a 33% increase in capillary density without affecting overall heart growth. Transcript expression profiles in the hearts were analyzed with an Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Expression Set 430 2.0, which represents approximately 45,000 cDNAs and ESTs. A total of 248 transcripts were differentially expressed between transgenic and control mice (fold changeÂ >/<1.8; false discovery rateÂ <Â 0.1; PÂ <Â 0.01). A subset of these differentially expressed transcripts included angiogenic growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix proteins. More specifically, these transcripts included VEGF-receptor2, neuropilin-1, and connective tissue growth factor, each of which is implicated in blood vessel growth and the maintenance of vessel wall integrity. Furthermore, these factors may be involved in an autocrine-regulatory feedback system, one believed to promote vessel growth. Knowledge of these and other targets could be used to treat ischemic heart disease, a disease whose broad spectrum of manifestations range from patients with only effort-induced angina without myocardial damage, through stages of myocardial ischemia that are associated with reversible and irreversible impairment in left ventricular function, to states of irreversible myocardial injury and necrosis resulting in congestive heart failure (CHF).",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Stephan Schiekofer"", ids = ""48869026""); list(name = ""Kurt Belisle"", ids = ""11952953""); list(name = ""Gennaro Galasso"", ids = ""4923934""); list(name = ""Jochen G.

b30aabdca9ea614e35f9d30f379e5e5c84f55ff9,248 Epigenetic changes in firefighters,"Introduction Firefighters are exposed to carcinogens and have elevated cancer rates. Cancer may be caused by activation of oncogenes or inhibition of tumour suppressor genes, such as through alterations in microRNA (miRNA) concentrations and DNA methylation. We hypothesised that occupational exposures in firefighters would lead to epigenetic changes associated with activation of cancer pathways and increased cancer risk. We designed this study to compare epigenetic changes in incumbent firefighters and new recruits. Methods At the time of subject selection, the study population consisted of 119 incumbents and 70 recruits. From this group, 108 subjects were randomly selected for miRNA analysis and 96 for DNA methylation analysis, both evenly divided among incumbents and recruits. Only non-smoker male firefighters were included in the final comparison. MiRNAs and DNA methylation were measured with the nCounter Human v3 miRNA expression assay with over 828 miRNAs and the Illumina MethylationEPIC 850â€‰k chips, respectively. Result After adjusting for age and BMI, miR-1260a, miR-145â€“5â€‰p, miR-181c-5p, miR-331â€“3â€‰p, miR-361â€“5â€‰p, and miR584â€“3â€‰p were significantly downregulated in incumbent firefighters. MiR-208b-5p, miR-30e-3p, and miR-486â€“3â€‰p were significantly overexpressed in incumbents. Controlling the genome-wide false discovery rate at 5%, 22 CpGs were annotated to promoter regions of a gene and were hypermethylated in the incumbents including YIPF6, HELB, SYT5 and DVL2. Discussion MiR-181c-5p, miR-145â€“5â€‰p, and miR-584â€“3â€‰p are involved in tumour suppression. MiR-30e-3p is upregulated in skin cancer and is a poor prognostic factor in lung cancer. Co-amplification of the YIPF6 gene with the androgen receptor may stimulate prostate tumour progression. Aberrant activation of HELB reduces genomic stability, a hallmark of cancer. SYT may have a novel function in breast cancer. DVL2 is a part of the Wnt signalling pathway involved in multiple cancers. These epigenetic biomarkers of carcinogenic exposure in firefighters should be further evaluated in larger studies.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kyoung Sook Jeong"", ids = ""2725796""); list(name = ""Jin Hua Zhou"", ids = ""40029712""); list(name = ""Elizabeth Theresa Jacobs"", ids = ""144135287""); list(name = ""Stephanie C Griffin"", ids = ""143818776""); list(name = ""Sally R.

One of the widely used methods for protein identification is based on probabilistic approaches such as ProteinProphet and BaysPro. However, they do not consider the difference in peptide identification probabilities according to their length. Here, we propose a probabilistic graphical model-based approach to protein identification from MS/MS data considering peptide identification probabilities, number of sibling peptides, and peptide length. We compared our approach with ProteinProphet using a yeast MS/MS dataset. As a result, our model identified 27 more proteins than ProteinProphet at 1% of FDR (false discovery rate), confirming the importance of peptide length information in protein identification.",2012,Chemistry,"list(name = ""ì\235´í\231\215ëž\200"", ids = ""82400588""); list(name = ""í\231©ê·œë°±"", ids = ""66782472"")",,,,39,426-428
2f7629fd282412ab180d9a4974dfa4fec995656b,Floating prioritized subset analysis: A powerful method to detect differentially expressed genes,"Controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) is a powerful approach to deal with a large number of hypothesis tests, such as in gene expression data analyses and genome-wide association studies. To further boost power, here we propose a floating prioritized subset analysis (floating PSA) that can more effectively use prior knowledge and detect more genes that are differentially expressed. Genes are first allocated into two subsets: a prioritized subset and a non-prioritized subset, according to investigators' prior biological knowledge. We allow the FDRs of the two subsets to vary freely (to float) but aim to control the overall FDR at a desired level. An algorithm for the floating PSA is developed to detect the largest number of true positives. Theoretical justifications of the algorithm are given, and computer simulation studies show that the method has good statistical properties. We apply this method to detect genes that are differentially expressed between acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia patients. The result shows that our floating PSA identifies 32 more genes (permutation-based FDR=0.0427) than the conventional (fixed) FDR control. Another example is a colon cancer study, and our floating PSA identifies 43 more genes (permutation-based FDR=0.0502). The floating PSA method is to be recommended for the detection of differentially expressed genes, in light of its power, robustness, and ease of implementation.",2011,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Wan-Yu Lin"", ids = ""49661239""); list(name = ""Wen-Chung Lee"", ids = ""34044322"")",2ccdb5fcfe1078661e4f8e78ce45f834a31839a2,118fe39f9350c2cd378913a36c8371339ba733f2; 43672571687a874e559c9fbf1cf9dccf96a5cfdc; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b76d7daa280b13f2954af40f8b4e643853335ce0; 7123c6d5079e52914a57068ea28e73a548e31da1; 030af7f45b2a6295d1aa972a0b2d6fabff2741dc; 696d53207e68754491e3ebf34249cd4af4b51af7; 4f2b48d49c81233aba44396af5b9848f04ed283d; a15e1f238fc526b86c50ee0945b17ea2cee8fbdc; 5a4b1971d1e22575480639e083a69999a7348af3; 9a39e80d9bae8fb7b6b087c32e8357e2b9f101b7; 37105484cd8d8d92029602be0b91e0df156d37a2; 3f2d21ff9c3ccf6b0e7f4154ab1f9b81bdb7f62c; be8a0ffbda6b3dd8c1a1057d530d17003bc58c6c; 72bcd3b79db7b5a6747bf2d2204d20ab31767f54; 96842f8c99e7af018667dc9ff12e358fdc3de39a; eb28f67e71595042f364b99fd06504a3d4c4f823; 9416995e4f9c7e4c6377d4613ca9dc41f657517f; 779cfb846e753b8b70171313f4218089fc10221c; 5800894aa631837c684614c2e108da79f73af2a2; 7b073bd54b189ca4b895493d272050949aff4118; 4a85cb9aef902c32e3e1dbf3b42eb39dac057aba; 9b0136ea92bcfed01e8465e5f9484f8c8e5f98a8; b4c559217a28ec4ae55c7e20281270fb0b5bb623; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 0a682af815949f6f7aaade2fdcdcae3b5383c8e0; c13c4ac79c30ed5f5cbe4d9582cd7b84231ea07f; 6847ed805b3456a4fe14b15316c4cbb3db2dd99c; cb459017698a4bed20775ff0f52f959a296fac0a; 9a4f143682d5b61e41270599d633a18acd5f0442; 86499baa4fe7c2ddb51d2c194a871c5bf80c5b62; 0e6cc6ae61c0e3c30f13f8a9e933cd942c234eb2; 4a9eecb0b703eedeeb838dcba40726ace26e8550; 0cb64a5dc4b4ebca3a3e1d3d50c4ae74ce7c5af2; a25161bd5d9794b80d1709df3689cc3ce79f0f43; 1fb942ac44a55924b55b882a66c6327d34ed81bb; 481f6a8a8a41a36168dad3fe84939a0252ac5cc3; a6f2ed7bedaf1e20093cfec007b0f7377daaec4d; e82ecd58b664f3ee2b6a080b4ddb4080c39ad530; fabaca4bc51e52fdf3f289153d402148a5a0012e; dd1b3822a5d94e1de43845a9917be3e6a4ebfbe4; e719899fe160835ed27cc2679d2d8d2edebdcd21; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; 5c28b24b0ecb610c6a527b32c3acb2c03b1bc184; 671faa0432c0e4bfeef32e7731f7f5e191ebacfd; ce2605f83e604a55beafdc4bc003c5979c8d794a; f2795f9bf51c7951555be337901552d2a01e0d5d; 1db5c1d04f85e6886e51b6dde9bb047e2ace3334; d87bcd81c9347ed51bfef580f3357d5256d910f2; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 8db442188ef0c3d85ecc9c46f898ed8c1d9cde63; 9328c2d1fffd91094165cb3e86834bfa623ed009; 60cb8d855021d6378c53ee6f8dfee373a1e0eb15; bb3735e5646b1066933f1a7cc22c0a4a7fcfe27a; 80615137aa5039e01495d0a67a0617b6fe635019; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; 9ed39de2fd6afcb358b77ac8bbd6b4590f644b45; 4da6c8bb8b387a063cb648928a25c6bbb62d8d37,Comput.

7ed81c8f785fe97dcacd52cc375bcfcc16a876ae,ChIP-seq Analysis in R (CSAR): An R package for the statistical detection of protein-bound genomic regions,"BackgroundIn vivo detection of protein-bound genomic regions can be achieved by combining chromatin-immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing technology (ChIP-seq). The large amount of sequence data produced by this method needs to be analyzed in a statistically proper and computationally efficient manner. The generation of high copy numbers of DNA fragments as an artifact of the PCR step in ChIP-seq is an important source of bias of this methodology.ResultsWe present here an R package for the statistical analysis of ChIP-seq experiments. Taking the average size of DNA fragments subjected to sequencing into account, the software calculates single-nucleotide read-enrichment values. After normalization, sample and control are compared using a test based on the ratio test or the Poisson distribution. Test statistic thresholds to control the false discovery rate are obtained through random permutations. Computational efficiency is achieved by implementing the most time-consuming functions in C++ and integrating these in the R package. An analysis of simulated and experimental ChIP-seq data is presented to demonstrate the robustness of our method against PCR-artefacts and its adequate control of the error rate.ConclusionsThe software ChIP-seq Analysis in R (CSAR) enables fast and accurate detection of protein-bound genomic regions through the analysis of ChIP-seq experiments. Compared to existing methods, we found that our package shows greater robustness against PCR-artefacts and better control of the error rate.",2011,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jose M.

9f0696114f7c3868b9001084c023fdcba9c67cca,Genome-wide patterns of single-feature polymorphism in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"We used hybridization to the ATH1 gene expression array to interrogate genomic DNA diversity in 23 wild strains (accessions) of Arabidopsis thaliana (arabidopsis), in comparison with the reference strain Columbia (Col). At <1% false discovery rate, we detected 77,420 single-feature polymorphisms (SFPs) with distinct patterns of variation across the genome. Total and pair-wise diversity was higher near the centromeres and the heterochromatic knob region, but overall diversity was positively correlated with recombination rate (R(2) = 3.1%). The difference between total and pair-wise SFP diversity is a relative measure contrasting diversifying or frequency-dependent selection, similar to Tajima's D, and can be calibrated by the empirical genome-wide distribution. Each unique locus, centered on a gene, has a diversity and selection score that suggest a relative role in past evolutionary processes. Homologs of disease resistance (R) genes include members with especially high levels of diversity often showing frequency-dependent selection and occasionally evidence of a past selective sweep. Receptor-like and S-locus proteins also contained members with elevated levels of diversity and signatures of selection, whereas other gene families, bHLH, F-box, and RING finger proteins, showed more typical levels of diversity. SFPs identified with the gene expression array also provide an empirical hybridization polymorphism background for studies of gene expression polymorphism and are available through the genome browser http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/AtSFP.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Justin O.

Accordingly, the interpretation of ensuing hypothesis tests should manage the number of comparisons. For example, cDNA microarray experiments generate large multiplicity problems in which thousands of hypotheses are tested simultaneously. In this context, the false discovery rate (FDR) and false non-discovery rate (FNR) are used to account for multiple comparisons. In this study, we propose non-parametric estimates of FDR and FNR that are conceptually and computationally straightforward. Additionally, to illustrate their properties and use in a procedure for an optimum subset of significant tests, an example from a functional genomics study is presented.",2011,Biology,"list(name = ""Robert R.

34573ce54e0f2818e44d6a3e33bfe264b5875d84,Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) Sequencing Reveals Alterations of the Transcript Signatures in Acute Monocytic Leukemia Cells By Fatty Acid Oxidation Inhibition,"Adipocytes, differentiated from bone marrow (BM) stroma-resident mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), are the prevalent stromal cell type in adult BM that increase with aging and cause leukemia cell resistance to chemotherapy (Ehsanipour Cancer Res. 2013) .

We previously reported that MSC-derived adipocytes prominently inhibited the spontaneous apoptosis of co-cultured acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL) cells, a poor-prognosis subtype of AML, and that a pharmacologic fatty acid oxidation (FAO) inhibitor Etomoxir (EX) reversed the prosurvival effects of adipocytes, indicating the importance of FAO dependent metabolic alterations in AMoL survival (Tabe ASH. 2014) .

To assess the transcription factors responsible for AMoL cell survival in adipocyte co-culture condition and for apoptosis induction by FAO inhibition, the alterations of transcript signatures were examined by the cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) sequencing utilizing second-generation sequencing platform (Illumina Genome Analyzer). CAGE identifies and quantifies the 5' ends of capped mRNA transcripts, which enables the identification of transcription start sites (TSS) and allows investigating promoter structures necessary for gene expression (Carninci et al. 1996). The TSS of genes altered in U937 and THP1 cells co-cultured with adipocytes in the presence or absence of EX were mapped, and the common alterations observed in both cell types were analyzed. CAGE detected upregulation of 366 genes and downregulation of 219 genes after co-culture with adipocytes (false discovery rate, < 0.05). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that adipocyte co-culture activated the cancer associated transcription factors Myc and FOXM1, and inhibited the p53 transcription regulator IFI16 and FLT1 kinase, an upstream positive regulator of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling. After EX treatment, CAGE-IPA analysis implicated inhibition of the FAO initiation enzyme ACOX1, and activation of the transcription factor ATF4 (Activating Transcription Factor 4), the master coordinator of the integrated stress response (ISR), and of the nuclear receptor PPARG which controls the FAO pathway.

To narrow down the specific transcription factors responsible for EX induced apoptosis in AMoL cells co-cultured with adipocytes, CAGE-mapped TTS signature was integrated with the gene expression patterns detected by RNA-seq.

CAGE and RNA-seq detected 3 genes consistently upregulated by adipocyte co-culture ( KLF9 ; a transcription factor that activates PPARg2 promoter, FKBP5 ; HSP90 interacting co-chaperone immunophilin protein , ATP13A2 ; a member of the P5 subfamily of ATPases) and downregulation of 2 genes ( ANPEP ; known as CD13 or Alanyl Aminopeptidase, SLC39A10 ; Zinc transporter which involves in lipid metabolism).

EX treatment under adipocyte co-culture condition specifically upregulated 12 genes including ISR mediator ATF4 and its target gene TRIB3 . The upregulation of asparagine syntheses gene ASNS, known to be induced by ATF4, was also detected by RNA-seq. Concordant with CAGE-IPA results, EX treatment upregulated lipid accumulation marker PLIN2 and PPARG target of fatty acid binding protein FABP4 likely reflecting the direct feedback of FAO inhibition. Two genes were downregulated by EX treatment ( SREBP1 ; the lipogenic transcription factor, P2RY2 ; G-protein coupled receptor activated by ATP).

Finally, capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE-MS) detected the upregulation of citric acid by adipocyte co-culture, which was significantly depleted after EX treatment. The EX treatment, however, increased lactic acid along with fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate upregulation, indicating that cellular metabolism shifts from oxidative phosphorylation and FAO to anaerobic glycolysis which is known to activate ISR.

Taken together, this study demonstrates that FAO inhibition by EX activates the pro-apoptotic transcriptional program of ISR through the up-regulation of ATF4 in adipocyte co-cultured AMoL cells. The strategies targeting FAO warrant further exploration in AMoL that survives in adipocyte abundant aged adult BM.

a005f53c06c3dfe4c4a9f26b95af3729546e441f,Epigenomeâ€Wide Association Study of Dietary Fiber Intake in African American Adolescents,"SCOPE
Low fiber intake is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Two hypotheses are tested: 1) dietary fiber would be associated with DNA methylation levels; 2) those DNA methylation changes would be associated with visceral adiposity and inflammation. Also the possibility that the associations between fiber and DNA methylation levels might be confounded with folic acid intake as sensitivity analysis are explored.


METHODS AND RESULTS
An epigenome-wide association study is conducted using Illumina 450K Bead-Chip on leukocyte DNA in 284 African American adolescents. Linear regression is performed to identify differentially methylated CpG sites associated with fiber. The methylation levels of 3 CpG sites (cg15200711, cg19462022, and cg07035602) in LPCAT1 and RASA3 genes are associated with fiber (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) after adjustment for covariates including folic acid. The methylation levels of cg07035602 and cg19462022 are also associated with visceral adiposity and inflammation.


CONCLUSIONS
The data show that DNA methylation levels at LPCAT1 and RASA3 genes are associated with dietary fiber intake as well as with adiposity and inflammation. Future studies are warranted to determine whether epigenetic regulation may underlie the beneficial effects of fiber intake on adiposity and inflammation.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Li Chen"", ids = ""49330592""); list(name = ""Yanbin Dong"", ids = ""3333988""); list(name = ""Xiaoling Wang"", ids = ""40509071""); list(name = ""G Hao"", ids = ""144315329""); list(name = ""Ying Huang"", ids = ""49866474""); list(name = ""Bernard Gutin"", ids = ""5335700""); list(name = ""Haidong Zhu"", ids = ""38448191"")",928e2ebdac92e403e4e7bb97ffb3b18134e86fe2; 88d1006d47ec56a55f179983799a7410dbc0e556,bdc3d618db015b2f17cd76224a942bfdfc36dc73,Molecular Nutrition & Food Research,62,&NA;

We have previously demonstrated that patients with PSC-UC have significant alterations in their gut microbiota compared to patients with UC alone and healthy controls. The mechanisms by which these alterations influence pathogenesis is unclear. Methods Shotgun sequencing was performed on whole transcriptomic libraries of colon biopsies obtained from 10 patients with PSC-UC and 10 healthy controls. Differential gene expression analysis with false discovery rate correction was performed with limma and edgeR. In addition lamina propria mononuclear cells were analysed by multicolour flow cytometry. Results The colonic transcriptome of patients with PSC-UC demonstrated 6774 significantly differentially expressed genes compared to healthy controls. Gene expression in PSC-UC clustered separate to healthy controls on multidimensional scaling (p=0.006). Gene enrichment analysis revealed 280 significantly altered biological processes. PSC-UC was characterised by an overexpression of processes associated with regulation of anti-microbial immune responses compared to healthy controls (p<0.0001). These immunological responses were enriched with pathways associated with innate, cell-mediated and humoral immunity, autophagy, complement activation and chemokine signalling (p<0.0001). Expression of genes associated with microbial handling including defensins, mannose receptors and anti-microbial peptides were significantly upregulated in PSC-UC. Paired CD4 T cell immunophenotyping of colon biopsies revealed a significant increase in the population of Th17 cells and IL-17 producing cells in PSC-UC in comparison to healthy controls (18.6% vs 8.5%; p=0.0007 8.5%â€‰vs 5.6%; p=0.005â€‰respectively). Conclusion We have for the first time demonstrated the colonic mucosal transcriptional response in PSC-UC. In comparison to healthy controls, patients with PSC-UC have highly significant expression of genes associated with over-representation of multiple immunological processes, many of which are directed against bacteria. Consistently patients with PSC-UC have a significant increase in colonic mucosal Th17 and IL-17 cell population compared to healthy controls.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mohammed Nabil Quraishi"", ids = ""145417647""); list(name = ""Andrew D.

ba7e64a20eee35cf66568d3446619c71c7f747ca,Deep Sequencing of the Porcine Endometrial Transcriptome on Day 14 of Pregnancy1,"ABSTRACT In pigs, conceptus attachment to the uterine surface epithelium starts around Day 14 of pregnancy preceded by a pronounced vascularization at the implantation zones, initiating the epitheliochorial placentation. To characterize the complex transcriptome changes in the endometrium in the course of initial conceptus attachment, deep sequencing of endometrial RNA samples of pregnant animals (n = 4) and corresponding cyclic controls (n = 4) was performed using Illumina RNA-Seq. The obtained sequence reads were mapped to the porcine genome, and relative expression values were calculated for the analysis of differential gene expression. Statistical analysis revealed 1933 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate 1%), 1229 with higher and 704 with lower mRNA concentration, in the samples from pregnant animals. Expression of selected genes was validated by the use of quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The RNA-Seq data were compared to results of a microarray study of bovine endometrium on Day 18 of pregnancy and additional related data sets. Bioinformatics analysis revealed for the genes with higher mRNA concentration in pregnant samples strong overrepresentation, particularly for immune-related functional terms but also for apoptosis and cell adhesion. Overrepresented terms for the genes with lower mRNA concentration in pregnant samples were related to extracellular region, ion transport, cell adhesion, and lipid and steroid metabolic process.

Applying this technology with high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays allows precise localization of transcription factor binding in the whole-genome scale [1, 2]. A typical tiling array chip contains 4 Ã— 105 DNA probes (oligonucleotide of 25â€“100 bp long) tiled at every 30â€“100 bp on the genome. ChIP-Chip data is thus an array of hybridization intensities measured from the ordered probes. Large intensity values are called peaks, and the probe locations of these peaks indicate the most likely positions of proteinâ€“DNA binding. The task is therefore to find statistically significantly large peaks and their corresponding locations on the genome, which is referred to as peak-calling. Probe intensities of multiple adjacent probes are positively correlated due to the large size of sheared DNA fragments. As a result, regions containing many large values of hybridization intensities are more likely to cover a true proteinâ€“DNA binding site than regions containing just a single peak. The positive correlation structure of adjacent probes raises a statistically challenging problem for estimating the significance of peaks under the context of multiple testings. The well-known Bonferroni method is too conservative for estimating the family-wise type I error rate in peakcalling, because the method assumes independence between tests. Alternatively, one may want to control the false discovery rate (FDR) introduced by Benjamini and Hochberg [3]. However, when tests are positively correlated, the estimated proportion of false rejections can have large variability. More importantly, significant peaks tend to be clustered, making the usual FDR control on individual tests inappropriate.",2010,Physics,"list(name = ""Yu Zhang"", ids = ""145954572"")",,,,,371-381

We conducted a genome-wide analysis of RNA stability in seven human HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and analyzed the effect of DNA sequence variation on RNA half-life differences. Twenty-six percent of the expressed genes exhibited RNA half-life differences between LCLs at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, which accounted for ~ 37% of the gene expression differences between individuals. Nonsense polymorphisms were associated with reduced RNA half-lives. In genes presenting interindividual RNA half-life differences, higher coding GC3 contents (G and C percentages at the third-codon positions) were correlated with increased RNA half-life. Consistently, G and C alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in protein coding sequences were associated with enhanced RNA stability. These results suggest widespread interindividual differences in RNA stability related to DNA sequence and composition variation.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jubao Duan"", ids = ""88756317""); list(name = ""Jianxin Shi"", ids = ""3945608""); list(name = ""Xijin Ge"", ids = ""48527606""); list(name = ""Lars DÃ¶lken"", ids = ""3119449""); list(name = ""Winton Moy"", ids = ""2752086""); list(name = ""Deli He"", ids = ""40025720""); list(name = ""Sandra Shi"", ids = ""14069292""); list(name = ""Alan R.

7e31e4d80ec73ba720876e925ecfdff597cc3cae,Identification of fetal and maternal single nucleotide polymorphisms in candidate genes that predispose to spontaneous preterm labor with intact membranes.,"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to determine whether maternal/fetal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes are associated with spontaneous preterm labor/delivery.


STUDY DESIGN
A genetic association study was conducted in 223 mothers and 179 fetuses (preterm labor with intact membranes who delivered <37 weeks of gestation [preterm birth (PTB)]), and 599 mothers and 628 fetuses (normal pregnancy); 190 candidate genes and 775 SNPs were studied. Single locus/haplotype association analyses were performed; the false discovery rate was used to correct for multiple testing.


RESULTS
The strongest single locus associations with PTB were interleukin-6 receptor 1 (fetus; P=.000148) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (mother; P=.000197), which remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Global haplotype analysis indicated an association between a fetal DNA variant in insulin-like growth factor F2 and maternal alpha 3 type IV collagen isoform 1 (global, P=.004 and .007, respectively).


CONCLUSION
An SNP involved in controlling fetal inflammation (interleukin-6 receptor 1) and DNA variants in maternal genes encoding for proteins involved in extracellular matrix metabolism approximately doubled the risk of PTB.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Roberto Romero"", ids = ""145783393""); list(name = ""Digna R.

8abf70ed193fc6e48b2adf107233ad9364729331,The discovery of novel predictive biomarkers and early-stage pathophysiology for the transition from gestational diabetes to type 2 diabetes,"Aims/hypothesisGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects up to 20% of pregnancies, and almost half of the women affected progress to type 2 diabetes later in life, making GDM the most significant risk factor for the development of future type 2 diabetes. An accurate prediction of future type 2 diabetes risk in the early postpartum period after GDM would allow for timely interventions to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. In addition, new targets for interventions may be revealed by understanding the underlying pathophysiology of the transition from GDM to type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study is to identify both a predictive signature and early-stage pathophysiology of the transition from GDM to type 2 diabetes.MethodsWe used a well-characterised prospective cohort of women with a history of GDM pregnancy, all of whom were enrolled at 6â€“9Â weeks postpartum (baseline), were confirmed not to have diabetes via 2 h 75 g OGTT and tested anually for type 2 diabetes on an ongoing basis (2Â years of follow-up). A large-scale targeted lipidomic study was implemented to analyse ~1100 lipid metabolites in baseline plasma samples using a nested pair-matched caseâ€“control design, with 55 incident cases matched to 85 non-case control participants. The relationships between the concentrations of baseline plasma lipids and respective follow-up status (either type 2 diabetes or no type 2 diabetes) were employed to discover both a predictive signature and the underlying pathophysiology of the transition from GDM to type 2 diabetes. In addition, the underlying pathophysiology was examined in vivo and in vitro.ResultsMachine learning optimisation in a decision tree format revealed a seven-lipid metabolite type 2 diabetes predictive signature with a discriminating power (AUC) of 0.92 (87% sensitivity, 93% specificity and 91% accuracy). The signature was highly robust as it includes 45-fold cross-validation under a high confidence threshold (1.0) and binary output, which together minimise the chance of data overfitting and bias selection. Concurrent analysis of differentially expressed lipid metabolite pathways uncovered the upregulation of Î±-linolenic/linoleic acid metabolism (false discovery rate [FDR] 0.002) and fatty acid biosynthesis (FDR 0.005) and the downregulation of sphingolipid metabolism (FDR 0.009) as being strongly associated with the risk of developing future type 2 diabetes.

An AD genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset that included 370,542 SNPs in 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls of European descent was used in this study. Identify Candidate Causal SNPs and Pathway (ICSNPathway) analysis was applied to the GWAS dataset. ICSNPathway analysis identified 3 candidate SNPs and 2 pathways, which provided 3 hypothetical biological mechanisms. The strongest hypothetical biological mechanism was rs8076604 [non-synonymous coding (deleterious)] to MYO18A to negative regulation of programmed cell death [nominal PÂ <Â 0.001, false discovery rate (FDR) <0.043]. The second was rs2811226 (regulatory region) to ANXA1 to negative regulation of programmed cell death (nominal PÂ <Â 0.001, FDR 0.043). The third was rs3734166 (non-synonymous coding) to CDC25C to M phase of the mitotic cell cycle (nominal PÂ <Â 0.001, FDR 0.049). By applying the ICSNPathway analysis to the AD GWAS meta-analysis data, three candidate SNPs, three genes (MYO18A, ANXA1, CDC25C), 2 pathways involving negative regulation of programmed cell death and 1 pathway involving the M phase of the mitotic cell cycle were identified, which may contribute to AD susceptibility.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Youngseop Lee"", ids = ""1766894""); list(name = ""Gwan Gyu Song"", ids = ""5157481"")",77b766506bc5292b406ad6a607e4a54fbdd84e45; 55e860703b47d8cc1a3695fafdcc602d68f50828,90381d538e5751eaba07a8fa659cfa5fe21b92fd; f57c95878e9d5e9b6464a01a55e473258ee163a1; e18f7c20c89feaba2adeb95f1def7124fdb21381; 5e54f0a1bda9c1134c0f64f9ad266b44773a9783; 103d49ecd1476503e23924fb09114a5b61f55a66; cddf87d75bef4b32bce91c16260bf274fb01d434; b4238bd7a62fa86322f0596c7854c72e8bb218ad; ffa15df5b6f1574c4fd0b6a91802bf1774f841b1; 942f9be51d640cea1ffc1aa638722a4f765ca5a6; 587616382c80926d1ce5c0b49c1b3f792c05aabe; 6d623e92030a13dbd87ad6e99dc83b1e773f4320; 5aa273d1db8662b5594ff2dcaeee279187f636b9; b16ec27762024efef5d158e61960cb28f1a3e642; 27d57f0c4e0d6bb9c39de107e12a9d4c977cec3c; ec78210c6207c179b0b3704573f4f116945004b7; 601a0aae8b6aa41d089083e1b5cadff5468f20c8; a55bc18446e4209453c08a8d8ceb2f4a4a3a8977; ec18289446c8d300d3ac1e8dbce8b81baf2ca00a; ee5eafb1aa3c4ec1ed908a0c5448016a53bf80cf; 681face3b0017800f93a381ef6d1936cba0cc333; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 00ed2b89723b638941d8a87eb1c642eb98817add; 6480039b32988cf83bde873263b09897e14d551e; 89670fb58cfe88627477dd83be8bdf7a138f2127,Neurological Sciences,36,53-59
2e21c1f97de9237edd9c18c851656a0d9f543a38,Age-related variations in gene expression patterns of renal cell carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is known to occur across the adult lifetime traversing the spectrum of age-related organismal changes. Little is known as to how the aging process may affect the course of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the repertoire of genes involved.


METHODS
Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (nâ€¯=â€¯436) and Cancer Genomics of the Kidney (nâ€¯=â€¯89) datasets, we applied regression analysis to examine associations between patient age and gene expression profiles in ccRCC tumors and normal kidney tissues. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed to identify cellular process that is affected by aging in ccRCC. Moreover, connectivity mapping analysis was used to predict age-dependent response to drug treatments.


RESULTS
Our analysis revealed different age-dependent gene expression spectra in ccRCC and normal kidney tissues. These findings were significant and independently reproducible in both datasets examined. Age up-regulated genes, showing higher expression in older patients, were significantly enriched (false discovery rate <0.05) in normal tissues for pathways associated with immune response and extracellular matrix organization, whereas age up-regulated genes in tumors were enriched for metabolism and oxidation pathways. Strikingly, age down-regulated genes in normal cells were also enriched for metabolism and oxidation, while those in tumors were enriched for extracellular matrix organization. Further in silico analysis of potential drug targets predicted preferential efficacy of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor or immunotherapy in association with age.


CONCLUSION
We report on previously unrecognized associations between age and molecular underpinnings of RCC, including age-associated expression of genes implicated in RCC development or treatment.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lara Feulner"", ids = ""51998742""); list(name = ""Hamed S.

The neurophysiological basis of pain relief due to spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and the related cortical processing of sensory information are not completely understood. The aim of this study was to use resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to detect changes in cortical networks and cortical processing related to the stimulator-induced pain relief.


METHODS
Ten patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) or neuropathic leg pain underwent thoracic epidural spinal cord stimulator implantation. Stimulation parameters associated with ""optimal"" pain reduction were evaluated prior to imaging studies. Rs-fMRI was obtained on a 3 Tesla, Philips Achieva MRI. Rs-fMRI was performed with stimulator off (300TRs) and stimulator at optimum (Opt, 300 TRs) pain relief settings. Seed-based analysis of the resting state functional connectivity was conducted using seeds in regions established as participating in pain networks or in the default mode network (DMN) in addition to the network analysis. NCUT (normalized cut) parcellation was used to generate 98 cortical and subcortical regions of interest in order to expand our analysis of changes in functional connections to the entire brain. We corrected for multiple comparisons by limiting the false discovery rate to 5%.


RESULTS
Significant differences in resting state connectivity between SCS off and optimal state were seen between several regions related to pain perception, including the left frontal insula, right primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, as well as in regions involved in the DMN, such as the precuneus. In examining changes in connectivity across the entire brain, we found decreased connection strength between somatosensory and limbic areas and increased connection strength between somatosensory and DMN with optimal SCS resulting in pain relief. This suggests that pain relief from SCS may be reducing negative emotional processing associated with pain, allowing somatosensory areas to become more integrated into default mode activity.


CONCLUSION
SCS reduces the affective component of pain resulting in optimal pain relief. Study shows a decreased connectivity between somatosensory and limbic areas associated with optimal pain relief due to SCS.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Milind Deogaonkar"", ids = ""5059960""); list(name = ""Mayur Sharma"", ids = ""3282932""); list(name = ""Chima O.

7f50c4265aad6b2b7b7a016522fab094d90e7723,Statistical Modelling of Gene Expression Data,"A key challenge for statisticians dealing with microarray experiments is to develop statistical models and procedures that are both honest reflections of the many sources of variability present in such experiments as well as fast algorithms to be able to give answers in real time. We argue that this requires a keen understanding of biological and physical processes as well as a pragmatic mix of statistical procedures. Smoothed versions of the background are ideal to normalize raw gene expression data. These normalized data can then be piped into various inference tools, depending on the question of interest. We propose to model the normalized data via hierarchical Bayesian models. Differentially expressed genes can be detected by calculating posterior activation probabilities and linking them to false discovery rates. We suggest a dynamic hierarchical model for time series data that is superior over typical clustering algorithms that ignore the time-structure of the data.",2002,,"list(name = ""Ernst Wit"", ids = ""145328435"")",,961e2156d523e3901c491cc2a1f65764c976fc44; d42337ecab378287fbcd60b42e5ceb5b67b6f59a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 65c4f601132902530ff0217b21e321e9c7e7812a; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; f164e28a81d018dbe59d8ef5017cb9e9484c9316; e3df93eb425d83dd0342aa59a1fa9045d111637e; 6ce7876c0b2acb52b88610ce9cfe21d239c28922; 686abad29d835044cf97434c3c0fb9f80321c856,,,
9592a764ed0ff3a35f056b564e30d52a5740bc6c,Comparison of normalization methods for the analysis of metagenomic gene abundance data,"BackgroundIn shotgun metagenomics, microbial communities are studied through direct sequencing of DNA without any prior cultivation. By comparing gene abundances estimated from the generated sequencing reads, functional differences between the communities can be identified. However, gene abundance data is affected by high levels of systematic variability, which can greatly reduce the statistical power and introduce false positives. Normalization, which is the process where systematic variability is identified and removed, is therefore a vital part of the data analysis. A wide range of normalization methods for high-dimensional count data has been proposed but their performance on the analysis of shotgun metagenomic data has not been evaluated.ResultsHere, we present a systematic evaluation of nine normalization methods for gene abundance data. The methods were evaluated through resampling of three comprehensive datasets, creating a realistic setting that preserved the unique characteristics of metagenomic data. Performance was measured in terms of the methods ability to identify differentially abundant genes (DAGs), correctly calculate unbiased p-values and control the false discovery rate (FDR). Our results showed that the choice of normalization method has a large impact on the end results. When the DAGs were asymmetrically present between the experimental conditions, many normalization methods had a reduced true positive rate (TPR) and a high false positive rate (FPR). The methods trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) and relative log expression (RLE) had the overall highest performance and are therefore recommended for the analysis of gene abundance data. For larger sample sizes, CSS also showed satisfactory performance.ConclusionsThis study emphasizes the importance of selecting a suitable normalization methods in the analysis of data from shotgun metagenomics. Our results also demonstrate that improper methods may result in unacceptably high levels of false positives, which in turn may lead to incorrect or obfuscated biological interpretation.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mariana Buongermino Pereira"", ids = ""36614665""); list(name = ""Mikael Wallroth"", ids = ""34843980""); list(name = ""Viktor Jonsson"", ids = ""22191062""); list(name = ""Erik Kristiansson"", ids = ""2871558"")",4376bacc80ec829aee5c112f042f53da5b849423; 3b46e1eae760582d16f035a82abed12b53482ef1; aad1fc5bfdf70c745eb1a5d71a6d629a1462a503; c4de942eeabf55f4009510127abbb59a6e17830d; 0539e51ffa78d5559839940a69f5b21c32e27f07; 7a5293e8bd48002d2623f8601b76fe31509e6fc3; f48623cb5a7672ab473c855602f01c38c05c9119; f6504f56649d0fdf449768eba336c5b475f44531; 0e00b755db14855f78e93aee47dc61b714562e3d; 72b73932204dff97cd4f4b129ef722f3cd55a927; 3174b7ee30446a98bb5eb00997828066663e16e3; 8db586e7c66548c4fc7abd5b4ba9f3a2eaf04d58; 78f0c84d86f1692329ba8c0e10b480075881adcd; 1fe7e5513a3de2204891ce80f69e5d6a963b33b6; cfcdce4507bcc8747b83a21e7cfdbd435be4d735; f34fd1d7c8ac10115c54fa17a81ac7eac6cc2b50; 8e9ed492fd3d944b6ff4621077e06b535d52ed05; e9730985cb61550f88c86fee3b112da5f0a7a870; 5d4d59668e945dd536e33da3b149524dbe0502a2,ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 90947c64553041bb83ce5fd97e7782a75ce77d25; 3087a4df677c7bcd80a495c7463834a3bdd6a80f; f0a44f81e82c4301f10354fd986d3201d9dc0544; 6afedec7f4521da1cc110d8d434682c3e4b44660; ddf303100649ad7c66d17119de7ac00b41e466d7; 4c638a9a35da889e67eaacb7ce15d2c450f0833b; 08a4a18fb93411dbebd40a597d2ff7863461fc0d; b640e86d2f1390f4c31c32a6beb5ad5164d219b8; 15f01639258bea481f8110acca659e55970f12ce; 0446839238dc22746e99eb746ce11bc7e18f33b1; b695cb5a9718ca530aba8b2a2174657d4996d4e8; fe5684e177987cfccde60c51e7c40c70c2e22cd4; 49f16b30d2c9495332fa537d337bf5e4425c213f; 54f0c3d233d3ea7f6849bfc9eb4427daaa16384e; 3bf35b1cc0cfd28c46d7de17a283325817adc2d5; a6e0739455352b0be05e22548bff81f5b1f80788; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; 59bde7b3624469ed5913f6026b9c1a81985fe81d; 3df1fa0df08efb0da6d0c64aadb9ff20c6f28024; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; f15c920476c1dc852236c9b6037004c2df841a46; 2bbb05640a79fb9704fb62289eb2de81ee154b7e; a91e23981e1a6dd827f427a4d6c9cdbcd0d7dd55; c4c5d67f8d044cc6de83ab8497b987390b5e2d60; b2d88e0e2274ad3d6807ace7aab25b30da1f7ef7; 7a1dce08895f9304c7bc1d225fbb80e6f9c808c7; b6998ff3cfe3ae51d66213a3783e34ce1fd9861d; 817fc8de25f989b8229847fc7710750f273460b6; 0a1144d37d5478f15bfc7797363dd029941ed26b; e59c774aec4c867504721ba1a81908b7e2e9ad0b; 825f8fd395d5951cb1ec493d706e1541ec159009; 772b2000e190984ca646016c527a86c3976b307e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 0e4ef9fe745155f4711d453fbb1e84a88d1042bf; 3cd8314bb4b869b5d6667cfcb236691a955e7ac0; e7f54e6e3fec0bbe5479fe286e1094becbc49030; 6c2b30e91795ea9dd444a0d87aee0ad8e0012d68; 8bb4a29289c64e4356925cd5ff3fb5648247c6d6; db5c2e755d8353e04993fa6721aa911bdda98f2a; 3eb62470cdba6f601cbc60c08057211d44fe587a; 09b8665b39779c59bf8cd1cb69b1b4e7e182e848; bd1ffea7381c9a95ae114143bc786d4d5ffc9eca; bcd46ef62de3963f1c6519d5de2fe80cbb1a75b7; 978c3c8d800514db93cf307eb3cab560803e75db; a80ba5b7c4ea6551a6f4ab64fde15819125bd1cb; 50fa3fa765dd7cbb472d1e594f8f3a1a460c5a38; 54a6d777e3a84e46f1c74bc9a0482a7307bd79c7; 54c79898d732e4e34e6ab4f7f5f646b304645c54; d46f5c8d7dfadf3093e017a9019034d0a0a39a50; 1a3555826ef68df33933414fb8a0724ad715e97d; 08c7ebde2c2bbb53093d7c5a456424443cb54b7d,BMC Genomics,19,
807bd893ef10743cf6940fa584ddd530b33c869b,Causal network analysis of head and neck keloid tissue identifies potential master regulators.,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS
To generate novel insights and hypotheses in keloid development from potential master regulators.


STUDY DESIGN
Prospective cohort.


METHODS
Six fresh keloid and six normal skin samples from 12 anonymous donors were used in a prospective cohort study. Genome-wide profiling was done previously on the cohort using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The 190 statistically significant CpG islands between keloid and normal tissue mapped to 152 genes (P < .05). The top 10 statistically significant genes (VAMP5, ACTR3C, GALNT3, KCNAB2, LRRC61, SCML4, SYNGR1, TNS1, PLEKHG5, PPP1R13-Î±, false discovery rate <.015) were uploaded into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software's Causal Network Analysis (QIAGEN, Redwood City, CA). To reflect expected gene expression direction in the context of methylation changes, the inverse of the methylation ratio from keloid versus normal tissue was used for the analysis. Causal Network Analysis identified disease-specific master regulator molecules based on downstream differentially expressed keloid-specific genes and expected directionality of expression (hypermethylated vs. hypomethylated).


RESULTS
Causal Network Analysis software identified four hierarchical networks that included four master regulators (pyroxamide, tributyrin, PRKG2, and PENK) and 19 intermediate regulators.


CONCLUSIONS
Causal Network Analysis of differentiated methylated gene data of keloid versus normal skin demonstrated four causal networks with four master regulators. These hierarchical networks suggest potential driver roles for their downstream keloid gene targets in the pathogenesis of the keloid phenotype, likely triggered due to perturbation/injury to normal tissue.

Due to the similarity of the results from the different datasets, the ensemble mean is then used in this study. After applying the false discovery rate to the significance test, the composite results reveal that positive Western Pacific (WP) events, East Atlantic (EA) events, Scandinavian (SCA) events, and Eastern Atlantic/Western Russia (EAWR) events are the teleconnection events that have an influence on SAT anomalies over southern China. The timing of inducing significant SAT anomalies over southern China is similar among positive WPevents, EA events and EAWR events, i.e., approximately the first 5-day period after their peak day. In contrast, SCA events exert a lagged significant influence on SAT, i.e., during approximately the second 6-day period after their peak day. Therefore, considering that significant circulation anomalies generally begin to appear at least 4 days before the peak day, these teleconnection events could be used as subseasonal predictors for SAT anomalies over southern China.",2019,Physics,"list(name = ""Ning Shi"", ids = ""47891223""); list(name = ""Dongdong Zhang"", ids = ""51091068""); list(name = ""Yicheng Wang"", ids = list()); list(name = ""Suolang Tajie"", ids = ""1478415657"")",,c6d409653e94acd9c8cd5320cb81d09e4279db96; 1e5d58f9bc7fbd60956e2fa484a0c2612e02bd5e; 9b4c060cf9e70a881732e31fec0936185adaa076; a37df410e3fcb1fa17fc17de2908b90ace894cd9; 57b8445c7fcac62ca09b98093662cc78083f7336; f95b245d5266ba81adf1400b9b9d73ade1d09612; 2eb0c00905547bb796d10dc967f3baae02bd90c4; 543bd4e3b34bc5a37669ecd48639d68c3246853d; 10cddc00f358d4b086eb6f8c62670687407d2363; 68899a91ac01d3763a9f72687cb0ddff5f9ec1c5; 1e26c732c5e4fe578d14e42be3ab02304c3192bb; 052843a5534db96ff4fdce3e8dad159344037976; bd8424eff4c56f34a458ec52ad403e6bb4703192; 9245626a0f2fb1087da713310a6c21ad284f2211; a865c2af852c11d2b3d47bdd455c6434ebc16075; be21796bc5a537a4f240d5328ba586094b903789; e778fe674be3287901904011ead03534c6d58034; a68088b6283ee870d3b999e8c5b6f8042d55f72e; a5ae711b5d218e151dfa1f1635099478a3e78615; c8ed3d1255a0cf2b783574c49651117cd84bd538; ec0f6eff63a49226941a7c3ccae88fb4829053dc; e65f50ac7e605e407b0fe5a352931025a2fe049b; d161285a3ca741e125e66b53bf30ed3fccb998a9; 4eb939ff5e4928c8d733cf901d3f6f0e03b070c4; dcf406177c4f5d1fe8a9134ff818bc731532efc8; 2dc8a803515c2129c2516a30ee605a10b46dea14; f56d3d0c1fe47cc3bb7e739bbe2fec2a33762916; 7f82f482d2bd431af947e795c2c7a01cf37fe8ad; 201b76815c9efc63b534b3c20c23423b72b6ec4f; 02d6f44a00b2e55867fc0feab6f6be0e5874cf9c; 25134b043f4184233af3f6898ecd5d9b7eba7738; 4c805f01afbcdb183411a9cb991fadcdac10971f; 3897e23e842805da26f3a8dfc8c3074c1ae275f5; ea0f9a712957c23dc575ada9ec0c00e11e1eeb5c; 7b463417b2b4620eef6ceb82b3f8bbeae3bb0108; 536b00978fc9cb37356cf74733c2a6d95f95b42c; 3dc29e0c016aa3e4e2bc838bd12bb041523ed1b5; 2c99a3c9d57403e46b7d47f494c8de8d22915f0f; d8daff37499fec962714c0892dff1ac4f2da8566; 9975cb0776e9afde69d1146f2b35a9924acb02bc; d3ac407e3dcf5a852bf5ba51cec04fb0b78fa04b; 3688e9a82f2de49dbbbb629cb64530f6c776f68e; 7ffdcb679a8475afc8c5faf7b0dfd93ed529dcd3,Atmosphere,10,514
6199fe0c09a15ab0565d5e37cf4665eee9446355,Dietary quality and the colonic mucosa-associated gut microbiome in humans.,"BACKGROUND
Despite tremendous interest in modulating the microbiome to improve health, the association between diet and the colonic mucosa-associated gut microbiome in healthy individuals has not been examined.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate the associations between Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005 and the colonic mucosa-associated microbiota.


METHODS
In this cross-sectional observational study, we analyzed bacterial community composition and structure using 16S rRNA gene (V4 region) sequencing of 97 colonic mucosal biopsies obtained endoscopically from different colon segments of 34 polyp-free participants. Dietary consumption was ascertained using an FFQ. Differences in Î±- and Î²-diversity and taxonomic relative abundances between the higher and lower score of total HEI and its components were compared, followed by multivariable analyses.


RESULTS
The structure of the microbiota significantly differed by the scores for total HEI, total and whole fruits (HEI 1 and HEI 2), whole grains (HEI 6), milk products and soy beverages (HEI 7), and solid fat, alcohol, and added sugar (HEI 12). A lower score for total HEI and HEIs 2, 7, and 12 was associated with significantly lower richness. A lower score for total HEI was associated with significantly reduced relative abundance of Parabacteroides, Roseburia, and Subdoligranulum but higher Fusobacterium. A lower score for HEI 2 was associated with lower Roseburia but higher Bacteroides. A lower score for HEI 7 was associated with lower Faecalibacterium and Fusobacterium but higher Bacteroides. A lower score for HEI 12 was associated with lower Subdoligranulum but higher Escherichia and Fusobacterium (false discovery rate-adjusted P valuesÂ <0.05). The findings were confirmed by multivariate analysis. Less abundant bacteria such as Alistipes, Odoribacter, Bilophila, and Tyzzerella were also associated with dietary quality.


CONCLUSIONS
A lower score for total HEI-2005 was significantly associated with reduced relative abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria but increased potentially harmful bacteria in the colonic mucosa of endoscopically normal individuals.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yanhong Liu"", ids = ""47909218""); list(name = ""Nadim J.

Therefore, it generates a flood of data that represents significant challenges for their interpretation. With the technological advances of mass spectrometers that allow the study of proteins in a large-scale, the analysis of complex protein samples becomes possible. The capacity to identify reliably all proteins present in a sample is a requirement to provide the suitable biologically interpretation. Mainly, two basic strategies are used for protein identification: Database searching strategy and De novo sequencing strategy. These two strategies differ in term of their ability and performance to control the false discovery rate (FDR). Here we review the achivements of mass spectrometry-based proteomics. We are shedding light on strategies of peptide/protein identification and the challenge of sensitivity and specificity, as they are the key factor to control the growth of false positive.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Sara El Jadid"", ids = ""88740087""); list(name = ""Raja Touahni"", ids = ""39336442""); list(name = ""Ahmed Moussa"", ids = ""144050363"")",,,,,4

In such tests, the reported p-value for a hypothesis can understate the evidence against the null hypothesis and consequently statistical power may be lost. False Discovery Rate adjustments, used in multiple comparison settings, can worsen the unfavorable effect. We present a computationally efficient and test-agnostic calibration technique that can substantially reduce the conservativeness of such tests. As a consequence, a lower sample size might be sufficient to reject the null hypothesis for true alternatives, and experimental costs can be lowered. We apply the calibration technique to the results of DESeq, a popular method for detecting differentially expressed genes from RNA sequencing data. The increase in power may be particularly high in small sample size experiments, often used in preliminary experiments and funding applications.",2014,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""John P.

11a29884f5699904ca97d44bbef697e0c712eb75,Abnormalities of interhemispheric functional connectivity in individuals with acute eye pain: a resting-state fMRI study.,"AIM
To study the changes of the resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) between acute eye pain (EP) subjects and healthy controls (HCs) in the two hemispheres by using voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) method.


METHODS
Totally 20 patients with EP and 20 HCs were enrolled, sex, age, and education were matched, and all subjects were examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans at resting-state. The changes of rsFC between the hemispheres were evaluated by the VMHC method according to Gaussian random field (GRF) theory. In order to identify the VMHC, as biomarkers for distinguishing EP and from HC, the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) had been analyzed. The relationships were evaluated with Pearson correlation analysis between the mean VMHC signal values and clinical features in these patients.


RESULTS
By comparing with health subjects, the significant decreased VMHC values was observed in lingual/calcarine (Brodmann area, BA 30), precentral/postcentral gyrus (PreCG/PosCG; BA 4) and medial frontal gyrus (MFG; BA 8) (false discovery rate corrected <0.01) in the acute EP individuals. The accuracy of area under curve was excellent indicated by the ROC curve analysis of each brain regions.


CONCLUSION
Our study demonstrates preliminary evidence of disrupted interhemispheric rsFC in acute EP in sensorimotor and limbic system and somatosensory cortex, which might give some useful information for understanding the neurological mechanisms in acute EP individuals.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhi-Zhang Dong"", ids = ""46217707""); list(name = ""Fei-Yin Zhu"", ids = ""108621117""); list(name = ""Wen-Qing Shi"", ids = ""51046194""); list(name = ""Yong-Qiang Shu"", ids = ""51343253""); list(name = ""Laurence Chen"", ids = ""49330225""); list(name = ""Qing Yuan"", ids = ""145102161""); list(name = ""Qi Lin"", ids = ""144467649""); list(name = ""Pei-Wen Zhu"", ids = ""30025071""); list(name = ""Kang-Cheng Liu"", ids = ""5137922""); list(name = ""You-Lan Min"", ids = ""40795100""); list(name = ""Lei Ye"", ids = ""144440702""); list(name = ""Yi Shao"", ids = ""3025744"")",,fd3c5d7788510dde7850738d1283a4bc6068f995; 4ae1d427f4fda1b10b1977dd019fb97220e1e77c; 75d47163cb7a60807204b857ab367328f875441e; 25f0ef48d5594ad60bfff22e6b66afccd4cf2a47; f4e265b7e87cfbc36f350273973ad4ad3c13a891; 892a6f34f11bc2926ed4d7522efd954661392fc5; 674230f9a5049f1042a406e87e7672042cfbd3d3; 780e65da8a7db4a2eda4f53065d4c6ad81255934; 5f6df061e992f82a74ca4669d926936fe71e097a; 22cdbcf635ad4beb83aed9a10a197436756c3a4d; 2c5f52cf986117042b625759f139a3d9f5d070a6; ab2af6db7b6035e71d297ebdd7ff624766166e02; d043c3165d8da6e53e05300ad3b9367b1af9f6af; f4752b9c73ec72791042a2a1b11d2eb93cd7a5e1; 9fd5403583ac074d5c4b91b34069201147e405b9; fc1d568021431e1fd9b4ef2623e5b706f4240239; 5a69e199909f849f6fc2fbc95f38c69aff3dcbef; 419cb85927137ac5fc115a4bb8487f22da298013; 50f230214e313e9b3c51822fe5dca2759af39e78; c39d67a779df76abe9feaf257cd0935e1c87ab50; f588c3d457a4f0fa42ac4c1e4182456c1c101bdc; 735719bc7577761be692f8c98da19cef02400ff1; 3e53681bf7e45a7372ffef0290b1021f4fa2a18f; d7056a87a6f0dcebd8a90e90434af7917202b6fd; bef5ee0ec1319e10e32b7cf7c9c452c512628543; faeeb2c87b59fa4b3993424a25aa03feac55313b; 566052f22f96ad6f628da8246e545730cbc614f6; 8d37b8d389813ef7b933b7eedcf71173232ab2fb; 77d41e1064e9005eb11c0e943ef7a79bd52eb0f6; 315979ca108f37d8cee337aa45ea1e1f3477949c; e126f54081354fb47ac1da7c1c78a58823b630ad; 4dbeabd013dc443b352f8795568e79eca360ff60; cde6800f873c9e92b54fbd09a1d0a6189e808e8b; 58a2ca218822ee3ba7cb9b714254974a39f03605; 173219433ee5a6abb5a87a946d4645b6b36b35eb,International journal of ophthalmology,12 4,"

e0602c5359e059d9395eda68cf5b15cd3df3206d,Multiple hypotheses testing and expected number of type I errors,"The performance of multiple test procedures with respect to error control is an old issue. Assuming that all hypotheses are true we investigate the behavior of the expected number of type I errors (ENE) as a characteristic of certain multiple tests controlling the familywise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery rate (FDR) at a prespecified level. We derive explicit formulas for the distribution of the number of false rejections as well as for the ENE for single-step, step-down and step-up procedures based on independent p-values. Moreover, we determine the corresponding asymptotic distributions of the number of false rejections as well as explicit formulae for the ENE if the number of hypotheses tends to infinity. In case of FWER-control we mostly obtain Poisson distributions and in one case a geometric distribution as limiting distributions; in case of FDR control we obtain limiting distributions which are apparently not named in the literature. Surprisingly, the ENE is bounded by a small number regardless of the number of hypotheses under consideration. Finally, it turns out that in case of dependent test statistics the ENE behaves completely differently compared to the case of independent test statistics.",2002,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Helmut Finner"", ids = ""2839900""); list(name = ""Markus Roters"", ids = ""1945131"")",cbb6ef162bfedde3f75543eb1a4f6ec3fabede4a; a15e1f238fc526b86c50ee0945b17ea2cee8fbdc; c7980dbe0470e041ed17da22250f15fb35f3e73d; 059ff4ea91c577fff7f8de127ea09d8912aa7ef2; 96649977e43190f96866fcaba856a79101c39fac; fe3448c3122217de529abe2f9313c15cd9cc76c7; 50f087a7e8665dab3a87c8bd33e41a5668b6a3d6; 9dd724452ba9fb67f77b1381154ba29730a89e04; e2a187c6ec22b531a438bfa65b679b9a1a87597d; ec427d9bcd31fb4887cf7ba8c8b5360dbf5dfa74; 34382262d4407dbf2781acd514965b22c9350237; e2f64556ad275eb596b3e1ded98424630cc699aa; 6d962648c4c48b1004197d8e93e7fb04bcc64597; 7a0027eadfa6a085bfb55d6f30a9d96d203e8037; 83cc1b61565f9eab9776b1ba72006c1edf0d0348; ac2e7c3e348c24acb09b1ef82e3e1d5811a4e7c7; e17e8caadef5676f8b272214ec0ecd2314db5b91; 6a379e0d8804cfa4514813a6e81b279b730b850e; 6d050671894ce4dbe19aa0573f72ed20bcfbfb8a; ba0d3a10c57f03bf6ac43589413a57a5687f4c0b; 72d999b37470ca58c0e7b025060e32257f667e51; 10ab0830336e3b204202f47aa0fb63a813e3dc71; 15c790cfa8afff058ce02b342ebe20ee7c045750; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 8d98ce43d00dedc463f13702d0c468dafa428686; 8bd639b2578b37b8393a1087132acfd067ab939e; a73932d368f9a4ad68fb558613fd447cba5567b2; ff78265a35edeb990632663c53ff8cc506ecdca9; 4fada95911ff3934b85441ff6960968f8b580881; 24b40db4f49098fdef232d27628d3d20dc658404; 81e2fd87effcb34ba2fca6217e6e25da86015b88; 2e75c71561b29494d2b0cd962a68e0e04afe32c9; aa95eaffacddcc1cde626b25be7739346873a1f6; 1900e254a8923892e0bdd6a0315bb845ceb6bc3e; 1c49766cd3d2e19089fea703e579a73011946ac7; 234cff6937c43cb1c4d3510faeda6c8720737f9d; 0b9930266112c8b0684343f741cf83cf2b9a1da2; 1e2aa927e930e10a98892afeabf7b05ba05df7a7; a438453add52542eae1a6710dfd5e66990376ed4; 9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6; 6799109a1fe8cb1ea77a974072d43527fc759cf3; 8912df65a21a260022775772440797e45df8e6cc; aced86a6933b6259ddc1ef6879231f5d370510a8; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; e079efca326f42b0c97648ec09ea585f520758cc; 67d06fb28ecb659f6035a1b6032685b27b916412; fefcdc7e8f7e40462071761f679eaa051345c3c3; 04f7eb10b37138f3c1a962f8319fb60b690f8632; 703994d9c0de91777ff741b27c9afa227182a7cf; 6470ca07d9fe23f4f364a6584da954417644fb94; 1775719a073b2f510ba5454a69f04aa6051fbff0; 30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98; a9e6e7a93a17f340089859b313d0209d41db9271; 71616c2b98b8d20f9e2261015c5e7874d930bf86; 0725893c81e1ea0131e27ffab61c31900f9bef05; 422adc24881a92ba1d934dc7bc1b686764e6336e,,Annals of Statistics,30,220-238
120fc3ff023e24b8c828fda2ed1ae28abe11583c,A Geneâ€“Environment Interaction Between Smoking and Gene polymorphisms Provides a High Risk of Two Subgroups of Sarcoidosis,"The influence and effect of cigarette smoking in sarcoidosis is unclear. Here, we evaluated gene-environment interaction between multiple genetic variants including HLA genes and smoking in sarcoidosis defined by two clinical phenotypes, LÃ¶fgrenâ€™s syndrome (LS) and patients without LÃ¶fgrenâ€™s syndrome (non-LS). To quantify smoking effects in sarcoidosis, we performed a gene-environment interaction study in a Swedish population-based case-control study consisting of 3,713 individuals. Cases and controls were classified according to their cigarette smoking status and genotypes by Immunochip platform. Gene-smoking interactions were quantified by an additive interaction model using a logistic regression adjusted by sex, ageÂ and first two principal components. The estimated attributable proportion (AP) was used to quantify the interaction effect. Assessment of smoking effects with inclusion of genetic information revealed 53 (in LS) and 34 (in non-LS) SNP-smoking additive interactions at false discovery rate (FDR) below 5%. The lead signals interacting with smoking were rs12132140 (APâ€‰=â€‰0.56, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.22â€“0.90), pâ€‰=â€‰1.28e-03) in FCRL1 for LS and rs61780312 (APâ€‰=â€‰0.62, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.28â€“0.90), pâ€‰=â€‰3e-04) in IL23R for non-LS. We further identified 16 genomic loci (in LS) and 13 (in non-LS)Â that interact with cigarette smoking.

ffb3fd5a17ee75f46d830253bdc5bc2a66712820,Hormonal Risk Factors for Breast Cancer and DNA Methylation,"Epigenetic modifications influence gene expression and have been implicated in the development of breast cancer. Few studies have evaluated breast cancer risk factors in relation to DNA methylation. We examined known reproductive and hormonal risk factors for breast cancer and epigenome-wide methylation patterns. Participants included 612 women enrolled in the Sister Study prospective cohort who did not have breast cancer. DNA methylation profiling was performed using an Illumina array at the NIH Center for Inherited Disease (CIDR) on DNA extracted from whole blood. Methylation data was obtained at single CpG site resolution for 27,578 CpG sites covering >14,000 genes across 23 chromosomes. Statistical analyses were performed using normalized methylation residuals from a linear model adjusting for age and experimental variables. Controlling for a false discovery rate of 5% (q < 0.05), 1,452 methylation sites (1,220 in CpG islands) were differentially methylated in postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal women. Average methylation was increased at 1,040 sites and decreased at 412 sites. Gene ontology (GO) analysis suggested enrichment of several biological pathways including lobular involution. Among parous women, only 2 sites (1 CpG island) were differentially methylated among women with older versus younger ages at first birth. A single CpG site demonstrated lower average methylation values among long-term users of postmenopausal hormones compared to short-term users. No further statistically significant differences in methylation patterns (q < 0.05) were observed according to age at menarche, parity, breastfeeding history, or postmenopausal hormone use. These data support the menopausal transition as an influential period for epigenetic modifications; few associations between DNA methylation and other classical reproductive and hormonal breast cancer risk factors were observed.

However, reproducibility of blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal changes during bladder filling has not been proven yet. Therefore, our aim was to investigate BOLD signal changes in response to bladder filling to provide evidence for repeatability using a standardized filling paradigm, i.e. a magnetic resonance (MR)compatible and MR-synchronized infusion-drainage system. METHODS: 20 right-handed healthy subjects, 10 women and 10 men, mean age 39 years (range 22-54) with no history of urinary urgency and/or urinary incontinence were included. Visit 1: After catheterization and bladder pre-filling with body warm saline until persistent desire to void, we performed in a 3T MR scanner automated, repetitive bladder filling of 100mL body warm saline over 15s, i.e. block design study. Visit 2: Within 8 weeks from visit 1, a second MR scan was performed in the same manner. Using SPM8, BOLD signal changes during bladder filling were compared to rest, i.e. pre-filled condition. For within-group whole-brain (WB) analysis, a voxel-threshold was set at p<0.001 using the false discovery rate (FDR) correction to adjust for multiple comparisons. Differences between both visits were investigated using a paired t test. In addition, regions of interest (ROI) were defined using the Wake Forrest University Pickatlas and included as a mask in order to restrict the voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis (familywise error (FWE)-correction) to pre-specified brain areas. RESULTS: Within-group WB analysis revealed activation in the following brain areas for visit 1: bilateral prefrontal gyrus (PFG); anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), mid and posterior cingulate cortex; left insula; hippocampus; temporal and parietal gyrus; and for visit 2: bilateral PFG; ACC; bilateral insula; bilateral basal ganglia. No statistical differences in BOLD signal changes were detected between both visits. ROI analyses, a more sensitive approach, detected reproducibility of BOLD signal changes in the following areas: PFG, ACC and insula. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that automated, repetitive bladder filling of body warm saline using a MR-compatible and MRsynchronized infusion-drainage system shows reproducible BOLD signal changes in specific areas, known from previous neuroimaging studies to be involved in supraspinal lower urinary tract control.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Matthias Walter"", ids = ""144987372""); list(name = ""Lorenz Leitner"", ids = ""39477208""); list(name = ""Lars Michels"", ids = ""144751177""); list(name = ""Spyros Kollias"", ids = ""145389578""); list(name = ""Patrick Freund"", ids = ""46331057""); list(name = ""Martina D.

In order to obtain proteins responsive to Zn, Mn, or Fe mineral deficiency, we conducted iTRAQ analysis using a microsomal fraction of protein extractions from Arabidopsis root tissues. We identified and quantified 730 common proteins in three biological replicates with less than 1Â % false discovery rate. To determine the role of these proteins in tolerating mineral deficiencies and their relation to each other, we calculated cosine correlation coefficients and represented the outcomes on a correlation map for visual understanding of functional relations among the identified proteins. Functionally similar proteins were gathered into the same clusters. Interestingly, a cluster of proteins (FRO2, IRT1, AHA2, PDR9/ABCG37, and GLP5) highly responsive to Fe deficiency was identified, which included both known and unknown novel proteins involved in tolerating Fe deficiency.

Mechanisms underlying the effects of traffic-related air pollution on people with asthma remain largely unknown, despite the abundance of observational and controlled studies reporting associations between traffic sources and asthma exacerbation and hospitalizations.


OBJECTIVES
To identify molecular pathways perturbed following traffic pollution exposures, we analyzed data as part of the Atlanta Commuters Exposure (ACE-2) study, a crossover panel of commuters with and without asthma.


METHODS
We measured 27 air pollutants and conducted high-resolution metabolomics profiling on blood samples from 45 commuters before and after each exposure session. We evaluated metabolite and metabolic pathway perturbations using an untargeted metabolome-wide association study framework with pathway analyses and chemical annotation.


RESULTS
Most of the measured pollutants were elevated in highway commutes (pâ€¯<â€¯0.05). From both negative and positive ionization modes, 17,586 and 9087 metabolic features were extracted from plasma, respectively. 494 and 220 unique features were associated with at least 3 of the 27 exposures, respectively (pâ€¯<â€¯0.05), after controlling confounders and false discovery rates. Pathway analysis indicated alteration of several inflammatory and oxidative stress related metabolic pathways, including leukotriene, vitamin E, cytochrome P450, and tryptophan metabolism. We identified and annotated 45 unique metabolites enriched in these pathways, including arginine, histidine, and methionine. Most of these metabolites were not only associated with multiple pollutants, but also differentially expressed between participants with and without asthma. The analysis indicated that these metabolites collectively participated in an interrelated molecular network centering on arginine metabolism, underlying the impact of traffic-related pollutants on individuals with asthma.


CONCLUSIONS
We detected numerous significant metabolic perturbations associated with in-vehicle exposures during commuting and validated metabolites that were closely linked to several inflammatory and redox pathways, elucidating the potential molecular mechanisms of traffic-related air pollution toxicity. These results support future studies of metabolic markers of traffic exposures and the corresponding molecular mechanisms.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Donghai Liang"", ids = ""4196967""); list(name = ""Chandresh Nanji Ladva"", ids = ""22622611""); list(name = ""Rachel Golan"", ids = ""38079742""); list(name = ""Tianwei Yu"", ids = ""48881100""); list(name = ""Douglas I.

9786557215c18594e0f9ca1c5a6e4368c49b58f1,Serum prognostic markers in head and neck cancer.,"PURPOSE
Recognized prognostic factors do not adequately predict outcomes of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients after their initial treatment. We identified from the literature nine potential serum prognostic markers and assessed whether they improve outcome prediction.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
A pretreatment serum sample was obtained from 527 of the 540 HNC patients who participated in a randomized controlled trial. During follow-up, 115 had a HNC recurrence, 110 had a second primary cancer (SPC), and 216 died. We measured nine potential serum prognostic markers: prolactin, soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor, IL-6, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, free beta-human choriogonadotropin, insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, and soluble epidermal growth factor receptor. Cox regression was used to identify a reference predictive model for (a) HNC recurrence, (b) SPC incidence, and (c) overall mortality. Each serum marker was added in turn to these reference models to determine by the likelihood ratio test whether it significantly improved outcome prediction. We controlled for the false discovery rate that results from multiple testing.


RESULTS
IL-6 was the only serum marker that significantly improved outcome prediction. Higher levels of IL-6 were associated with a higher SPC incidence. The hazard ratio comparing the uppermost quartile to the lowest quartile of IL-6 was 2.68 (95% confidence interval, 1.49-4.08). IL-6 was also associated with SPC-specific mortality but not with mortality due to other causes. No marker improved outcome prediction for cancer recurrence or overall mortality.


CONCLUSIONS
IL-6 significantly improves outcome prediction for SPC in HNC patients.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""FranÃ§ois Meyer"", ids = ""144730481""); list(name = ""Elodie Samson"", ids = ""40422764""); list(name = ""Pierre Douville"", ids = ""3014260""); list(name = ""Thierry Duchesne"", ids = ""144459337""); list(name = ""Geoffrey Liu"", ids = ""48573578""); list(name = ""Isabelle Bairati"", ids = ""6394607"")",29d248ec64676215b42debf1472f9d0c2a062c2c; 8cc6144c69f70b39400563776424af5bb8949363; a8bc65e667b136224a4aa690916087cd86f6b3aa; 80057f62723ca07d805a64df9173483fa7307568; 409ad039330fbf0b0cd4c13460afbe0bffa4676f; babf9691a1d759e3b8e8758802bf26603fa7df35; eebd93acb27becc5b68bf966ff8da92c4462fbe0; d0807dafb4c30abab55245a67f9156ce9f1d88c7; fb15941b09124ef7570c9ebdde622eb6882eb697; 98064b344ef60d450c66abc981b478fa8ee4e0f5; a435f33f04d8bb4fa5e6737f3ec4a54e26c31faf; 29c953e51475ae991412268a918666e886de0334; e960db8b00f89cde063f63f1c44696f730c044b0; c7fdce8760d2cc99897226f3d2524337c3309bd6; 012d2789c7055d3a9df86dab7defe319bdeddd0b; a2ce5b2e6544ce7a4045b3272ac9e031329a4106; 0f3026cd3c594282d59b5a13bb4f84355035dde2; 64bd47be6735967cd647cb4b4d5a76d5e7308349; 37dab2473020dab842b211fbe35a7d6304f10137; 50a8af4dcc44ae0fc8d9710af5f686a21203f40e; dda9c34037c0871f971c5b44e5970e01b7797591; 741e80ffbf5337905b16b68d10c08b0736062be6; ca4aacfcb63915bdeef15e39e87c496d6bc13165; 6bac527a05670f4874882c7405cebdc8a0657e29; 619fef6c7a0794c84aa92eb738197a07ba82844e; 1aba9fb2fa4fc12109291e034112038a7b147620; 55cc64fcbbbe486c1a8a0812a0a821eeb395ec1a; 9656af562167f86a64fb7ad5a10b12893eaf3d11; 290852693e20461977ab4968b34be1efad8d448c; d5a5fca993f0bf2942c3c17f1fef6df6326816a3; 3a0d1db96e984eb800ad77e8fb164a45a2bcc7ff; 28b38a8ca08a2ed7c082317e692bf9b7394ce759; 04d9a379d4cd5857ee38bd057282f5a6bb8c134e; 3c1b1bda4737321c6f6798d295d22facefbce51f; 27a6a712189f15ab06546be22549feedf84035f3; a386604ebcccca16c59f0979b9b35bc068311005,9b2ba538d80ff6451848f4deb3de1952b03c478c; a399d042348d5332ebac6a6b95d31ce3af71cb3f; 879863829771f051e12ec89473575d14894c8686; 03da7304012445d65178f1a93c969d2b09561401; d66dc1220dbdd425ee10314ff781942b092252c8; c5455611b8a5f79cd4f648a8af6d1ad645488da5; d0977089d7b31b3535ceb518faf9da81bd2550ee; 71b28cff3a186c0b697d1125355fe980f8339b8f; bc1bf773c8939121c9679e11928640c58fa20526; d6570de91aad13c95d3001d5ba200a3caf85cedc; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 064e2397864928a6375896b8e027c7c1c3f85dc6; 7e87a6bd696855c790a8b523bc6600b93db846a1; ca251923a0b16848df92d75763351f6f64090afb; 26b736e062bdd00320085e2e81fe3815f6cd224b; 714a49f547ec4751bb5b47f72740851bf1229333; 5400704c817c6afd4b3b08daa961174c3e8cff9a; b94001bda0a707ad0ac43af5cbe9d31eb7276a22; 3e1878c7da69b5b08801b4bbe18bd2c8a3ee8902; 69cdad85c8e24f58564a58775775e8420486301b; 3c6a639a16759bb359ca58484576a5a71b51b932; 3470e74adf14a5a18028d5d3a007abd55781b98f; d6fa7fc2b2feb60621f327f75d71c4846b8b0c27; d096c8441d54d4a64c7fbb277c1cb5b41567f244; 7cd050172c8c1c72acf9bfc435cdaa72509f80e8; a84337ee8edcf540301bb6dd2abeb779c48f8ffd; a7e23f416065a0fb1ae7729f3508e957dbcd0b44; d8a1ce64d721690c41f70b25ff36e79747890ed6; 5d48cf6ddb3b523cdbc172c5dd8b47858be323b4; c961e5dcfe4d165217b9a740e8def67afd06b372; d3359a175587737b7501e876e51721f07f3fb29a; 9d44b115da084ac735294a9384636b74b50def7c; 6ba82b6f7d5013681e479e0c949e32298f258ea9; 46ad18ca3f4e8d0de437a96930b3447295e495b7; 19e35d820dee5bc3bad7b50af43692bf66cda943; c8c02092b49841cf0954c9501ec0f8d393302224; 785e44f8de66133dd3cb2f9c8f78532c826031bf; 119c952ec8494599ad1ab045a16f304791d83e41,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,16 3,"

Measurements of tree diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height (TH) were performed for a set of plots located within a pure and unevenly aged stand of A. chilensis with moderate cover. Normalized difference vegetation indices (NDIs) related to DBH and TH were constructed from the corresponding hyperspectral data in Hyperion imagery. NDIs construction utilized the original spectral reflectance curve, its first derivative, and the continuum-removed reflectance in a two-step procedure that ranks NDIs based on their Spearman correlation with the response variable while controlling the false discovery rate. Several reflectance-based NDIs as well as a larger group of derivative-based NDIs were significantly related to DBH or TH ( Ï Â >Â 0.70). The NDIs most strongly related to the field variables were based on derivative bands located within the same spectral regions used by the broadband greenness index known as green normalized difference vegetation index. Most other significant NDIs used NIR bands, which are well-known for their sensitivity to foliage amount changes. The results obtained in this exploratory study mostly agreed with the spectral regions expected to be most sensitive to changes in the canopy structure of vegetation. Further research in other A. chilensis forests subject to different site and environmental conditions is needed in order to assess the applicability of the NDIs over a wider range of this endemic species.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Marco A.

Multiple hypothe ses testing approaches can be used to extract a list of com ponents of the data that are likely to be contaminated by a source while controlling a global error criterion. However most of efficients methods available in the literature are de rived for independent tests. Based on the work of Benjamini and Yekutieli [1], we show that under some classical positivity assumptions, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for False Discovery Rate (FDR) control can be directly applied to the result produced by a very common tool in signal and image processing: the matched filter. This shows that despite the de pendency structure between the components of the matched filter output, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure still guaran tee the FDR control.

To identify differentially expressed microRNA (miRNA) in muscle biopsies (MBx) from 15 untreated children with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) compared with 5 controls. Methods. Following MBx miRNA profiling, differentially expressed miRNA and their protein targets were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunological assay. The association of miRNA-10a and miRNA-10b with clinical data was evaluated, including Disease Activity Score (DAS), von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag), nailfold capillary end row loops, duration of untreated disease, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±-308A allele. Results. In JDM, 16/362 miRNA were significantly differentially expressed [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05]. Among these, miRNA-10a was the most downregulated miRNA in both FDR and ranking of fold change: miRNA-10a = â€“2.27-fold, miRNA-10b = â€“1.80-fold. Decreased miRNA-10a and miRNA-10b expressions were confirmed using qRT-PCR: â€“4.16 and â€“2.59 fold, respectively. The qRT-PCR documented that decreased miRNA-10a expression was related to increased vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 in 13 of these JDM cases (correlation â€“0.67, p = 0.012), unlike miRNA-10b data (not significant). Concurrent JDM plasma contained increased levels of interleukin (IL) 6 (p = 0.0363), IL-8 (p = 0.0005), TNF-Î± (p = 0.0011), and monocyte chemoattractant proteins 1 (p = 0.0139). Decreased miRNA-10a, but not miRNA-10b, was associated with the TNF-Î±-308A allele (p = 0.015). In the 15 JDM, a trend of association of miRNA-10a (but not miRNA-10b) with vWF:Ag and DAS was observed. Conclusion. MiRNA-10a downregulation is an important element in untreated JDM muscle pathophysiology. We speculate that muscle miRNA expression in adult dermatomyositis differs from muscle miRNA expression in untreated childhood JDM.

Although juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is a rare disease, it is the most common pediatric inflammatory myopathy with an incidence rate in the United States of about 3.2 children per million per year1,2. This systemic vasculopathy is characJournal of Rheumatology The on December 5, 2015 Published by www.jrheum.org Downloaded from terized by a classic heliotrope rash, Gottron papules, sym metrical proximal muscle weakness, elevated serum levels of muscle-derived enzymes, and evidence of a myopathic process on electromyogram3,4. The â€œgold standardâ€ of diagnosis is the muscle biopsy (MBx) in which perifascicular muscle fiber atrophy is associated with progressive capillary occlusion and an inflammatory infiltrate composed primarily of mononuclear cells5,6. The children manifest muscle and skin involvement, which are evaluated reliably by the Disease Activity Scores (DAS)7,8. Prolonged inflammation results in loss of nailfold capillary end row loops (ERL)9 and the development of dystrophic calcifications in 10% to 35% of children10. Several inflammatory and cell death pathways involving nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB)11,12 and apoptosis13 are documented in juvenile myositis tissue damage, and Type 1 interferons have been implicated as major factors contrib uting to the inflammatory process14,15. Increased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±16 and Type 1 interferon activity17 have been confirmed in JDM sera. Older patients who had JDM in childhood are at risk for considerable damage to their cardiovascular system, as are adults with dermatomyositis (DM)18,19. However, an investigation of the involvement of microRNA (miRNA) in the pathophysiology of JDM muscle involvement has not been previously reported, to our knowledge. MiRNA are short, noncoding RNA that inhibit miRNA by binding to complementary sequences on target miRNA, resulting in translational repression or degradation and gene silencing20, and have a complex role in striated muscle21. One miRNA can regulate multiple target miRNA21 and altered miRNA expression has been identified in a wide spectrum of human illnesses, including autoimmune diseases22, cancer23, and cardiovascular diseases24. Several miRNA (e.g., miRNA-155, -146a, -146b, -203, -214, -1, -133, and -206) have been implicated in primary muscular disorders in adults, including DM and polymyositis (PM)25,26. The purpose of our study was to assess miRNA expression in muscle from untreated children with active symptoms of definite/probable JDM compared with healthy orthopedic controls, and to determine the association of these regulatory factors with the childrenâ€™s clinical status. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient population. Under magnetic resonance imaging guidance, a diagnostic MBx was performed of the involved area in untreated children with definite/probable JDM (Bohan and Peter criteria)3,4. Prior to biopsy, age-appropriate JDM-informed consent (IRB# 2008-13457) was obtained and at surgery, small samples of muscle and plasma were collected for research. The patient population consisted of 9 girls and 6 boys for the miRNA profiling and validation, with a mean age of 6.2 Â± 3.1 years and the following racial distribution: white 80%, non-white 20%. Five healthy orthopedic controls (2 girls, 3 boys) who were white, mean age 12.3 Â± 4.2 years, donated both muscle and plasma (IRB# 2001-11715). In this control group, 2 had scoliosis, 1 had an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, 1 underwent an osteochondroma excision, and the last control had an adductor myotomy. DAS. The DAS of both skin involvement (DAS SK) and muscle weakness (DAS WK) were assessed by 1 physician (LMP) at the time that the plasma and MBx were obtained. Scores ranged from 0â€“9 for DAS SK and 0â€“11 for DAS WK; scores greater than 0 were considered abnormal7. Duration of untreated disease (DUD). Eight children with JDM had disease duration of < 3 months with a mean of 1.69 Â± 0.76 months, while 7 children had JDM disease duration â‰¥ 3 months with a mean of 11.82 Â± 10.08 months; they were classified, respectively, as having untreated disease of short and long durations. Determination of TNF-Î± alleles at -308. The primers and probe used for detection of alleles were synthesized at the Northwestern University Biotechnical Facility (Chicago, Illinois, USA). Anticoagulated whole blood was collected in EDTA, and then aliquoted and stored at â€“70Â°C until DNA isolation was performed. DNA was isolated with the use of a Qiagen DNA isolation kit (Valencia). TNF-Î± alleles were identified with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), as reported16. Measurement of the ERL number. All children underwent nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC) at the time of diagnosis, consisting of freeze-frame digital microscopy images of each of the 8 fingers, excluding the thumbs. NFC images were obtained using a Leica Z6APO Stereomicroscope, on which was mounted a Leica DFC295 Digital Microscope Camera. The images were analyzed as described. A mean number of ERL of < 7.00/mm was considered abnormal, as reported9. von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag) laboratory testing. Standard determination of the vWF:Ag was obtained at diagnosis when children with JDM visited the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Chicago.

2a412e008efceac3f43fe18837d38e633d528fbb,"Associations between chemosensory function, sweet taste preference, and the previous nightâ€™s sleep in non-obese males","Abstract There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that sleep influences chemosensory perception. Males and females differ in neural responses to chemosensory function as well as average sleep duration, suggesting the possibility of sex differences regarding relationships between sleep and chemosensory perception. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to characterize relationships between sleep and chemosensory function in males. Secondary analyses compared responses to females from an earlier study. A total of 51 non-obese (BMIâ€¯ 2 ) male participants completed testing. Sleep was measured using a single-channel (A 1 â€“A 2 ) electroencephalogram (Zmachine) and next day sensory function, including sweet taste threshold, preferred sweet taste concentration, olfactory threshold, olfactory identification ability, and odor pleasantness ratings, were evaluated. After correction for false discovery rate (FDR), preferred sweet taste concentration was negatively associated with total sleep time (TST) (Pâ€¯=â€¯0.0444), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (Pâ€¯=â€¯0.0060), and the sum of REM and SWS (Pâ€¯=â€¯0.0060). Odor identification ability was positively associated with TST (Pâ€¯=â€¯0.0187) and REM sleep duration (Pâ€¯=â€¯0.0424), but these findings did not survive FDR correction (Pâ€¯>â€¯0.05). Participants grouped into shorter sleep groups and low REMâ€¯+â€¯SWS preferred significantly greater sucrose concentrations than those in longer and high REMâ€¯+â€¯SWS groups (Pâ€¯=â€¯0.0420, 0.0039, respectively). Multiple regression analysis indicated that REM alone was the best predictor of sweet taste preference, and that TST alone was the best predictor of odor identification score. While the best predictors for preferred sweet taste concentration differed between males and females, no differences in preferred sucrose concentration were observed.",2019,Psychology,"list(name = ""Edward J Szczygiel"", ids = ""12015032""); list(name = ""SungEun Cho"", ids = ""34360955""); list(name = ""Margaret K.

Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a compound derived from diet and metabolism by the gut microbiome, has been associated with several chronic diseases, although the mechanisms of action are not well understood and few human studies have investigated microbes involved in its production.


OBJECTIVES
Our study aims were 1) to investigate associations of TMAO and its precursors (choline, carnitine, and betaine) with inflammatory and cardiometabolic risk biomarkers; and 2) to identify fecal microbiome profiles associated with TMAO.


METHODS
We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data collected from 1653 participants (826 men and 827 women, aged 60-77 y) in the Multiethnic Cohort Study. Plasma concentrations of TMAO and its precursors were measured by LC-tandem MS. We also analyzed fasting blood for markers of inflammation, glucose and insulin, cholesterol, and triglycerides (TGs), and further measured blood pressure. Fecal microbiome composition was evaluated by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene V1-V3 region. Associations of TMAO and its precursors with disease risk biomarkers were assessed by multivariable linear regression, whereas associations between TMAO and the fecal microbiome were assessed by permutational multivariate ANOVA and hurdle regression models using the negative binomial distribution.


RESULTS
Median (IQR) concentration of plasma TMAO was 3.05 Î¼mol/L (2.10-4.60 Î¼mol/L). Higher concentrations of TMAO and carnitine, and lower concentrations of betaine, were associated with greater insulin resistance (all PÂ <Â 0.02). Choline was associated with higher systolic blood pressure, TGs, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, and lower HDL cholesterol (P ranging from <0.001 to 0.03), reflecting an adverse cardiometabolic risk profile. TMAO was associated with abundance of 13 genera (false discovery rateÂ <Â 0.05), including Prevotella, Mitsuokella, Fusobacterium, Desulfovibrio, and bacteria belonging to the families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, as well as the methanogen Methanobrevibacter smithii.


CONCLUSIONS
Plasma TMAO concentrations were associated with a number of trimethylamine-producing bacterial taxa, and, along with its precursors, may contribute to inflammatory and cardiometabolic risk pathways.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Benjamin C.

b8c9bbd3781d8fc14e9024561c3a32fcb7197a1a,On the Selection of Common Factors for Macroeconomic Forecasting,"We address the problem of selecting the common factors that are relevant for forecasting macroeconomic variables. In economic forecasting using diffusion indexes the factors are ordered, according to their importance, in terms of relative variability, and are the same for each variable to predict, i.e. the process of selecting the factors is not supervised by the predictand. We propose a simple and operational supervised method, based on selecting the factors on the basis of their significance in the regression of the predictand on the predictors. Given a potentially large number of predictors, we consider linear transformations obtained by principal components analysis. The orthogonality of the components implies that the standard t-statistics for the inclusion of a particular component are independent, and thus applying a selection procedure that takes into account the multiplicity of the hypotheses tests is both correct and computationally feasible. We focus on three main multiple testing procedures: Holmâ€™s sequential method, controlling the family wise error rate, the Benjamini-Hochberg method, controlling the false discovery rate, and a procedure for incorporating prior information on the ordering of the components, based on weighting the p-values according to the eigenvalues associated to the components. We compare the empirical performances of these methods with the classical diffusion index (DI) approach proposed by Stock and Watson, conducting a pseudo-real time forecasting exercise, assessing the predictions of 8 macroeconomic variables using factors extracted from an U.S. dataset consisting of 121 quarterly time series. The overall conclusion is that nature is tricky, but essentially benign: the information that is relevant for prediction is effectively condensed by the first few factors. However, variable selection, leading to exclude some of the low order principal components, can lead to a sizable improvement in forecasting in specific cases. Only in one instance, real personal income, we were able to detect a significant contribution from high order components.",2014,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Alessandro Giovannelli"", ids = ""10380997""); list(name = ""Tommaso Proietti"", ids = ""143872532"")",13092527d951e2c78dc6010e25fb333919561e6a; 3d85bf91b988ad8a031d987dd6d04c817f0ce538; 99c842081a3a5292b55cb88385e008fea50be997; 472a3a0212db3596b728dd1ad688abd61f3ce4c7; bc095bd8af0f9b43dbcd562142cd8af5ae27cc54; ba73175f0f13a99d4f02e13d55fd31f664897081; 9d83362c934c79eda3e3e9f9fd9386c0e6cb45be; d1fb8191031d34719a8043c39c9eb9216f3c6dd3; eedbb03964c298cebd2a7dc1879f63845d62421a,9a42098359624a4a62da7103a49e3ace2bcd1249; 2b2237b8b0423b3598b67664776a1388041ea7db; 8dbc78c1ff1742643f32c9b4d37e64b494fb719a; eeca494ed4f29143b8c342fe4b939e6a77936d42; 1321b86c5d5a41fe76302f8d8b711ffc1ae26747; efb2a2d6dfc543812feaa0aa9271cfd9786d0758; 550b1b5ecfddbd279e8728afbebb69643b5a75f9; fd5de690155d2ba8397906fe0e0d0d2e42ef5897; 5c7416638acf9836d0bd2dbb5c269c8e07604ad4; a1dbd528ce5b07c6a1c6983c6ac80df090cd295a; 9894ed9db33896e1042f2c5b67070d5c0d435931; 016eb4fce870dd335084478a4caf2ab74ee12ea2; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; 982251f241013f152554fccb442cf26e0ce30a5f; 6f7c4b5dba6e92339fae4c92ceb81d93c191b4bc; a0d3e6306b7d1186c4500eac326f2346005e8c00; 24004054849917b5d827f97a518c7a537f8e87a9; 1d189a836b92b4fd21bd201c0c75fba70ddedd0f; 00333292b40bcf7ad601f71e94fe1c4f4b537208; 8c362d0fd11e593bd27bd5b655c9cc04969a753f; 8a5c806ec6365d330df785a5609ef3df63a837c0; 5914bdd10e1b5edc48b23eb603b385565df8f9cb; 7d1c32f49ffcaef488d655151e011056908a37e7; 61884448f38c9047267dce42f14d18c161710cdd; eeeefbdd339a5dcb7a1a901192d86e98d7d9b436; 1cd88161e6f36704c2a75f5656fcf9527d931de0; bee570503aaa0ed5bc5dd4cf6aa742df0b5cef87; c8fa97b05ee9b577d6456ebbfc0f9f103c03509d; 8dea6ebc06a57dfc461dd8aea36c5a00c8dedcf0; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 9879a6bf27d16757509dcee26cf12f6d995083c1; 4b1ef85b1bad9cf560a08f6f7f5b294bebc180df; 9f77de4b2c6b77bd2ae29c63f9b0e2b002b1c728; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412,,35,
1db020274f29dd2d716a6a382cd119ece1ff33d9,False Discovery Rates to Detect Signals from Incomplete Spatially Aggregated Data.,"There are a number of ways to test for the absence/presence of a spatial signal in a completely observed fine-resolution image. One of these is a powerful nonparametric procedure called Enhanced False Discovery Rate (EFDR). A drawback of EFDR is that it requires the data to be defined on regular pixels in a rectangular spatial domain. Here, we develop an EFDR procedure for possibly incomplete data defined on irregular small areas. Motivated by statistical learning, we use conditional simulation (CS) to condition on the available data and simulate the full rectangular image at its finest resolution many times (M, say). EFDR is then applied to each of these simulations resulting in M estimates of the signal and M statistically dependent p-values. Averaging over these estimates yields a single, combined estimate of a possible signal, but inference is needed to determine whether there really is a signal present.

Although there is some evidence from animal models and case-control studies of a role for DNA methylation, evidence from human population-based studies is limited. In two cohorts (mothers from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, ALSPAC, nâ€‰=â€‰780 and women from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development, NSHD, nâ€‰=â€‰552), we assessed the association of seven adverse childhood experiences (ACEs: parental physical illness, parental mental illness, parental death, parental separation, suboptimal maternal bonding, childhood illness and child maltreatment) as well as their combination (ACE score) with genome-wide DNA methylation levels measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in peripheral blood at mean age 47 years (ALSPAC) and in buccal cells at age 53 years (NSHD). CpG sites with a genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR) below 0.05 and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with one-step Å idÃ¡k correction p-values below 0.05 in each cohort were examined in the other cohort. No individual CpG sites replicated across cohorts. However, nine DMRs replicated across cohorts respectively associated with the ACE score (one region), parental mental illness (two regions), parental physical illness (three regions) and parental death (three regions). These observations indicate that some adverse childhood experiences, notably those related to parental health, may leave imprints on peripheral DNA methylation that persist to mid-life.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lotte C Houtepen"", ids = ""143634849""); list(name = ""Rebecca Hardy"", ids = ""48800298""); list(name = ""Jane Maddock"", ids = ""10026402""); list(name = ""Diana Kuh"", ids = ""145031183""); list(name = ""Enye Linus Anderson"", ids = ""52195114""); list(name = ""C L Relton"", ids = ""152697618""); list(name = ""M.

de43b365b7b12763ba758059ff750e85850bcaea,Immunogenomic landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma with immune cell stroma and EBV-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS
The immunogenomic characteristics of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) with immune cell stroma (HCC-IS), defined histologically, have not been clarified. We investigated the clinical and molecular features of HCC-IS and the prognostic impact of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.


METHODS
We evaluated 219 patients with conventional HCC (C-HCC) and 47 with HCC-IS using in situ hybridization for EBV, immunohistochemistry, multiplex immunofluorescence staining, and whole exome and transcriptome sequencing. Human leukocyte antigen types were also extracted from the sequencing data. Genomic and prognostic parameters were compared between HCC-IS and C-HCC.


RESULTS
CD8 T cell infiltration was more frequent in HCC-IS than C-HCC (mean fraction/sample, 22.6% vs. 8.9%, false discovery rate qâ€¯<0.001), as was EBV positivity in CD20-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (74.5% vs. 4.6%, pâ€¯<0.001). CTNNB1 mutations were not identified in any HCC-IS, while they were present in 24.1% of C-HCC (pâ€¯=â€¯0.016). Inhibitory and stimulatory immune modulators were expressed at similar levels in HCC-IS and EBV-positive C-HCC. Global hypermethylation, and expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in TILs, and PD-L1 in tumors, were also associated with HCC-IS (pâ€¯<0.001), whereas human leukocyte antigen type did not differ according to HCC type or EBV positivity. HCC-IS was an independent factor for favorable recurrence-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.23; pâ€¯=â€¯0.002). However, a subgroup of tumors with a high density of EBV-positive TILs had poorer recurrence-free (aHR 25.48; pâ€¯<0.001) and overall (aHR 9.6; pâ€¯=â€¯0.003) survival, and significant enrichment of CD8 T cell exhaustion signatures (qâ€¯=â€¯0.0296).


CONCLUSIONS
HCC-IS is a distinct HCC subtype associated with a good prognosis and frequent EBV-positive TILs. However, paradoxically, a high density of EBV-positive TILs in tumors is associated with inferior prognostic outcomes. Patients with HCC-IS could be candidates for immunotherapy.


LAY SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinomas with histologic evidence of abundant immune cell infiltration are characterized by frequent activation of Epstein-Barr virus in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and less aggressive clinical behavior. However, a high density of Epstein-Barr virus-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is associated with inferior prognostic outcomes, possibly as a result of immune escape due to significant CD8 T cell exhaustion.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hyo Jeong Kang"", ids = ""89666363""); list(name = ""Ji-hye Oh"", ids = ""46299803""); list(name = ""Sung-min Chun"", ids = ""48967032""); list(name = ""Deokhoon Kim"", ids = ""2962669""); list(name = ""Yeon-mi Ryu"", ids = ""73961621""); list(name = ""Hee Sang Hwang"", ids = ""90709976""); list(name = ""Sang-Yeob Kim"", ids = ""4670107""); list(name = ""Jihyun An"", ids = ""5651467""); list(name = ""Eun Jeong Cho"", ids = ""90281889""); list(name = ""Hyeonjin Lee"", ids = ""48412154""); list(name = ""Ju Hyun Shim"", ids = ""2124956""); list(name = ""Chang Ohk Sung"", ids = ""37272780""); list(name = ""Eunsil Yu"", ids = ""144810641"")",b811c71d423496322c9d3078ad52fadd44db2ef9,,Journal of hepatology,71 1,"

3e6f1f038e00e8b4514ea3a4bb8e74bb2a6cde30,Changes in gene expression induced by chemoradiation in advanced cervical carcinoma: a microarray study of RTOG C-0128.,"PURPOSE
To evaluate gene expression patterns in patients with advanced cervix cancer before and during chemoradiation in a multi-institutional cooperative group setting.


METHODS
RTOG C0128 was designed as a Phase II trial of radiation therapy with concomitant chemotherapy and Celecoxib at 400 mg twice daily for one year. Tumor samples were obtained for microarray gene expression analysis before treatment and at the time of the first implant (paired sample). RNA was extracted, linearly amplified, and purity was assessed by gel electrophoresis. Each sample was hybridized against a universal RNA mixture on a customized spotted array consisting of >10,000 genes. Gene expression pre-treatment was compared with clinical characteristics. Changes in gene expression following radiation were assessed within the paired samples (same patient) and then compared across all paired samples. Data were normalized using the AROMA software, and clustering analysis was performed using Ward's method in Spotfire. Differences in paired samples were calculated with Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM).


RESULTS
From August 2001 to March 2004, 84 patients were accrued to the trial. Tissue was obtained prior to initiation of therapy from 34 patients (40%). FIGO stages of the patients providing tissue were IB (23%), II (57%), and IIIA-IVA (20%). RNA quality was sufficient in 22 pre-treatment and 14 post-treatment samples. Among pre-treatment samples, no significant differences in gene expression were observed by FIGO stage, age, or race. However, between comparison of histologic subtypes (adenocarcinoma, n=5; squamous cell carcinoma, n=17) demonstrated 45 genes differentially expressed with a false discovery rate of 0.018. Cluster analysis segregated unpaired samples into 2 groups: 18/22 comprising pre-treatment samples and 10/14 in group 2 representing post-treatment samples. In all 13 paired samples, gene expression after chemoradiation was significantly upregulated in 91 genes and downregulated in 251 genes (false discovery rate of 0.0018). Genes significantly upregulated included bax, cdk inhibitor 1, MMP2, and adhesion molecules PECAM1, VCAM1, and ICAM2. Genes significantly downregulated included topoisomerase II alpha, myc, H2AX, MSH2, RAD51, RAD53, PCNA, and cell cycle-regulating molecules chk1, CDK2, cyclinB1, cyclin D3, cdc2, and cdc25.


CONCLUSIONS
Microarray analysis was successfully performed in a multi-institutional cooperative group trial. Gene expression significantly correlated with histology, but not stage, age or race. Cluster analysis identified two groups of gene expression profiles correlating with pre or post-treatment acquisition of tissue. Notably, paired samples showed significant changes in gene expression following chemoradiation, including several downregulated radiation response genes. Further analysis comparing gene expression to clinical outcomes, acute and late toxicities awaits maturation of clinical data. Hopefully, this data will lead to the development of molecularly based therapies.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Karen A.

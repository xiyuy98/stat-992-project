Two open-label studies suggested abatacept (ABA) may have a beneficial effect on disease activity and had an acceptable safety profile in pSS.1,2 Objectives To examine the efficacy and safety of ABA vs placebo (PBO) in patients (pts) with moderate-to-severe pSS. Methods In this Phase III, double-blind, PBO-controlled study (NCT02915159), adult pts meeting the 2016 ACR-EULAR criteria for pSS with EULAR Sjogrenâ€™s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) â‰¥5 were randomised to receive ABA 125 mg SC weekly or PBO for 168 days (24 weeks), followed by a 197-day (365-day in Japan) open-label period of ABA treatment. All pts had a 168-day post-treatment follow-up period. Randomisation was stratified by corticosteroid (CS) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) use, enrolment in Japan (yes/no) and stimulated whole salivary flow (SWSF; Results A total of 187 (ABA, 92; PBO, 95) pts were randomised and received â‰¥1 dose of study drug. Baseline characteristics were comparable between treatment groups: mean (SD) age was 52 (12.9) years, 95% of pts were female, 64% were white, 40% were receiving concomitant stable-dose HCQ and 25% oral CS (â‰¤10 mg/day prednisone equivalent). Mean (SD) baseline ESSDAI score was 9.4 (4.3) (ABA, 8.7 [3.4] vs PBO, 10.1 [5.0]). At Day 169, no significant differences were seen between ABA- and PBO-treated pts for the primary or key secondary efficacy outcomes (Table 1). Applying the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg method (with a false discovery rate of 5%) at Day 169, significant treatment differences were observed for 5/12 biomarkers (post hoc analysis) (Table 1). Serious AEs related to the study drug occurred in 3% of ABA- and 1% of PBO-treated pts. Related AEs occurred in 46% and 25% of ABA- and PBO-treated pts, respectively, but this was not enriched for any specific event and there were no new ABA safety signals. Conclusion Despite favourably impacting biomarkers of disease activity, abatacept therapy was no better than PBO for improving the clinical measures of disease. These results do not indicate a clinical benefit of abatacept in pSS. References [1] Meiners PM, et al. Ann Rheum Dis2014;73:1393â€“6. [2] Adler S, et al.

2aa5df22b25edfdf938c11177b36038c825bf391,A New Approach for Large Scale Multiple Testing with Application to FDR Control for Graphically Structured Hypotheses,"In many large scale multiple testing applications, the hypotheses often have a known graphical structure, such as gene ontology in gene expression data. Exploiting this graphical structure in multiple testing procedures can improve power as well as aid in interpretation. However, incorporating the structure into large scale testing procedures and proving that an error rate, such as the false discovery rate (FDR), is controlled can be challenging. In this paper, we introduce a new general approach for large scale multiple testing, which can aid in developing new procedures under various settings with proven control of desired error rates. This approach is particularly useful for developing FDR controlling procedures, which is simplified as the problem of developing per-family error rate (PFER) controlling procedures. Specifically, for testing hypotheses with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure, by using the general approach, under the assumption of independence, we first develop a specific PFER controlling procedure and based on this procedure, then develop a new FDR controlling procedure, which can preserve the desired DAG structure among the rejected hypotheses. Through a small simulation study and a real data analysis, we illustrate nice performance of the proposed FDR controlling procedure for DAG-structured hypotheses.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Wenge Guo"", ids = ""47032935""); list(name = ""Gavin Lynch"", ids = ""144568652""); list(name = ""Joseph P.

ffce38966b7dbb982474bc8827a7ebca219e70d4,False Discovery Rate for Homology Searches,"While many different aspects of retrieval algorithms (e.g., BLAST) have been studied in depth, the method for determining the retrieval threshold has not enjoyed the same attention. Furthermore, with genetic databases growing rapidly, the challenges of multiple testing are escalating. In order to improve search sensitivity, we propose the use of the false discovery rate (FDR) as the method to control the number of irrelevant (""false positive"") sequences. In this paper, we introduce BLAST FDR , an extended version of BLAST that uses a FDR method for the threshold criterion. We evaluated five different multiple testing methods on a large training database and chose the best performing one, Benjamini-Hochberg, as the default for BLAST FDR . BLAST FDR achieves 14.1% better retrieval performance than BLAST on a large (5,161 queries) test database and 26.8% better retrieval score for queries belonging to small superfamilies. Furthermore, BLAST FDR retrieved only 0.27 irrelevant sequences per query compared to 7.44 for BLAST.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Hyrum D.

05e058e1f8f5ceb799ed3f71121d81efa6d41f7c,A comparison of per sample global scaling and per gene normalization methods for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data,"Normalization is an essential step with considerable impact on high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data analysis. Although there are numerous methods for read count normalization, it remains a challenge to choose an optimal method due to multiple factors contributing to read count variability that affects the overall sensitivity and specificity. In order to properly determine the most appropriate normalization methods, it is critical to compare the performance and shortcomings of a representative set of normalization routines based on different dataset characteristics. Therefore, we set out to evaluate the performance of the commonly used methods (DESeq, TMM-edgeR, FPKM-CuffDiff, TC, Med UQ and FQ) and two new methods we propose: Med-pgQ2 and UQ-pgQ2 (per-gene normalization after per-sample median or upper-quartile global scaling). Our per-gene normalization approach allows for comparisons between conditions based on similar count levels. Using the benchmark Microarray Quality Control Project (MAQC) and simulated datasets, we performed differential gene expression analysis to evaluate these methods. When evaluating MAQC2 with two replicates, we observed that Med-pgQ2 and UQ-pgQ2 achieved a slightly higher area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), a specificity rate > 85%, the detection power > 92% and an actual false discovery rate (FDR) under 0.06 given the nominal FDR (â‰¤0.05). Although the top commonly used methods (DESeq and TMM-edgeR) yield a higher power (>93%) for MAQC2 data, they trade off with a reduced specificity (<70%) and a slightly higher actual FDR than our proposed methods. In addition, the results from an analysis based on the qualitative characteristics of sample distribution for MAQC2 and human breast cancer datasets show that only our gene-wise normalization methods corrected data skewed towards lower read counts. However, when we evaluated MAQC3 with less variation in five replicates, all methods performed similarly. Thus, our proposed Med-pgQ2 and UQ-pgQ2 methods perform slightly better for differential gene analysis of RNA-seq data skewed towards lowly expressed read counts with high variation by improving specificity while maintaining a good detection power with a control of the nominal FDR level.",2017,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaohong Li"", ids = ""40062339""); list(name = ""Guy N.

b5b011f471c08c0de8257162b13e90a703d15712,Evidence that genes involved in hedgehog signaling are associated with both bipolar disorder and high BMI,"Patients with bipolar disorder (BD) show higher frequency of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), but the underlying genetic determinants and molecular pathways are not well studied. Using large publicly available datasets, we (1) conducted a gene-based analysis using MAGMA to identify genes associated with BD and body mass index (BMI) or T2D and investigated their functional enrichment; and (2) performed two meta-analyses between BD and BMI, as well as BD and T2D using Metasoft. Target druggability was assessed using the Drug Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb). We identified 518 and 390 genes significantly associated with BD and BMI or BD and T2D, respectively. A total of 52 and 12 genes, respectively, were significant after multiple testing correction. Pathway analyses conducted on nominally significant targets showed that genes associated with BD and BMI were enriched for the Neuronal cell body Gene Ontology (GO) term (pâ€‰=â€‰1.0Eâˆ’04; false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰=â€‰0.025) and different pathways, including the Signaling by Hedgehog pathway (pâ€‰=â€‰4.8Eâˆ’05, FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.02), while genes associated with BD and T2D showed no specific enrichment. The meta-analysis between BD and BMI identified 64 relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). While the majority of these were located in intergenic regions or in a locus on chromosome 16 near and in the NPIPL1 and SH2B1 genes (best SNP: rs4788101, pâ€‰=â€‰2.1Eâˆ’24), five were located in the ETV5 gene (best SNP: rs1516725, pâ€‰=â€‰1Eâˆ’24), which was previously associated with both BD and obesity, and one in the RPGRIP1L gene (rs1477199, pâ€‰=â€‰5.7Eâˆ’09), which was also included in the Signaling by Hedgehog pathway. The meta-analysis between BD and T2D identified six significant SNPs, three of which were located in ALAS1 (best SNP: rs352165, pâ€‰=â€‰3.4Eâˆ’08). Thirteen SNPs associated with BD and BMI, and one with BD and T2D, were located in genes which are part of the druggable genome. Our results support the hypothesis of shared genetic determinants between BD and BMI and point to genes involved in Hedgehog signaling as promising targets.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Claudia Pisanu"", ids = ""4706830""); list(name = ""Michael J Williams"", ids = ""47638177""); list(name = ""Diana M Ciuculete"", ids = ""46792651""); list(name = ""Gaia Olivo"", ids = ""36635198""); list(name = ""Maria del Zompo"", ids = ""114764619""); list(name = ""Alessio Squassina"", ids = ""2775742""); list(name = ""Helgi B.

8083560081e65b7f0083d355b50e28e13c2e7774,Enhancing sensitivity and controlling false discovery rate in somatic indel discovery using a latent variable model,"Cancer is a genetic disorder in the first place. Therefore, next-generation sequencing (NGS) based discovery of somatically acquired genetic variants has gained widespread attention. Computational prediction of somatic variants, however, is affected by a variety of confounding factors. In addition to the uncertainties that one commonly encounters also in germline variation prediction, such as misplaced and/or inaccurate read alignments, cancer heterogeneity and impure samples significantly add to the issues. Overall, this hampers state-of-the-art indel discovery tools to discover somatic indels at operable performance rates, although they perform excellently when calling germline indels. While affecting all size ranges, both common and cancer-specific problems interfere in particularly unfavorable ways in the prediction of somatic midsize (30-150 bp) insertions and deletions. Here, we present a latent variable model that can take the major confounding factors and uncertainties into a unifying account. Using this modeling framework, we first demonstrate how to efficiently compute the probability for a (putative) indel to be somatic, thereby resolving a principled computational runtime bottleneck in Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Second, we show how to reliably estimate the allele frequencies for a given list of indels. Third, we also present an intuitive and effective way to control the false discovery rate, an issue in genetic variant discovery that has been found notoriously hard to deal with. As a tool that implements all methodology developed, we present PROSIC (PROcessing Somatic Indel Calls). PROSIC achieves significant improvements in particular in terms of recall when applied to deletion call sheets, as provided by prevalent state-of-the-art tools, in comparison to their integrated somatic indel calling routines.

068a6c299f8fc27ad2fb3c27f4456481bee5999b,Elevated Functional Connectivity Along a Corticostriatal Loop and the Mechanism of Auditory/Verbal Hallucinations in Patients with Schizophrenia,"BACKGROUND
Higher levels of inter-region functional coordination can facilitate emergence of neural activity as conscious percepts. We consequently tested the hypothesis that auditory/verbal hallucinations (AVHs) arise from elevated functional coordination within a speech processing network.


METHODS
Functional coordination was indexed with functional connectivity (FC) computed from functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Thirty-two patients with schizophrenia reporting AVHs, 24 similarly diagnosed patients without hallucinations, and 23 healthy control subjects were studied. FC was seeded from a bilateral Wernicke's region delineated according to activation detected during AVHs in a prior study.


RESULTS
Wernicke's-seeded FC with Brodmann area 45/46 of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was significantly greater for hallucinating patients compared with nonhallucinating patients but not compared with healthy control subjects. In contrast, Wernicke's-seeded FC with a large subcortical region that included the thalamus, midbrain, and putamen was significantly greater for the combined patient group compared with healthy control subjects after false discovery rate correction, but not when comparing the two patient groups. Within that subcortical domain, the putamen demonstrated significantly greater FC relative to a secondary left IFG seed region when hallucinators were compared with nonhallucinating patients. A follow-up analysis found that FC summed along a loop linking the Wernicke's and IFG seed regions and the putamen was robustly greater for hallucinating patients compared with nonhallucinating patients and healthy control subjects.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that higher levels of functional coordination intrinsic to a corticostriatal loop comprise a causal factor leading to AVHs in schizophrenia.",2011,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ralph E.

3077546bbea3b38acf3f6b0b8634e40ec4c3ed7e,Detection and Localization in Sensor Networks Using Distributed FDR,"Wireless sensor networks (SNET) have gained substantial interest for detection and localization of objects, however network energy constraints make it difficult to implement optimal solutions in distributed settings. For object localization with known power, maximum likelihood estimation is the optimal solution, however in many applications it involves performing optimization over a non-convex function, which can be hard to solve even in centralized schemes. Furthermore, the computational complexity of finding this solution is prohibitively large to be implemented in distributed SNETs under energy constraints. In this work we consider the problem of distributed detection and localization of an object that emits a signal with unknown power. Considering the energy constraints of SNETs, we propose a novel technique that makes use of the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure and a belief propagation (BP) like algorithm for detection and localization problems. Inclusion of FDR to the detection process limits the communications necessary to detect the presence of the object as well as the energy consumption to locate it, prolonging the network lifetime. The simulation studies show that this approach is very well suited for detection and localization problems where the signal power of the object decays rapidly with distance.",2006,Computer Science,"list(name = ""E.B.

It also provides all performed indexing to facilitate global analysis of the data. The relevance of such tool is that there has been an increase in the number of proteogenomic efforts to improve the annotation of both genomics and proteomics data, culminating with the release of the two human proteome drafts. It is now clear that mass spectrometry-based peptide identification of uncharacterized sequences, such as those resulting from unpredicted exon joints or non-coding regions, is still prone to a higher than expected false discovery rate. Therefore, proper visualization of the raw data and the corresponding genome alignments are fundamental for further data validation and interpretation.

cb95ebe5f22cb56dd95c1912f4543de6348ad1c3,Multiple hypothesis testing in proteomics: A strategy for experimental work.,"In quantitative proteomics work, the differences in expression of many separate proteins are routinely examined to test for significant differences between treatments. This leads to the multiple hypothesis testing problem: when many separate tests are performed many will be significant by chance and be false positive results. Statistical methods such as the false discovery rate (FDR) method that deal with this problem have been disseminated for more than one decade. However a survey of proteomics journals shows that such tests are not widely implemented in one commonly used technique, quantitative proteomics using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). We outline a selection of multiple hypothesis testing methods, including some that are well known and some lesser known, and present a simple strategy for their use by the experimental scientist in quantitative proteomics work generally. The strategy focuses on the desirability of simultaneous use of several different methods, the choice and emphasis dependent on research priorities and the results in hand. This approach is demonstrated using case scenarios with experimental and simulated model data.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Angel P.

7670bcaad6933d39d15a560ccdfab881edb14053,False discovery rate control in two-stage designs,"BackgroundFor gene expression or gene association studies with a large number of hypotheses the number of measurements per marker in a conventional single-stage design is often low due to limited resources. Two-stage designs have been proposed where in a first stage promising hypotheses are identified and further investigated in the second stage with larger sample sizes. For two types of two-stage designs proposed in the literature we derive multiple testing procedures controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) demonstrating FDR control by simulations: designs where a fixed number of top-ranked hypotheses are selected and designs where the selection in the interim analysis is based on an FDR threshold. In contrast to earlier approaches which use only the second-stage data in the hypothesis tests (pilot approach), the proposed testing procedures are based on the pooled data from both stages (integrated approach).ResultsFor both selection rules the multiple testing procedures control the FDR in the considered simulation scenarios. This holds for the case of independent observations across hypotheses as well as for certain correlation structures. Additionally, we show that in scenarios with small effect sizes the testing procedures based on the pooled data from both stages can give a considerable improvement in power compared to tests based on the second-stage data only.ConclusionThe proposed hypothesis tests provide a tool for FDR control for the considered two-stage designs. Comparing the integrated approaches for both selection rules with the corresponding pilot approaches showed an advantage of the integrated approach in many simulation scenarios.",2011,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sonja Zehetmayer"", ids = ""3167970""); list(name = ""Martin Posch"", ids = ""2470495"")",b76ecf57c95524129701e19133c389711e46b77e; dd540ea55a1f39644fa8d269988e5876a0538c5f; c36b0c6783047cded1a351307a729831e86cf31a; 9cee4bf5ae08bdd342127281873c16cde824dac2; 408a0f8a287f4799d7c591e8ab2699e61ec3d828,23f97aa433d131680de6dcb10833d6d257f2799c; 866e0a0a45027c4b0cdd6a8443e559b0a712fb2b; b2782a7ca0f90328a4e54460b43d03770eb6291e; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; e187ea180e5993197b08b5978ab6981388c572b1; 1ca20a49a125b649c833975174f4e3f99ed0c76f; 8a1e1f340cd16c0b376aaf6629c4bc3dc5650f33; c1fb5cbe9a010820e9ed79427ffae1198eee808f; 3ea5160839adde27eab46b96b2ec41ed8305ddb6; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 1e68b68b919772f417984dd191596967056e1558; e316494831df32014ae06b623c05f13a766f3879; 857f7b6708def88ab493029c65907641a914c55e; c70d1123b8d398481f124950784506fc96f8549c; 4d6b423bda8656d8d46e5fde5ad833f97e278028; b2b16a9bf487b00f80801ff57c7cbb96503a9e81; e338b23bc619f95af3908cba5721b8b16dd4457f; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 73103b31745cb4636488f91b7fbfaf9670a22044; aedf452469b3babc395a7d3071eee564eff7e4f5; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643,BMC Bioinformatics,13,81 - 81
6ebfb663ff8ac0376433a204604edf0c7c280cf5,Low-frequency EEG correlates of fMRI in the resting state,"Recently, researchers have taken interest in simultaneously recording electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the relationship between the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal and underlying neuronal activity[1]. Many studies investigate BOLD signal relationship to high-pass (> 1 Hz) filtered EEG data, but little work on has been done on slow (< 1Hz) cortical potential correlates of fMRI because low frequency EEG data are commonly discarded as drift artifacts[1]. Nevertheless, much slower (< 0.1 Hz) components of the fMRI signal are used to establish functional resting state networks (RSNs) within the brain[2]. In this study, five subjects underwent simultaneous recording of EEG and fMRI in a resting state, lying quietly with eyes open. Two ten minute scans were acquired per subject over the entire brain (TR=2 seconds, TE=30 milliseconds, 64x64 voxels, 33 slices). After standard functional connectivity preprocessing[3], the BOLD signals were band-pass filtered between 0.01 â€“ 0.08 Hz. EEG data were obtained from a 64-channel electrode montage in a standard International 10-10 System configuration. Each signal was then filtered between 0.01 â€“ 0.08 Hz and de-noised of scanner and ballistocardiographic artifacts. Channels were clustered using k-means and each clusterâ€™s signal was calculated in order to be regressed from its respective electrodes. All EEG data were resampled to 0.5 Hz for comparison with functional data. Pearson correlation was then computed between pairs of individual EEG electrodes. Two electrode channels (AF3 and PO8) were chosen to be cross-correlated with BOLD signals at various time shifts between -10 â€“ 20 seconds, due to their consistent presence in anticorrelated clusters from the paired EEG clustering. This was performed both with and without EEG cluster signal removal, the former allowing better visualization of correlation results. Finally, all subjectsâ€™ electrode-specific EEG-fMRI correlations were averaged together and two maps of correlation were produced (Figure â€‹(Figure1).1). These maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate of 0.05, assuming a normal distribution of correlation values. The relationship between BOLD signals and slow cortical potentials can be observed over the sensorimotor cortex for both AF3 and PO8, demonstrating a correlation between EEG and a known RSN[2]. The time delays in correlation may also be related to previously observed BOLD signal propagations[3].

8cfdbb1dcf444481bd129ac3e4dc42b8742e68b7,Optimization of Search Engines and Postprocessing Approaches to Maximize Peptide and Protein Identification for High-Resolution Mass Data.,"The two key steps for analyzing proteomic data generated by high-resolution MS are database searching and postprocessing. While the two steps are interrelated, studies on their combinatory effects and the optimization of these procedures have not been adequately conducted. Here, we investigated the performance of three popular search engines (SEQUEST, Mascot, and MS Amanda) in conjunction with five filtering approaches, including respective score-based filtering, a group-based approach, local false discovery rate (LFDR), PeptideProphet, and Percolator. A total of eight data sets from various proteomes (e.g., E. coli, yeast, and human) produced by various instruments with high-accuracy survey scan (MS1) and high- or low-accuracy fragment ion scan (MS2) (LTQ-Orbitrap, Orbitrap-Velos, Orbitrap-Elite, Q-Exactive, Orbitrap-Fusion, and Q-TOF) were analyzed. It was found combinations involving Percolator achieved markedly more peptide and protein identifications at the same FDR level than the other 12 combinations for all data sets. Among these, combinations of SEQUEST-Percolator and MS Amanda-Percolator provided slightly better performances for data sets with low-accuracy MS2 (ion trap or IT) and high accuracy MS2 (Orbitrap or TOF), respectively, than did other methods. For approaches without Percolator, SEQUEST-group performs the best for data sets with MS2 produced by collision-induced dissociation (CID) and IT analysis; Mascot-LFDR gives more identifications for data sets generated by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) and analyzed in Orbitrap (HCD-OT) and in Orbitrap Fusion (HCD-IT); MS Amanda-Group excels for the Q-TOF data set and the Orbitrap Velos HCD-OT data set. Therefore, if Percolator was not used, a specific combination should be applied for each type of data set. Moreover, a higher percentage of multiple-peptide proteins and lower variation of protein spectral counts were observed when analyzing technical replicates using Percolator-associated combinations; therefore, Percolator enhanced the reliability for both identification and quantification. The analyses were performed using the specific programs embedded in Proteome Discoverer, Scaffold, and an in-house algorithm (BuildSummary).

Although the univariate methods revealed important aberrance of local morphometry in OCD patients, the covariance structure of the anatomical alterations remains unclear. Motivated by recent developments of multivariate techniques in the neuroimaging field, we applied a fusion method called ""mCCA+jICA"" on multimodal structural data of T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 30 unmedicated patients with OCD and 34 healthy controls. Amongst six highly correlated multimodal networks (p < 0.0001), we found significant alterations of the interrelated gray and white matter networks over occipital and parietal cortices, frontal interhemispheric connections and cerebella (False Discovery Rate q â‰¤ 0.05). In addition, we found white matter networks around basal ganglia that correlated with a subdimension of OC symptoms, namely 'harm/checking' (q â‰¤ 0.05). The present study not only agrees with the previous unimodal findings of OCD, but also quantifies the association of the altered networks across imaging modalities.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Seung-Goo Kim"", ids = ""2007869""); list(name = ""Wi Hoon Jung"", ids = ""3142432""); list(name = ""Sung Hea Kim"", ids = ""52185760""); list(name = ""Joon Hwan Jang"", ids = ""2540539""); list(name = ""Jun Hyeong Kwon"", ids = ""89097063"")",83f75505c6dfe6a3eb80446d79a93c89d0a0ab2c; 0103fcf62f16d690e29bebc4ebad20f6067198cb; 9924cb4ef960157e56b9eaf3e88bb1af21454f6d; c1f82ed52b45e152a1c56f174e27a7fcc2dc70d9; 0977519caa0d1686123b9fa9be9770058b1beeda; 3c63f064421c35e203ee580179895e20f41fc2e8; 7b0944c9e945f1b59caf56f024963a34a2608b1d; 9afbfe958426b10f81da465f6656abfc52c55be9; 7cbd27db52a25e3629631483341c9d75017bf69d; 4cd576a8bba91c1c6c2e4b1e1af4b113c0f1ae19; 60d378175edb3416b05896da26bccdd918f34cd7; 5ec044e51424ed35c8c46aff75edc73d54fd67b6,c8a25a17915889b1e620baca5b84901931aba0cb; 40d1b75610f18ab3d34d3443821df689d25bca6a; bd58ef4c69a5adf9137555d396fb2562ed51fa87; da0816e7c1d0077ecd0c51385ec3371fb6c01f8e; ae516c5ea6779138bbea21b1c6fe6ac2a83cbc99; 72634c447be14bee1cc10409e215d35acdb6e5c0; d4e63e0225d61ba818e12d5cfbab6138040b72f3; cfd6ad813148da71b63d4110fc87beec4a390d26; c923c263be6a515cf2764581b10a6e22213ffdca; d0ec486f440158e086968d51e4141355694ff35d; 7178ca37ca5f35d44f60cef106b5f6da0b94577a; 48ce1f0445746ed8af79a592248a1f637d714a27; b2a0019a0f5084bcf3f435c0f571a0d2a615b422; 1a3e334f16b6888843a8150ddf7e4f46b2b28fd5; 7a7971e33fe95a7e1efc776a447b09886f5cb188; 84f2a000ec32f9394ca6cd823c5cf724be9b5a9b; 948ed28c53cafe239c6fdc2994fb1bee9232f761; e270fa506f1ccdde82ee89cd0274372c143fedb7; fbe1445c656258ef0fa07da387bcac73904b7079; f59771b5311be88d99b8f0f14aff609373577b0f; c212a92e133ccb61ac50b779c9b0bc330dd6e3cf; 42581fd21a834d24123303c9c387c7108b02891a; ad4e281293237bdb8efbbd639ac823536815f42b; 3dbc1b8af425dd28ef46b17ac9b87895742e6910; c1fadf8de5708abc218ac34ced400ccf724b0d96; 4da349db8c168773e10123a133c63922a456cb03; c418fbb52852617b6f36d92f237d65def95f41a4; 630d43ecd60470f2cacf72cc78e767bafc3ce2a5; 8d022f470fbe346a1369eb5bfd9a0076fd1760bb; 890c60d0771df5a121e9d74f3eea5b252e7353e7; 8f25482d438cf561345d67e29fcc61b16d8257b6; 3da680c0e4bdd9b0483d558abb53308d33522fb2; 1f7d99b55761a3af7d0b8f86450834ccdce4da6e; 42168ff14fdccde35d5794ccc9484d4b98fb3fbb; eb4a921ef5953ee0b31d8c15f3479897acb918d1; 236cb915a1724c4b9ec3e53cfed64ce169358cda; c09fa9d9c39657a7a236dfe9b080695c1c2f4d03; bb12f556970c1ede47b2df6ed7d89b90ddf9d53e; 49de87a02dc4fb4660e00b5034100ab88eb8611d; 59c0084251f91a5b3715f10cb3ac43a62e157546; 1682f511cd0566cb6dec37b75024a4dc16822542; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; bb7de3ebe5a6b18efb8b32dc126a17dcf43a5660; 669ae66b91d2beb0689a11025ba859a9aa95819f; 57ef2f885be41518daef1eaaf28d5ce49324e6de; ff9750a1278b31c846eadef832dc6e442068e417; 082f4b7d6d3d6f95702e81390402ded3a911950a; d389fe752b2600401e944604724a10e00bf5a475; 9bdb4a596031db229bc142ed9686f8e9180d7566; 858cb373f1d7863384420a33f1d1e577812df14c; afcf18aa56093498e509c8df2d4e1e479ecc9b43; 1863ec946de33cda46a81b1176674a413397e8fb; 44d9fed68f0ffd8f0d97030f2faec07ca26f089e; 60037c4a92484869a03c72186b04ce007b33ac46; 03adca66d741d9194aeb228bb478e0e49e7f0f2e; 46fc0d8bbd48d037332536928495187c98d78940; 6081b5fcea0f47e525db2edf809fc7af66fe96bc; d83b604660596d9d69c9d0f13c76c3df3751d5b5; ab35fae1d7f03015c02f60f8db2c74cc780a6842; 60fd93682301f3480e17781d49fb1f8c15536aa5; 23e479b976d97d77b5f1c40767383c6d2c66af07; a5f2a78ac9e476bafe6267c354dd76dbc2fdecd0; 5714bcc2ea4b4e0a4065b56f249adb0f9ee7f07e; e7b86b6a19abf0d3fa9c7641f496b3e93af2d485; 802fdfe0f87a6ecb635f8f9b2ad8eca89cf1eb74; f472b381f1adb9070574cbfa6bf68c8185cff100; cd7361d934fb3f2516aebd1479951ca7af21647f; 512e62d2c4f07e0fcecfec7373332430e1c49ea0; 711b31ee9e09948429083bd1004ed2af6fe1d6f5; 1d7d0e8c4791700defd4b0df82a26b50055346e0; a95ee2e0590502d6135024ef5010610cb5a032f8; 780b1a9071e52875c8c8401d0c97175513829df0; 12667b4674028ec206ba7aa5635e9b3876cefa9a; 506cfa1e106624c95c8965bbda92f1e122127836; 904aa207f580b6ea6df7dd88e094ea0f43ec3a43; 89c8eccf21846a5880e54f772579793512efb523; 733b8f449375308a19fe5fdeef7cc64d04b55c1f; dcadc8fc5bf5534c20824842d8719e33c4ee2640; cb99f4f602592458056d287458f6c34b5a1e2a6f; 1308f07cbb9ab821883089b75dfc991f7d10fffb; c61304f9ec11d8c23d0d590dcd9db177b46f9713,PLoS ONE,10,

The global level of the multiple test is controlled by the false discovery rate (FDR) criterion recently suggested by Benjamini and Hochberg. In previous studies, the suggested procedure has shown promising results on both simulated and real data. Here we carefully examine the consistency property of the multiple test procedure. Applying the asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, we prove strong consistency under a mild condition on signal and noise eigenvalues. This condition enables us to find the minimum SNR to ensure consistency.

65bb57d955ba1c2de31806619f004f4dd726d92b,Sympathectomy suppresses tumor growth and alters gene-expression profiles in rat tongue cancer.,"Sympathetic nerves are known to affect carcinogenesis. Recently we found that sympathetic denervation decreases the size of rat tongue tumors. To identify genes involved in rat tongue carcinogenesis and to study the effect of sympathetic nerves on these genes, we compared gene-expression profiles in normal rat tongue (control) and in tumor-induced tongues with (SCGx) and without (Sham) bilateral sympathectomy. Significance analysis of microarrays revealed 280 genes (168 up-regulated, 112 down-regulated) that showed at least a twofold differential expression between Sham and SCGx tumors (false discovery rate < 5%). These included genes associated with cell adhesion, signaling, structure, proliferation, metabolism, angiogenesis, development, and immunity. Hierarchical clustering demonstrated that controls and sympathectomized tumors grouped together, while Sham tumors grouped separately. We identified 34 genes, known to be involved in carcinogenesis, that were not differentially expressed between sympathectomized tumors and control tongues, but which showed a significant change in expression in Sham tumors. Microarray results of 12 of these genes were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, sympathectomy significantly altered the gene-expression profile and inhibited tumor growth. The expression of several cancer genes were increased more than threefold in Sham tumors, but unaltered in the sympathectomized tumors when compared with controls, indicating that these genes may be of significance in rat tongue carcinogenesis.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""B.

This study investigates the origin, formation, and specificity of circulating microparticles (MPs) in patients with SLE based on comprehensive MP proteome profiling using patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and healthy donors (HC) as controls. Methods: We purified MPs from platelet-poor plasma using differential centrifugation of samples from SLE (n = 45), SSc (n = 38), and two sets of HC (n = 35, n = 25). MP proteins were identified and quantitated after trypsin digestion by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The abundance of specific proteins was compared between the groups using univariate statistics and false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons. Specific proteins and protein ratios were explored for diagnostic and disease activity information using receiver-operating characteristic curves and by analysis of correlations of protein abundance with disease activity scores. Results: We identify and quantitate more than 1000 MP proteins and show that a subpopulation of SLE-MPs (which we propose to call luposomes) are highly specific for SLE, i.e. not found in MP preparations from HC or patients with another autoimmune, systemic disease, SSc. In SLE-MPs platelet proteins and mitochondrial proteins are significantly diminished, cytoskeletal proteins deranged, and glycolytic enzymes and apoptotic proteins significantly increased. Conclusions: Normal MPs are efficiently removed in SLE, but aberrant MPs, derived from non-lymphoid leukocytes, are less efficiently removed and abundantly produced leading to an altered MP proteome in SLE.

8919018f525e00b9ed65cc2d98cf3fe7c13d5478,Lipoxins Regulate the Early Growth Response-1 Network and Reverse Diabetic Kidney Disease.,"Background The failure of spontaneous resolution underlies chronic inflammatory conditions, including microvascular complications of diabetes such as diabetic kidney disease. The identification of endogenously generated molecules that promote the physiologic resolution of inflammation suggests that these bioactions may have therapeutic potential in the context of chronic inflammation. Lipoxins (LXs) are lipid mediators that promote the resolution of inflammation.Methods We investigated the potential of LXA4 and a synthetic LX analog (Benzo-LXA4) as therapeutics in a murine model of diabetic kidney disease, ApoE-/- mice treated with streptozotocin.Results Intraperitoneal injection of LXs attenuated the development of diabetes-induced albuminuria, mesangial expansion, and collagen deposition. Notably, LXs administered 10 weeks after disease onset also attenuated established kidney disease, with evidence of preserved kidney function. Kidney transcriptome profiling defined a diabetic signature (725 genes; false discovery rate Pâ‰¤0.05). Comparison of this murine gene signature with that of human diabetic kidney disease identified shared renal proinflammatory/profibrotic signals (TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², NF-ÎºB). In diabetic mice, we identified 20 and 51 transcripts regulated by LXA4 and Benzo-LXA4, respectively, and pathway analysis identified established (TGF-Î²1, PDGF, TNF-Î±, NF-ÎºB) and novel (early growth response-1 [EGR-1]) networks activated in diabetes and regulated by LXs. In cultured human renal epithelial cells, treatment with LXs attenuated TNF-Î±-driven Egr-1 activation, and Egr-1 depletion prevented cellular responses to TGF-Î²1 and TNF-Î±Conclusions These data demonstrate that LXs can reverse established diabetic complications and support a therapeutic paradigm to promote the resolution of inflammation.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eoin P Brennan"", ids = ""29644091""); list(name = ""Muthukumar Mohan"", ids = ""50276183""); list(name = ""Aaron McClelland"", ids = ""49278842""); list(name = ""Christos Tikellis"", ids = ""34319575""); list(name = ""Mark Ziemann"", ids = ""2290957""); list(name = ""Antony Kaspi"", ids = ""2051476""); list(name = ""Stephen P.

f81775d06dda59ea6e1b3bacdf070d5307027059,"Statistical methods in detecting differential expressed genes, analyzing insertion tolerance for genes and group selection for survival data","The thesis is composed of three independent projects: (i) analyzing transposon-sequencing data to infer functions of genes on bacteria growth (chapter 2), (ii) developing semi-parametric Bayesian method method for differential gene expression analysis with RNA-sequencing data (chapter 3), (iii) solving group selection problem for survival data (chapter 4). All projects are motivated by statistical challenges raised in biological research. The first project is motivated by the need to develop statistical models to accommodate the transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-Seq) data, Tn-Seq data consist of sequence reads around each transposon insertion site. The detection of transposon insertion at a given site indicates that the disruption of genomic sequence at this site does not cause essential function loss and the bacteria can still grow. Hence, such measurements have been used to infer the functions of each gene on bacteria growth. We propose a zero-inflated Poisson regression method for analyzing the Tn-Seq count data, and derive an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain parameter estimates. We also propose a multiple testing procedure that categorizes genes into each of the three states, hypo-tolerant, tolerant, and hyper-tolerant, while controlling false discovery rate. Simulation studies show our method provides good estimation of model parameters and inference on gene functions. In the second project, we model the count data from RNA-sequencing experiment for each gene using a Poisson-Gamma hierarchical model, or equivalently, a negative binomial (NB) model. We derive a full semi-parametric Bayesian approach with Dirichlet process as the prior for the fold changes between two treatment means. An inference strategy using Gibbs algorithm is developed for differential expression analysis. We evaluate our method with several simulation studies, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms other methods including the popularly applied ones such as edgeR and DESeq. In the third project, we develop a new semi-parametric Bayesian method to address the",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Fangfang Liu"", ids = ""47185559"")",,37cae00437f3d00a8aff2417fe6354137fc04999; b1e99c01e2f1f5783d476b78c8d0503623f3891c; d7632aa87f9d79857919cbfe97ddb80795c5a93e; 59bde7b3624469ed5913f6026b9c1a81985fe81d; 90947c64553041bb83ce5fd97e7782a75ce77d25; 944006623073b2ea016b1040c64a74e857974bfc; 347fce82a38081dee853c73a9b553d92d13fa6f6; c1a38f4b9b4ad8d44a3bafe8849eabe1c6683377; b53f4a5d57762d42b5a34889c64d4bdad79b345f; 2e2da6822c026dee4114921cc8a0babc7251b862; 3fee10ad742de667137378c8b375d1c131f8353c; 7cae14836295b4dc43bbc66e7295658d9d4932d4; 3daa1216f7e6f7118ecc52c5f453d05891214bab; fb23fce3727c5adf0f6a055114aa00cf547a4dc8; feb623f795261f4577e2d40c7dedc737027a2c12; b9094d1dbd512ebf6bd938ab05d9929f7ca08a02; e70ba61fab6dfbc4506fc86ed19698cfd9db9384; 00416b38c6ae3f13dbdb3a4fe8e720b5036bba0f; 2bc019700d91ed7d6a545cd367b68ec50890c299; eb7ba495d2adb625347448f0b30dca86f9f3d3f1; be9e72f6d5d852da757d821230daadddbc58c8bd; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; cdb6d57f4e94b017f4400d518b5bf42e7e76bf6d; 0d329170e6727430918b8527e8ba77b12bbab127; e6345825ff9ce994d35bdee7a0774833668ed6e3; 28ba2943378374d7e1264f39e81f5615651e8653; a8455c744b06c41190abcc045e247d11bc1d794d; aed20302f003a751b1af4e40ace379b9fd255cc7; df610ee94b20697ee37df6832b47b214ce443df0; 785ede21535ff3a4ccc75daa990e45363db3a363; 80b6df0b985e25755bbbcabe3e8662afa65782c0; b18c4aa130246575346877529afa57c39656026e; f300013eb9082ff357d80ea69fb067f30b965780; 08600900eac695fdba3bf453c6f02a6bf4b7f236; 8a05842c382ebbefccb95da34c1b8ac7f68605c7; 829b659f96771f2076ab325b1202b26085b300b4; d220b7869f286ff9e5344afb1572ab00feaeacd7; 6ba13c951fdc3cc472a8ceeba02142299236f1f4; 8d990deca66c9afefbe042f95e41ada0c7227877; 67f795ed7ccf166bcef01e812d9989aa3058355b; 821f2d4302c0b61376c5598d8a488a57b4a3be6c; c5f2d48863c5b745d82f19cb60eea750fa11494b; ebaadc1e1ecc158317cdc42aaae02b3ad7096260; b36e16dedacfc738b734bef8906a4ef7f3ca6994; 1b32d466d2c756e1dbcef9ff94e1be895e84700d; 35f03921a48e03687333b9d275bf5e58bd2520b8; 263f103fd2bfbbd6aeb392c6519d3f590e647c0a; 2bbb05640a79fb9704fb62289eb2de81ee154b7e; 648a60e977dd72004f7f57e69ec3fe083d7c858b; 274806d32e03da3a5e3893b9119277de33abb2aa; 128c1c88ae25ef394155bd0dd763b3c51960f9f3; f5b16cfd19e10ea5bac433bb3cdb3a3f55d45dac; 92d47440e479b1625b6f70bba760999337d8e7e4; a25bd70b9b7f885767f8cea10e73d39246cad421; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; b8593122c6b1dd2432125a4eeb1a908c280b1d1d; 8d76672d52622d9c45014d630717ce911d1292ba; 1f95ea6bf5c66c4527edbf6b2410759d24839c6b; 3a28aa46fe0fc35c2ba60bb58a1298be9aacad6f; 1ba4fcafbe3e184dbd207ee5d491808a1bb42187; 10d5f67a88dd4acb2e5b493116100e48504e08b0,,,
1b72b908c6dc60400256a61921836095cdb45b04,Large Scale Mass Spectrometry-based Identifications of Enzyme-mediated Protein Methylation Are Subject to High False Discovery Rates.,"All large scale LC-MS/MS post-translational methylation site discovery experiments require methylpeptide spectrum matches (methyl-PSMs) to be identified at acceptably low false discovery rates (FDRs). To meet estimated methyl-PSM FDRs, methyl-PSM filtering criteria are often determined using the target-decoy approach. The efficacy of this methyl-PSM filtering approach has, however, yet to be thoroughly evaluated. Here, we conduct a systematic analysis of methyl-PSM FDRs across a range of sample preparation workflows (each differing in their exposure to the alcohols methanol and isopropyl alcohol) and mass spectrometric instrument platforms (each employing a different mode of MS/MS dissociation). Through (13)CD3-methionine labeling (heavy-methyl SILAC) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells and in-depth manual data inspection, accurate lists of true positive methyl-PSMs were determined, allowing methyl-PSM FDRs to be compared with target-decoy approach-derived methyl-PSM FDR estimates. These results show that global FDR estimates produce extremely unreliable methyl-PSM filtering criteria; we demonstrate that this is an unavoidable consequence of the high number of amino acid combinations capable of producing peptide sequences that are isobaric to methylated peptides of a different sequence. Separate methyl-PSM FDR estimates were also found to be unreliable due to prevalent sources of false positive methyl-PSMs that produce high peptide identity score distributions. Incorrect methylation site localizations, peptides containing cysteinyl-S-Î²-propionamide, and methylated glutamic or aspartic acid residues can partially, but not wholly, account for these false positive methyl-PSMs. Together, these results indicate that the target-decoy approach is an unreliable means of estimating methyl-PSM FDRs and methyl-PSM filtering criteria. We suggest that orthogonal methylpeptide validation (e.g. heavy-methyl SILAC or its offshoots) should be considered a prerequisite for obtaining high confidence methyl-PSMs in large scale LC-MS/MS methylation site discovery experiments and make recommendations on how to reduce methyl-PSM FDRs in samples not amenable to heavy isotope labeling.

a7560e619843867723de61131b0064e0c588c09b,Label-free quantitative proteomics analysis of antibiotic response in Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin.,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the leading cause of fatal bacterial infections in hospitals and has become a global health threat. Although the resistance mechanisms of Î²-lactam antibiotics have been studied for decades, there are few attempts at systems-wide investigations into how the bacteria respond to antibiotic stress. Spectral counting-based label-free quantitative proteomics has been applied to study global responses in MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) treated with subinhibitory doses of oxacillin, a model Î²-lactam antibiotic. We developed a simple and easily repeated sample preparation procedure that is effective for extracting surface-associated proteins. On average, 1025 and 1013 proteins were identified at a false discovery rate threshold of 0.01, for the untreated group of MRSA and MSSA. Upon treatment with oxacillin, 81 proteins (65 up-regulated, 16 down-regulated) were shown differentially expressed in MRSA (p < 0.05). In comparison, 225 proteins (162 up-regulated, 63 down-regulated) were shown differentially expressed in oxacillin-treated MSSA. Î²-Lactamase and penicillin-binding protein 2a were observed up-regulated uniquely in oxacillin-treated MRSA, which is consistent with the known Î²-lactam resistance mechanisms of S. aureus. More interestingly, the peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway and the pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis pathway were found to be up-regulated in both oxacillin-treated MRSA and MSSA, and a series of energy metabolism pathways were up-regulated uniquely in oxacillin-treated MSSA. These new data offer a more complete view of the proteome changes in bacteria in response to the antibiotic. This report is the first in using label-free quantitative proteomics to study Î²-lactam antibiotic responses in S. aureus.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Xiaofen Liu"", ids = ""49543476""); list(name = ""Yingwei Hu"", ids = ""7741582""); list(name = ""Pei-Jing Pai"", ids = ""49895350""); list(name = ""Daijie Chen"", ids = ""6885004""); list(name = ""Henry H.

91da4ea59f7b4ae1187a6b49789001fc614bd1e1,Blood DNA methylation and breast cancer risk: a meta-analysis of four prospective cohort studies,"BackgroundEnvironmental and genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of breast cancer. Several small blood-based DNA methylation studies have reported risk associations with methylation at individual CpGs and average methylation levels; however, these findings require validation in larger prospective cohort studies. To investigate the role of blood DNA methylation on breast cancer risk, we conducted a meta-analysis of four prospective cohort studies, including a total of 1663 incident cases and 1885 controls, the largest study of blood DNA methylation and breast cancer risk to date.MethodsWe assessed associations with methylation at 365,145 CpGs present in the HumanMethylation450 (HM450K) Beadchip, after excluding CpGs that did not pass quality controls in all studies. Each of the four cohorts estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between each individual CpG and breast cancer risk. In addition, each study assessed the association between average methylation measures and breast cancer risk, adjusted and unadjusted for cell-type composition. Study-specific ORs were combined using fixed-effect meta-analysis with inverse variance weights. Stratified analyses were conducted by age at diagnosis (<â€‰50, â‰¥â€‰50), estrogen receptor (ER) status (+/âˆ’), and time since blood collection (<â€‰5, 5â€“10, >â€‰10â€‰years). The false discovery rate (q value) was used to account for multiple testing.ResultsThe average age at blood draw ranged from 52.2 to 62.2â€‰years across the four cohorts. Median follow-up time ranged from 6.6 to 8.4â€‰years. The methylation measured at individual CpGs was not associated with breast cancer risk (q value >â€‰0.59). In addition, higher average methylation level was not associated with risk of breast cancer (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.94, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.85, 1.05; PÂ =â€‰0.26; P for study heterogeneityâ€‰=â€‰0.86). We found no evidence of modification of this association by age at diagnosis (PÂ =â€‰0.17), ER status (PÂ =â€‰0.88), time since blood collection (PÂ =â€‰0.98), or CpG location (PÂ =â€‰0.98).ConclusionsOur data indicate that DNA methylation measured in the blood prior to breast cancer diagnosis in predominantly postmenopausal women is unlikely to be associated with substantial breast cancer risk on the HM450K array. Larger studies or with greater methylation coverage are needed to determine if associations exist between blood DNA methylation and breast cancer risk.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Clara Bodelon"", ids = ""2554958""); list(name = ""Srikant Ambatipudi"", ids = ""51235697""); list(name = ""Pierre-Antoine DuguÃ©"", ids = ""49198258""); list(name = ""Annelie Johansson"", ids = ""46410751""); list(name = ""Joshua N.

57a7c5db6aaab825200b85beb0bebefaee15117c,Marginal false discovery rates for penalized regression models.,"Penalized regression methods are an attractive tool for high-dimensional data analysis, but their widespread adoption has been hampered by the difficulty of applying inferential tools. In particular, the question ""How reliable is the selection of those features?"" has proved difficult to address. In part, this difficulty arises from defining false discoveries in the classical, fully conditional sense, which is possible in low dimensions but does not scale well to high-dimensional settings. Here, we consider the analysis of marginal false discovery rates (mFDRs) for penalized regression methods. Restricting attention to the mFDR permits straightforward estimation of the number of selections that would likely have occurred by chance alone, and therefore provides a useful summary of selection reliability. Theoretical analysis and simulation studies demonstrate that this approach is quite accurate when the correlation among predictors is mild, and only slightly conservative when the correlation is stronger. Finally, the practical utility of the proposed method and its considerable advantages over other approaches are illustrated using gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and genome-wide association study data from the Myocardial Applied Genomics Network.",2019,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Patrick J Breheny"", ids = ""2119683"")",7381e4a51b42c1b044000566c78e8c9075327a89; 7ac54398e4bac7ff93313e34e19a6f2baa42f91b; 9e8efd072240b6eeb6d39b82395a2ccb143d7774; 1d9565fcf038fad5215d1e574ec04bbde371b9a4; b5325b5301627600580a93798ccd01308d235e22; 48c365fb304da4cad6389df84d8dac2828724d77; 3b4c2ea7458cfddaf48b95e23444eaa1380b0d8a; b6022e3ac9c75ff6e098c574d4ee93cfd8846d4f; 03f357cd27f939342cd44c173b82b5f0fbb14c23,2c04d5311caee78b3dddd90e5ad0ef509fc8a70d; db4b1e3f367ddcea27d660d3316f2916bf2ba84a; 5c7416638acf9836d0bd2dbb5c269c8e07604ad4; fb7d2beeb499bfe9f8665c95bea87d77c27e7385; 929f4c4fdf4df18911cb611ca9c43120de0cbffa; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 2609cb6ea895aabbf3c38632c3b1415f6224cd75; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 090b233a88ad0d0d31968745fe44c81a5a0e6dfe; c67136ab0e52283d5b3beef23fe318eb9f455cb7; c3620866f75cf4d2cd498abc91b598ae1ddd1300; d8f1ffeb7bcad215fcac25b0b0defcbc573d46e3; 905e264286c1b05a1f802659bb075a7cd5274492; 078fb305820f2e2479f2c6f517524eea522373de; e9133969c2fa2113948a2698a3f5ced97e219781; 8125d755ad1fa64b869657d0f102836908af7a09; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc; 300ae1297ef21fd7c7a029c7911f1d04f78a6922; 112e2d4f6ffbfba004576a159ffdf60f5dad8d3a; 3f1be94601fcb6f58cb4f6657d02c9a6136edef3; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6,Biostatistics,20 2,"

25cd3b85c9f937f3bee1229125a0e3ed16a33401,Empirical Prediction of Turnovers in NFL Football,"Turnovers in the National Football League (NFL) occur whenever a team loses possession of the ball due to a fumble, or an interception. Turnovers disrupt momentum of the offensive team, and represent lost opportunities to advance downfield and score. Teams with a positive differential turnover margin in a given game win 70 % of the time. Turnovers are statistically rare events, occurring apparently randomly. These characteristics make them difficult to predict. This investigation advances the hypothesis that turnovers are predictable in NFL football. Machine learning models are developed to learn the concept: At any point within a football game, what is the likelihood that a turnover will be observed on the next play from scrimmage? NFL play-by-play data for 32 teams spanning seven full seasons were used to train the models. Results presented suggest evidence to support the working hypothesis. Under certain conditions, both fumbles and interceptions can be anticipated at low false discovery rates (less than 15 % ). When a turnover is predicted on the impending play from scrimmage, a high degree of confidence is associated with that prediction. The ability to anticipate catastrophic in-game events may lead to their management and control, ultimately improving the performance of individual athletes and their teams. This investigation contributes to the sports science literature by demonstrating the predictability of in-game events often considered to be essentially random in their occurrence. To the author's knowledge, direct prediction of turnovers has not previously appeared in the literature, which has focused on retrospective statistical analyses of turnover margin in football games.",2016,Engineering; Medicine,"list(name = ""Joel R.

However, count statistics on discovered somatic insertions and deletions (indels) indicate that large amounts of discoveries are missed because of the quantification of uncertainties related to gap and alignment ambiguities, twilight zone indels, cancer heterogeneity, sample purity, sampling, and strand bias. We provide a unifying statistical model whose dependency structures enable accurate quantification of all inherent uncertainties in short time.

92a9f8ebed5927ffad88203063e43a59f19cf230,Genome-wide association study of drought tolerance and biomass allocation in wheat,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are important in discerning the genetic architecture of complex traits such as biomass allocation for improving drought tolerance and carbon sequestration potential of wheat. The objectives of this study were to deduce the population structure and marker-trait association for biomass traits in wheat under drought-stressed and non-stressed conditions. A 100-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotype panel was phenotyped for days to heading (DTH), days to maturity (DTM), shoot biomass (SB), root biomass (RB), root to shoot ratio (RS) and grain yield (GY). The panel was sequenced using 15,600 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) markers and subjected to genetic analysis using the compressed mixed linear model (CMLM) at false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05). Population structure analysis revealed six sub-clusters with high membership ancestry coefficient of â‰¤0.65 to their assigned sub-clusters. A total of 75 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) were identified with a linkage disequilibrium threshold of 0.38 at 5cM. Thirty-seven of the MTAs were detected under drought-stressed condition and 48% were on the B genome, where most quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for RB, SB and GY were previously identified.

7682605dda32c2ab5ca1ea81363493a28b3bd55f,The protective effect of club cell secretory protein (CC-16) on COPD risk and progression: a Mendelian randomisation study,"Background There are currently no robust biomarkers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk or progression. Club cell secretory protein-16 (CC-16) is associated with the clinical expression of COPD. We aimed to determine if there is a causal effect of serum CC-16 level on COPD risk and/or progression using Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis. Methods We performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis for serum CC-16 in two COPD cohorts (Lung Health Study [LHS], n=3,850 and ECLIPSE, n=1,702). We then used the CC-16-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MR analysis to estimate the causal effect of serum CC-16 on COPD risk (International COPD Genetics Consortium/UK-Biobank dataset; n=35,735 cases, n=222,076 controls) and progression (change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] in LHS and ECLIPSE). We also determined the associations between SNPs associated with CC-16 and gene expression using n=1,111 lung tissue samples from the Lung eQTL Study. Results We identified 7 SNPs independently associated (p<5Ã—10âˆ’8) with serum CC-16 levels; 6 of these were novel. MR analysis suggested a protective causal effect of increased serum CC-16 on COPD risk (p=0.008) and progression (LHS only, p=0.02). Five of the SNPs were also associated with gene expression in lung tissue, including that of the CC-16-encoding gene SCGB1A1 (false discovery rate<0.1). Conclusion We have identified several novel genetic variants associated with serum CC-16 level in COPD cohorts. These genetic associations suggest a potential causal effect of serum CC-16 on COPD risk and progression. Further investigation of CC-16 as a biomarker or therapeutic target in COPD is warranted. KEY MESSAGES What is the key question? Can genetics help uncover a causal effect of serum CC-16 level on COPD risk and/or progression? What is the bottom line? There is a protective effect of genetically-increased serum CC-16 on both COPD risk and progression (as measured by change in FEV1 over time), which may be due to increased expression of the CC-16-encoding gene SCGB1A1 in the lung. Why read on? This is the first study to demonstrate a possible causal effect of serum CC-16 in people with COPD, and highlights the potential for CC-16 as a biomarker or therapeutic target.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Stephen Milne"", ids = ""48330960""); list(name = ""Xuan Li"", ids = ""50079548""); list(name = ""Ana I.

Current understanding of the prostate AR cistrome - the genome-wide set of AR binding sites (ARBS) - is driven largely by tumor model systems. The role of the AR cistrome in prostate tumorigenesis in human tissue is unknown. We map the AR cistrome in 20 normal and tumor human prostate samples using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). Methods: Chromatin was extracted from 13 tumor and 7 matched histologically normal foci (>70% enrichment) from fresh-frozen radical prostatectomy specimens. Tissue was pulverized, fixed and sonicated then immunoprecipitated with antibody to AR; DNA was isolated; libraries were constructed for the Illumina platform; sequencing reads were aligned to the human genome using MACS (false discovery rate 0.01) Results: Median 19,602 ARBS were called per sample.

Control of pFDR critically depends on how much evidence is available from data to distinguish between false and true nulls. Oftentimes, as many aspects of the data distributions are unknown, one may not be able to obtain strong enough evidence from the data for pFDR control. This raises the question as to how much data are needed to attain a target pFDR level. We study the asymptotics of the minimum number of observations per null for the pFDR control associated with multiple Studentized tests and F tests, especially when the differences between false nulls and true nulls are small. For Studentized tests, we con- sider tests on shifts or other parameters associated with normal and general distributions. For F tests, we also take into account the effect of the num- ber of covariates in linear regression. The results show that in determining the minimum sample size per null for pFDR control, higher order statistical properties of data are important, and the number of covariates is important in tests to detect regression effects.",2007,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Zhiyi Chi"", ids = ""3140471"")",4c850f993f637e55275c902ae43cf6019592016a; 0b87de1dc5b30fbc2255ee7c366bccf65ebd8bec; a2eb99aebfa1ed3f211e815842ebf8de6967f728; 34382262d4407dbf2781acd514965b22c9350237; d60004fb5fe01f2ae4aacbb5f3839ed97d307661,d51139172202e5a5e0000415571deaf2b1ac0b72; 0cc325ee022c258b30da3247a60828f7adf4d14c; 6470ca07d9fe23f4f364a6584da954417644fb94; c91a14f5a1f3d588c08e9db47093da3cf1c0a493; 2b53d5bc069a71ef8e50a38b5de96bcfd1d6852c; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 15c790cfa8afff058ce02b342ebe20ee7c045750; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 9c277ec5dfa4cfb137b627b81a61651d8948173c; 1c09afaa4bdc00a66643c3d16504dec85474cde0; 03be636697c84eb22114f09de6c1bea215cc87c8; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; 04f7eb10b37138f3c1a962f8319fb60b690f8632; 3a00fd37ea0800bddf255722e691af52d41b72de; 7a99bdbff30ed200771e4c48e82bbb901c5c0095,Electronic Journal of Statistics,1,77-118

Traditional multiple comparison procedures such as familywise error rate (FWER) controlling procedures are too conservative. Although false discovery rate (FDR) procedures have been suggested as having greater power, the control itself is not exact and depends on the proportion of true null hypotheses. Because this proportion is unknown, it has to be accurately (small bias, small variance) estimated, preferably using a simple calculation that can be made accessible to the general scientific community. We propose an easy-to-implement method and make the R code available, for estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses. This estimate has relatively small bias and small variance as demonstrated by (simulated and real data) comparing it with four existing procedures.

0712aa16d989bd5445b8b3c9b86a5e057709ac82,PyQuant: A Versatile Framework for Analysis of Quantitative Mass Spectrometry Data.,"Quantitative mass spectrometry data necessitates an analytical pipeline that captures the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the experiments. Currently, data analysis is often coupled to specific software packages, which restricts the analysis to a given workflow and precludes a more thorough characterization of the data by other complementary tools. To address this, we have developed PyQuant, a cross-platform mass spectrometry data quantification application that is compatible with existing frameworks and can be used as a stand-alone quantification tool. PyQuant supports most types of quantitative mass spectrometry data including SILAC, NeuCode, (15)N, (13)C, or (18)O and chemical methods such as iTRAQ or TMT and provides the option of adding custom labeling strategies. In addition, PyQuant can perform specialized analyses such as quantifying isotopically labeled samples where the label has been metabolized into other amino acids and targeted quantification of selected ions independent of spectral assignment. PyQuant is capable of quantifying search results from popular proteomic frameworks such as MaxQuant, Proteome Discoverer, and the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline in addition to several standalone search engines. We have found that PyQuant routinely quantifies a greater proportion of spectral assignments, with increases ranging from 25-45% in this study. Finally, PyQuant is capable of complementing spectral assignments between replicates to quantify ions missed because of lack of MS/MS fragmentation or that were omitted because of issues such as spectra quality or false discovery rates. This results in an increase of biologically useful data available for interpretation. In summary, PyQuant is a flexible mass spectrometry data quantification platform that is capable of interfacing with a variety of existing formats and is highly customizable, which permits easy configuration for custom analysis.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christopher J.

6b12971f902bf4cf021c1eea6c25abcc5aff7de9,Differential Expression of Immunity Related Genes Can Predict Moderate-Severe Chronic GvHD Early after Myeloablative Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.,"Introduction Chronic graft versus host disease is the major cause of poor outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Clinically significant moderate-severe chronic GvHD (cGvHD) rarely shows a sustained complete response to immunosuppressive drugs and non-responders either die or suffer long-term. Early and accurate prediction of ensuing cGvHD can help identify high risk patients to make preemptive treatment possible. In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed the transcriptome of immunity related genes at one month post-transplant with the aim to identify a potential early and accurate predictor of clinically significant cGvHD. Methods An adult retrospective cohort of 73 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched myeloablative allogeneic HCT recipients were included. All patients received 4.5 mg/kg antithymocyte globulin as GvHD prophylaxis. Diagnosis of cGvHD was based on National Institutes of Health consensus criteria with the median day of diagnosis being 126 days. Total RNA extracted from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells at one month post-transplant was used to run a gene expression CodeSet profiling of 594 immunity related genes including 15 internal reference genes using Nanostring Technology. Benjamini Hochberg procedure was used to calculate the P value and the false discovery rate (FDR) of differentially expressed genes. Results A set of 12 differentially expressed genes with a Benjamini Hochberg P-value (BHP) of 7 in this panel of 12 genes was able identify patients with high risk of developing mod-severe cGVHD with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 88% (AUCâ€¯=â€¯0.88, P Conclusion The robust and rapid technique of Nanostring based transcriptome profiling identified a gene panel consisting of 12 genes for an early prediction of moderate-severe cGVHD (one month) with high sensitivity and specificity. A precision medicine approach of preemptive treatment of cGVHD can be possible using this study leading to improved outcomes of HCT.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Amit Kalra"", ids = ""152949039""); list(name = ""Poonam Dharmani-Khan"", ids = ""1402466832""); list(name = ""Stuti Patel"", ids = ""145059978""); list(name = ""Rehan Mujeeb Faridi"", ids = ""36065275""); list(name = ""Victor Maxwell Lewis"", ids = ""31440395""); list(name = ""Andrew Daly"", ids = ""145302907""); list(name = ""Adnan Mansoor"", ids = ""4626274""); list(name = ""Meerâ\200\220Taher Shabaniâ\200\220Rad"", ids = ""1401398754""); list(name = ""Jan Storek"", ids = ""4556368""); list(name = ""Faisal Khan"", ids = ""31471353"")",0f478e0bbc243dec6794b372158a8e31dda47780,,Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation,25,
4578d7945ec3a90308918c9133a2cff344dea70a,"Globally, unrelated protein sequences appear random","MOTIVATION
To test whether protein folding constraints and secondary structure sequence preferences significantly reduce the space of amino acid words in proteins, we compared the frequencies of four- and five-amino acid word clumps (independent words) in proteins to the frequencies predicted by four random sequence models.


RESULTS
While the human proteome has many overrepresented word clumps, these words come from large protein families with biased compositions (e.g. Zn-fingers). In contrast, in a non-redundant sample of Pfam-AB, only 1% of four-amino acid word clumps (4.7% of 5mer words) are 2-fold overrepresented compared with our simplest random model [MC(0)], and 0.1% (4mers) to 0.5% (5mers) are 2-fold overrepresented compared with a window-shuffled random model. Using a false discovery rate q-value analysis, the number of exceptional four- or five-letter words in real proteins is similar to the number found when comparing words from one random model to another. Consensus overrepresented words are not enriched in conserved regions of proteins, but four-letter words are enriched 1.18- to 1.56-fold in alpha-helical secondary structures (but not beta-strands). Five-residue consensus exceptional words are enriched for alpha-helix 1.43- to 1.61-fold. Protein word preferences in regular secondary structure do not appear to significantly restrict the use of sequence words in unrelated proteins, although the consensus exceptional words have a secondary structure bias for alpha-helix. Globally, words in protein sequences appear to be under very few constraints; for the most part, they appear to be random.

4df0d723fae2da48f48181b907ae16ba6c6233dd,Testing hypotheses about the microbiome using the linear decomposition model (LDM).,"MOTIVATION
Methods for analyzing microbiome data generally fall into one of two groups: tests of the global hypothesis of any microbiome effect, which do not provide any information on the contribution of individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs); and tests for individual OTUs, which do not typically provide a global test of microbiome effect. Without a unified approach, the findings of a global test may be hard to resolve with the findings at the individual OTU level. Further, many tests of individual OTU effects do not preserve the false discovery rate (FDR).


RESULTS
We introduce the linear decomposition model (LDM), that provides a single analysis path that includes global tests of any effect of the microbiome, tests of the effects of individual OTUs while accounting for multiple testing by controlling the FDR, and a connection to distance-based ordination. The LDM accommodates both continuous and discrete variables (e.g., clinical outcomes, environmental factors) as well as interaction terms to be tested either singly or in combination, allows for adjustment of confounding covariates, and uses permutation-based p-values that can control for correlation. The LDM can also be applied to transformed data, and an ""omnibus"" test can easily combine results from analyses conducted on different transformation scales. We also provide a new implementation of PERMANOVA based on our approach. For global testing, our simulations indicate the LDM provided correct type I error and can have comparable power to existing distance-based methods. For testing individual OTUs, our simulations indicate the LDM controlled the FDR well. In contrast, DESeq2 often had inflated FDR; MetagenomeSeq generally had the lowest sensitivity. The flexibility of the LDM for a variety of microbiome studies is illustrated by the analysis of data from two microbiome studies. We also show that our implementation of PERMANOVA can outperform existing implementations.

bbcb03ce531b4c5d209b52309e75edd400508b89,Plasma proteomics reveals markers of metabolic stress in HIV infected children with severe acute malnutrition: call for more evidence-based nutritional intervention strategies,"HIV infection affects up to 30% of children presenting with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Africa and is associated with increased mortality. Children with SAM are treated similarly regardless of the presence of HIV although mechanisms of nutritional recovery in HIV and/or SAM are not well understood. We aimed to test the hypothesis that metabolic and inflammatory perturbations among children with SAM differed between those with HIV (n = 54) and without HIV (n = 113) to better understand their specific nutritional and therapeutic requirements. We performed a secondary analysis of a clinical trial and plasma proteomics data among children with complicated SAM in Kenya and Malawi. Compared to children with SAM without HIV, HIV-infected children had evidence (false discovery rate corrected p<0.05) of metabolic stress, including enriched pathways related to inflammation and lipid metabolism. Moreover, we observed reduced plasma levels of zinc--2-glycoprotrein, butyrylcholinesterase, and increased levels of complement C2 resembling findings in metabolic syndrome, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases. HIV was also associated (false discovery rate corrected p<0.05) with higher levels of plasma chemokines: MCP1, CCL4, GCSF, IL1b, TNFa, IL-2, 5, 7, 8 and 15, IL12p40, IP-10, and IL-1RA. Considering evidence of biomarkers of metabolic stress in children with HIV and SAM, it is of potential concern that our current treatment strategy for SAM regardless of HIV status involves a high-fat therapeutic diet.

Objectives: In order to transfer the paradigms used in fMRI to the more portable EEG technique, this study aims at investigating the possibility to retrieve distinguishable activation patterns during different imagery tasks, by using advanced high resolution EEG methodology in the time and frequency domains. Methods: 61-channels EEG was recorded from 15 healthy volunteers during the execution of three imagery tasks, Playing Tennis (T), Prolonged Grasping (G) and Spatial Navigation in a domestic environment (N), and during Relax (R). EEG traces were projected on a cortical model by solving the electromagnetic linear inverse problem. Power Spectrum Density was computed on cortical waveforms and averaged in four frequency bands (Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma). T-tests for a significance level of 5%, corrected with False Discovery Rate, were performed for T-R, N-R and G-R comparisons and mapped on a cortical model. Results: Statistical maps showed a partial spatial overlapping between cortical areas involved in the execution of the three imagery tasks (T, G, N). However, the specific contribution in different frequency bands (Alpha for the two motor tasks and Beta for the navigation task) allows to separate the imaginative tasks. Conclusions: Results suggest that the high resolution EEG spectral mapping can be an effective way to address the analysis of imaginative functions, allowing to discriminate different mental states without the limitations of the use of an fMRI scanner, with important implications for DOC oriented Brain Computer Interface applications.

We used extensive, empirically driven simulations to explore eQTL study design and the performance of various analysis strategies. Across multiple testing correction methods, false discoveries of genes with eQTLs (eGenes) were substantially inflated when false discovery rate (FDR) control was applied to all tests and only appropriately controlled using hierarchical procedures. All multiple testing correction procedures had low power and inflated FDR for eGenes whose causal SNPs had small allele frequencies using small sample sizes (e.g. frequency <10% in 100 samples), indicating that even moderately low frequency eQTL SNPs (eSNPs) in these studies are enriched for false discoveries. In scenarios with â‰¥80% power, the top eSNP was the true simulated eSNP 90% of the time, but substantially less frequently for very common eSNPs (minor allele frequencies >25%). Overestimation of eQTL effect sizes, so-called 'Winner's Curse', was common in low and moderate power settings. To address this, we developed a bootstrap method (BootstrapQTL) that led to more accurate effect size estimation. These insights provide a foundation for future eQTL studies, especially those with sampling constraints and subtly different conditions.",2018,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qin Qin Huang"", ids = ""18155402""); list(name = ""Scott C.

9dddbcdbcd36ff5951cecf7b83c60f92576639f1,Cancer gene mutations in congenital pulmonary airway malformation patients,"Background
Newborns affected with congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAMs) may present with severe respiratory distress or remain asymptomatic. While surgical resection is the definitive treatment for symptomatic CPAMs, prophylactic elective surgery may be recommended for asymptomatic CPAMs owing to the risk of tumour development. However, the implementation of prophylactic surgery is quite controversial on the grounds that more evidence linking CPAMs and cancer is needed. The large gap in knowledge of CPAM pathogenesis results in uncertainties and controversies in disease management. As developmental genes control postnatal cell growth and contribute to cancer development, we hypothesised that CPAMs may be underlain by germline mutations in genes governing airways development.


Methods
Sequencing of the exome of 19 patients and their unaffected parents.


Results
A more than expected number of mutations in cancer genes (false discovery rate q-value <5.01Ã—10-5) was observed. The co-occurrence, in the same patient, of damaging variants in genes encoding interacting proteins is intriguing, the most striking being thyroglobulin (TG) and its receptor, megalin (LRP2). Both genes are highly relevant in lung development and cancer.


Conclusions
The overall excess of mutations in cancer genes may account for the reported association of CPAMs with carcinomas and provide some evidence to argue for prophylactic surgery by some surgeons.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jacob Shujui Hsu"", ids = ""21225558""); list(name = ""Ruizhong Zhang"", ids = ""2431365""); list(name = ""Fanny G.

Many transcriptomic studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest, such as genes or transcripts. Several different quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that while the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential expression analyses on simple count matrices and transcript-level abundance estimates improve the performance in simulated data, the difference is relatively minor in several real data sets.

2f7fe1b90ebfbdc3a00e68e65bc90af58e4fdeaa,An evaluation of statistical approaches to postmarketing surveillance.,"Safety of medical products presents a serious concern worldwide. Surveillance systems of postmarket medical products have been established for continual monitoring of adverse events (AEs) in many countries, and the proliferation of electronic health record systems further facilitates continual monitoring for AEs. We review existing statistical methods for signal detection that are mostly in use in postmarketing safety surveillance of spontaneously reported AEs and we study their performance characteristics by simulation. We compare those with the likelihood ratio test (LRT) method (appropriately modified for use in pharmacovigilance) and use three different methods to generate data (AE based, drug based, and a modification of the method of Ahmed et al). Performance metrics include type I error, power, sensitivity, and false discovery rate, among others. The results show superior performance of the LRT method in almost all simulation experiments. An application to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database is illustrated using rhabdomyolysis-related preferred terms reported to FDA during the third-quarter of 2014 to the first-quarter of 2017 for statin drugs. We present a critical discussion and recommendations for use of these methods.",2020,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yuxin Ding"", ids = ""1480956440""); list(name = ""Marianthi Markatou"", ids = ""1806164""); list(name = ""Robert Ball"", ids = ""152532981"")",,,Statistics in medicine,,
4e9f93899675df66665e532475061cf85b37e0ae,P13.11 Spatio-temporal discrimination of cortical activities involved in complex imagery tasks: a study of high resolution EEG,"Introduction: Recent fMRI studies (Owen et al, Science, 2006; Monti et al, NEJM 2010) showed the possibility to use the voluntary modulation of mental states for detecting the residual level of awareness in patients with Disorders of Consciousness (DOC) and for implementing tools for binary communication. Objectives: In order to transfer the paradigms used in fMRI to the more portable EEG technique, this study aims at investigating the possibility to retrieve distinguishable activation patterns during different imagery tasks, by using advanced high resolution EEG methodology in the time and frequency domains. Methods: 61-channels EEG was recorded from 15 healthy volunteers during the execution of three imagery tasks, Playing Tennis (T), Prolonged Grasping (G) and Spatial Navigation in a domestic environment (N), and during Relax (R). EEG traces were projected on a cortical model by solving the electromagnetic linear inverse problem. Power Spectrum Density was computed on cortical waveforms and averaged in four frequency bands (Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma). T-tests for a significance level of 5%, corrected with False Discovery Rate, were performed for T-R, N-R and G-R comparisons and mapped on a cortical model. Results: Statistical maps showed a partial spatial overlapping between cortical areas involved in the execution of the three imagery tasks (T, G, N). However, the specific contribution in different frequency bands (Alpha for the two motor tasks and Beta for the navigation task) allows to separate the imaginative tasks. Conclusions: Results suggest that the high resolution EEG spectral mapping can be an effective way to address the analysis of imaginative functions, allowing to discriminate different mental states without the limitations of the use of an fMRI scanner, with important implications for DOC oriented Brain Computer Interface applications.

This is the first in-depth diffusion imaging study to investigate the rich club along with other organizational changes in the brain's anatomical network in behavioral frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and a matched cohort with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). Our study sheds light on how bvFTD and EOAD affect connectivity of white matter fiber pathways in the brain, revealing differences and commonalities in the connectome among the dementias. To analyze the breakdown in connectivity, we studied three groups: 20 bvFTD, 23 EOAD, and 37 healthy elderly controls. All participants were scanned with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and based on whole-brain probabilistic tractography and cortical parcellations, we analyzed the rich club of the brain's connectivity network. This revealed distinct patterns of disruption in both forms of dementia. In the connectome, we detected less disruption overall in EOAD than in bvFTD [false discovery rate (FDR) critical Pperm â€‰=â€‰5.7 Ã— 10(-3) , 10,000 permutations], with more involvement of richly interconnected areas of the brain (chi-squared Pâ€‰=â€‰1.4 Ã— 10(-4) )-predominantly posterior cognitive alterations. In bvFTD, we found a greater spread of disruption including the rich club (FDR critical Pperm â€‰=â€‰6 Ã— 10(-4) ), but especially more peripheral alterations (chi-squared Pâ€‰=â€‰6.5 Ã— 10(-3) ), particularly in medial frontal areas of the brain, in line with the known behavioral socioemotional deficits seen in these patients.",2016,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Madelaine Daianu"", ids = ""1822346""); list(name = ""Adam Mezher"", ids = ""2809876""); list(name = ""Mario F.

1d00d3fea6a0d76a48fd6dc27095ff7e9545b33d,Gene Expression Profiles in Parkinson Disease Prefrontal Cortex Implicate FOXO1 and Genes under Its Transcriptional Regulation,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with largely unknown genetic mechanisms. While the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD mainly takes place in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) region, other brain areas, including the prefrontal cortex, develop Lewy bodies, the neuropathological hallmark of PD. We generated and analyzed expression data from the prefrontal cortex Brodmann Area 9 (BA9) of 27 PD and 26 control samples using the 44K One-Color Agilent 60-mer Whole Human Genome Microarray. All samples were male, without significant Alzheimer disease pathology and with extensive pathological annotation available. 507 of the 39,122 analyzed expression probes were different between PD and control samples at false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. One of the genes with significantly increased expression in PD was the forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) transcription factor. Notably, genes carrying the FoxO1 binding site were significantly enriched in the FDR-significant group of genes (177 genes covered by 189 probes), suggesting a role for FoxO1 upstream of the observed expression changes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from a recent meta-analysis of PD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were successfully genotyped in 50 out of the 53 microarray brains, allowing a targeted expression-SNP (eSNP) analysis for 52 SNPs associated with PD affection at genome-wide significance and the 189 probes from FoxO1 regulated genes. A significant association was observed between a SNP in the cyclin G associated kinase (GAK) gene and a probe in the spermine oxidase (SMOX) gene. Further examination of the FOXO1 region in a meta-analysis of six available GWAS showed two SNPs significantly associated with age at onset of PD. These results implicate FOXO1 as a PD-relevant gene and warrant further functional analyses of its transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexandra Dumitriu"", ids = ""1802559""); list(name = ""Jeanne Latourelle"", ids = ""2582377""); list(name = ""Tiffany C.

The high glucose level induce disturbance of neurovascular (NV) coupling is suggested to be one potential mechanism, however, the neuroimaging evidence is still lacking. To assess the NV decoupling pattern in early diabetic status, 33 T2DM without MCI patients and 33 healthy control subjects were prospectively enrolled. Then, they underwent resting state functional MRI and arterial spin labeling imaging to explore the hub-based networks and to estimate the coupling of voxel-wise cerebral blood flow (CBF)-degree centrality (DC), CBF-mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF) and CBF- mean regional homogeneity (mReHo). We further evaluated the relationship between NV coupling pattern and cognitive performance (false discovery rate corrected). T2DM without MCI patients displayed significant decrease in the absolute CBF-mALFF, CBF-mReHo coupling of CBFnetwork and in the CBF-DC coupling of DCnetwork. Besides, networks which involved CBF and DC hubs mainly located in the default mode network (DMN). Furthermore, less severe disease and better cognitive performance in T2DM patients were significantly correlated with higher coupling of CBF-DC, CBF-mALFF or CBF-mReHo, especially for the cognitive dimensions of general function and executive function. Thus, coupling of CBF-DC, CBF-mALFF and CBF-mReHo may serve as promising indicators to reflect NV coupling state and to explain the T2DM related early cognitive impairment.",2019,Computer Science; Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ying Yu"", ids = ""50134125""); list(name = ""Lin-Feng Yan"", ids = ""3566103""); list(name = ""Qian Sun"", ids = ""32701443""); list(name = ""Bo Hu"", ids = ""144980853""); list(name = ""Jin Zhang"", ids = ""48180876""); list(name = ""Yang Yang"", ids = ""1708973""); list(name = ""Yu-jie Dai"", ids = ""153883479""); list(name = ""Wu-Xun Cui"", ids = ""152297010""); list(name = ""Si-Jie Xiu"", ids = ""152566544""); list(name = ""Yu-Chuan Hu"", ids = ""115512293""); list(name = ""Chun-Ni Heng"", ids = ""116810113""); list(name = ""Qing-Quan Liu"", ids = ""29215403""); list(name = ""Jun-Feng Hou"", ids = ""7287272""); list(name = ""Yu-Yun Pan"", ids = ""32649558""); list(name = ""Liang-Hao Zhai"", ids = ""152124783""); list(name = ""Teng-Hui Han"", ids = ""152178766""); list(name = ""Guang-Bin Cui"", ids = ""2838008""); list(name = ""Wen-Ping Wang"", ids = ""49336607"")",,,NeuroImage,200,644-658
58bf9433ba9a87f5629c7b2a2cb7d3982cfd81f9,Fdr Control in Multiple Testing under Non-normality,"There is a growing literature on the large-scale multiple testing in which the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure and its variants play a key role. Almost all this work assumes that the underlying distribution is normal in calculating the p-values. Here we study the effect of non-normality on false discovery control in large-scale multiple testing. The normal approximation, bootstrap calibration and the skewness-corrected normal approximation methods of approximating the individual p-values used to rank the significance levels are investigated. As an illustration, we compare these procedures with the BH method in terms of the cutting threshold and the false discovery rate.",2015,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Bing-Yi Jing"", ids = ""40528386""); list(name = ""Xin-bing Kong"", ids = ""103638873""); list(name = ""Wang Zhou"", ids = ""9313767"")",b30ef6d39c299568d63d5b14a17183fbde643964,059ff4ea91c577fff7f8de127ea09d8912aa7ef2; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; 704da3da896109ead61d36bc0510368a3797b6d0; 2c4c300672ea8634f4714432cbd54d9f3f9d37b4; 918f6216cf0c7e95825737fdef804cba610d0785; 5f74a100aba4416bb701c184b3d636af07df6ce1; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 7ddc4808dc504dbb84286f2bee6d2e43f88bc96e; 5e147ca57ea8ba09c571abc2fb75a02724c1b611; e9cddd8d7c37989539e6c6bad14db3d488441ea5; d0520f11b55392c010fa048e3186b7512ef9e9e9; 2888f87e01c7adfd95f02c52339a7db8ad329677; aced86a6933b6259ddc1ef6879231f5d370510a8; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 2f6e38627c8f1ddd95f5e17f07253e5ac37f3312; eab669a51f7a7321092998cc79150d306d708647; 75b0d953ebcd84c493c71f89e6903c42571c15d1; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 6e54dcd54cec46d1d006bc79e3ea455aa9dc00b6,Statistica Sinica,24,1879
fbb1c0323ab9e1e00fe486350aa6984c4bf82028,Exploring Genetic Variation that Influences Brain Methylation in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Epigenetics is crucial to lasting changes in gene expression in the brain. Recent studies suggest a role for DNA methylation in ADHD. We explored the contribution to ADHD of allele-specific methylation (ASM), an epigenetic mechanism that involves SNPs correlating with differential levels of DNA methylation at CpG sites. We selected 3,896 tagSNPs reported to influence methylation in human brain regions and performed a case-control association study using the summary statistics from the largest GWAS meta-analysis of ADHD, comprising 20,183 cases and 35,191 controls. We identified associations with eight tagSNPs that were significant at a 5% False Discovery Rate (FDR). These SNPs correlated with methylation of CpG sites lying in the promoter regions of six genes. Since methylation may affect gene expression, we inspected these ASM SNPs together with 52 ASM SNPs in high LD with them for eQTLs in brain tissues and observed that the expression of three of those genes was affected by them. ADHD risk alleles correlated with increased expression (and decreased methylation) of ARTN and PIDD1 and with a decreased expression (and increased methylation) of C2orf82. Furthermore, these three genes were predicted to have altered expression in ADHD, and genetic variants in C2orf82 correlated with brain volumes.

759fea63ce71040018d4baf028953b96b7328c52,Monocytes of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia show alterations in cholesterol metabolism,"BackgroundElevated plasma cholesterol promotes the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in which monocyte-derived lipid-laden macrophages are frequently found. To analyze, if circulating monocytes already show increased lipid content and differences in lipoprotein metabolism, we compared monocytes from patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) with those from healthy individuals.MethodsCholesterol and oxidized cholesterol metabolite serum levels of FH and of healthy, gender/age matched control subjects were measured by combined gas chromatography â€“ mass spectroscopy. Monocytes from patients with FH and from healthy subjects were isolated by antibody-assisted density centrifugation. Gene expression profiles of isolated monocytes were measured using Affymetrix HG-U 133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. We compared monocyte gene expression profiles from FH patients with healthy controls using a Welch T-test with correction for multiple testing (p < 0.05; Benjamini Hochberg correction, False Discovery Rate = 0.05). The differential expression of FH associated genes was validated at the mRNA level by qRT-PCR and/or at the protein level by Western Blot or flow cytometry. Functional validation of monocyte scavenger receptor activities were done by binding assays and dose/time dependent uptake analysis using native and oxidized LDL.ResultsUsing microarray analysis we found in FH patients a significant up-regulation of 1,617 genes and a down-regulation of 701 genes compared to monocytes from healthy individuals. These include genes of proteins that are involved in the uptake, biosynthesis, disposition, and cellular efflux of cholesterol. In addition, plasma from FH patients contains elevated amounts of sterols and oxysterols. An increased uptake of oxidized as well as of native LDL by FH monocytes combined with a down-regulation of NPC1 and ABCA1 explains the lipid accumulation observed in these cells.ConclusionOur data demonstrate that circulating FH monocytes show differences in cell physiology that may contribute to the early onset of atherosclerosis in this disease.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sandy Mosig"", ids = ""6949451""); list(name = ""Knut Rennert"", ids = ""3224918""); list(name = ""Petra Buettner"", ids = ""47749903""); list(name = ""Siegfried Dr Krause"", ids = ""144349831""); list(name = ""Dieter LÃ¼tjohann"", ids = ""3043033""); list(name = ""Muhidien Soufi"", ids = ""6469426""); list(name = ""Regine Heller"", ids = ""145161266""); list(name = ""Harald Funke"", ids = ""47014614"")",8ea295261a8701917c5caae4b251192906ddcd34; 25233c9c6c4877fb8217ab8767208af3171ebb52; a0a868cc7a66e9841eb7110bdf789a7892932e1e; e0dab4277e390c45cb7858ced6ae54d45f2f906b; be72591dd4613f56d0732bff3d1b993d2b36bdfa; a1f64c593d4e05270cef71f851109310d38037f8; f37645d9fca75b4e2a6b0e310e54aff1aeab34c2; 832560f3895ea18d4a76524ccbc4daacb15b3190; 7b79a5556b7827011ee73565519523f1a6e8c290; 97717d65efd9f6c2370184d54acd2361e52247dd; 583aad02832879e573e905dfa4524799bef4c0f0; 19fecd00f346af8720826a8aec973c436aa251c1; 5799b2af8137ebf6f0268e8b723150ccd04d517a; cf1b849b2e6238f90356d35e9870bcda3230f826; c2835189f9d323844e13facad91be26b0bdb584f; ee44b50634920f647997a3216d9d30667d653460; 74b1b962bc2434d88e54bd390bca93f1b5ca8773; 6e4029d90a6f25c983dcb0e35c6654bb659661e2; 440c343df3f53f9f89fb95b523bc72ab6f30892d; 2ec71c95eb9f5b28a6ddfd356299ba6e71d0ef1a; 4e8e2fc03589c99e8c38b92b1cdb60ebce1019d1; 1d6a0aa9f1071f72ad43bfb870ae574d9c71a137; 65d9cd31a7bc4057531867c80760976bbd28e2e9; dc2d781eb9bbcc1c65d8e10f00fec7fa7f88de92; e9dc09b22ee1b7009916091b9a2d11a464a7cf8f; 0454e05e69e3b3dba1cb5374604eb6ef5aa53a9f; b221975c44173fbcb390d9e4624d56d5d6b8253f; 7e9bca465bba8758fe84e8c2c58b2615bb1bd30b; 155875ec9b4e8d5d128730809ce723c800a07f9d; 1f3b035216a6132dbfb55c0af8c278c644a584bd; 8046a2d3e266bd24504a14eb7311d0a1c9cc154d; 67b6ea3f11b689fd6265252354e9bf7b52fc8665; d55e705c6d3804e297a05b6f15b26ec62ef6284b; 966abe8f759d156fc62ce58179becad45fb003fa; cc2c544e705e896534dbfeefaa18f19d52baad9e; c91fafd03dfcfc3ba9b621bba177fa1f20fa9711; 0d1448dbed0b123a78907316826d116ad97cfbcf; 114f2940c7ac7eaa364f2d86234a1f28cce6a49a; 245fa53a1756eea46618c5fbf76342dce4e261ab; a22ad0c2f474b1597f9ca5501181439ebc2fb734; 475266b02d9d5477f384cd6f67c4da9dfec38936; 3c8ee9ea67e21d3ef0d6d4e4a9978d46899affc1,a06ce5da60f91a1e3d75479b854429ea73d101a8; 36aa359a4b24002f620449ffa0d1f9dde53a4b50; 5b9b6d312b47bc3433868636da8796b2233989be; 56d65899a78617e6eb8217cfd6effd78e2109a5e; 0eb6671a40a9041250337e5e00c3e0f367d8370f; 577df01db790ad62ffaead20059adef1c28467d6; 405050999ca860995af811c4c4c011abcb01d9f5; 6493022ce58caa6f8e06bc38c5f61a27f2db8db9; f755bb8a3c099c8c872e409463453e93a73c00b0; ddafc72200a9f391f78a025264b748d3193049dd; 28381854e5c1bba9d601e98b0baf7b7f108e62d0; c0bdd7a8179707a2ad8cfb6159c4f2b299efb40c; c91290bd60e10db64c84fec914210d37e9cf77e8; 522292eb967d902d110e52880343cdb5f3964176; 30b595cf82a88b0bfd2fcead7efc9dfb8e6192e1; cb7de33b2283110f4b574f05f38170cc80ecd978; 7adef790bb96cb4052bce3918b795982be5248a8; 188f4c73c85063d84f47d397ec569e27588c35f0; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; f610acd15f1594f629a8e2ad892a4ff244ef0524; 4b4b5631b8075972b43d35acdcccfed2781fb7af; 713c7a52c23b779209cd8f3aed70bf5adda0e266; f7db28c8e3c732dd65efa5eba2be6d6edc9f6ae4; ec3ab8e791284de05dfae16fc2cddd91c130ecd6; ec97865a68a3ebc78f6783599aebd8939a788baf; aa033da5ebeae49394bf72af67b3fb4fe93517b8; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; b6ce41f607faf92c5b54a02d21beef1901c5eec5; 3da87db5976266729108d2e45f6f81b8bf441974; 5c440abe5e9fc2e8c546301f97893999e49c2fa5; 573563f780dd06764d24825c64d9ec426102cb34,BMC Medical Genomics,1,60 - 60
6be22dab1cedf4e9d421ce6371ede3af69e0d87b,Beyond target-decoy competition: stable validation of peptide and protein identifications in mass spectrometry-based discovery proteomics,"In bottom-up discovery proteomics, target-decoy competition (TDC) is the most popular method for false discovery rate (FDR) control. Despite unquestionable statistical foundations, this method has drawbacks, including its hitherto unknown intrinsic lack of stability vis-Ã -vis practical conditions of application. Although some consequences of this instability have already been empirically described, they may have been misinterpreted. This article provides evidence that TDC has become less reliable as the accuracy of modern mass spectrometers improved. We therefore propose to replace TDC by a totally different method to control the FDR at spectrum, peptide and protein levels, while benefiting from the theoretical guarantees of the Benjamini-Hochberg framework. As this method is simpler to use, faster to compute and more stable than TDC, we argue that it is better adapted to the standardization and throughput constraints of current proteomic platforms.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Yohann CoutÃ©"", ids = ""4830279""); list(name = ""Christophe Bruley"", ids = ""2144813""); list(name = ""Thomas Burger"", ids = ""50257057"")",999c47ce6dba6cb55550d7b04e0deeb531ea24aa,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 987718b23ff0c27c0cd99702ede5bbfd52b2ee93; 65477c1272f17e62428be588f1caa6379084dc50; 84578ee8c68ecdfab7c0f85bfd5e576b5b20347c; 6515e1c42fd9cdbf83ad7d91bf1ee7c8e98e551b; 4a7bc5481186299e532137c35e35cf2319aca6e1; 948fd800ecdd3c99488dde36b41480ca1b8acce3; cf24c819d5bb518bdce05aca32a2d42aa2cc99b7; d6d07d073e9fdbd23219bc3aa99dbb5b7ba6933c; 560463880942d2ec1b760ec386d8c0c7c6cd8dbe; 1ef83b2b980b406db708adb6104533be05af9854; 067c511443cadcbdf8efbf5ae76fc664020d3442; 16d6ddb6f5fd9c076bb945af4c8d2afa318f6cff; 8691f15e7692acf197fdf14f621d176b22e79338; 8ee8373dc5edca019a9e8cf934891e9cad105eb2; 3b3384926168e7af70d71e65073088024e28278f; 8fde4e634e968019018732c3857699a22feb021d; 4fac2f001ada8e72fffd4c48499785f3ddc1c6ac; 6b95688911ddd39393320a260ab39df5e8d64326; 3d3b2a4f1ae4e029a43c22171cb61f3c56516d72; 28a215515d10b0ccadef846c61894e2e8a4ff65a; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; c733796b3c3244eb43927031997e88fefdec3522; bdf941b1af86214a11872936138db1a4a9b65893; 6cba8b457ea7520357ade5d24d393004d36765f6; d038d7acea15ed1a4454ed47f53da7135415b8a4; 4ef64634f351d31f51e5c4bc9855b11e6248934c; ea6c85fb540e426b6600fc61fdd46ce8b981ee5d; afcf883c8e4d1f97a6325b15cc6401d0b8c44656; 44d86f3ba9167f4931dae729d814c13fbc7a0efb; e01ba39a9df8338dac8b7ab877facce3ae3654c9; 3213793dc120ef6583f71125c0e92e323471d0bc; 473b41b81b942ba295d40d34103e3c8e6eb83416; e45a8d7176bd738c1e63de1f6791a88e704f8b4b; 84bf48112cac6b9fa7ad8fc4650b556abf7d13ab; 1a949ee66b7ce451b560d2b08df0691d2d008f65; 742043bf29ee082aad27713d3b21a82f8562f485; 958005b26767ea3c2661487222758a1eac162331; 397d848fa31801e2aab69202ae5b2483876f0031; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 0333223dd7a1c5fa823cc5e94c24da6dae6bf94c; fa2c24e3d706b03a73405afdb9025dbb5918fdd2; e713aebcad8975ab52d2ce6f70ee7d891ca89b01; 0a3529cd03ed73f8cb570e94634475b6f323f228; 80e4ea208e8292336ad4a6b040a754d21525f110; a034faac961322df9798139731ff0111c5c543bf; f55781157f01ccb07242080a59d4364829d73323; 3d744cf9d758aa51e47a946af4447daf26cec1d6; cedda598732ea3c959cc5bc6a596c1b303c5c54b; 618b5a37d239017decfc75b5f0435cc444b48d2a; 4f133a62ee41fef10135a8b1c4a95c291fdf7dd4; 192aa8f561360c1078981cc8cec4cb809b940515,bioRxiv,,
7c8ab4825e0d59ab38c0790a8ca7ee81edfe9e4b,On stepdown control of the false discovery proportion,"Consider the problem of testing multiple null hypotheses. A clas- sical approach to dealing with the multiplicity problem is to restrict attention to procedures that control the familywise error rate (FWER), the probabil- ity of even one false rejection. However, if s is large, control of the FWER is so stringent that the ability of a procedure which controls the FWER to detect false null hypotheses is limited. Consequently, it is desirable to consider other measures of error control. We will consider methods based on control of the false discovery proportion (FDP) defined by the number of false rejec- tions divided by the total number of rejections (defined to be 0 if there are no rejections). The false discovery rate proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) controls E(FDP). Here, we construct methods such that, for any and ï¿½, P {FDP > } â‰¤ ï¿½. Based on p-values of individual tests, we consider stepdown procedures that control the FDP, without imposing dependence as- sumptions on the joint distribution of the p-values. A greatly improved version of a method given in Lehmann and Romano (10) is derived and generalized to provide a means by which any sequence of nondecreasing constants can be rescaled to ensure control of the FDP. We also provide a stepdown procedure that controls the FDR under a dependence assumption.",2006,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Joseph P. Romano"", ids = ""2152560""); list(name = ""Azeem M.

5a386053a9a8affd4b4c17b8f7738322202ebcaa,Assessing Differential Expression in Two-Color Microarrays: A Resampling-Based Empirical Bayes Approach,"Microarrays are widely used for examining differential gene expression, identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms, and detecting methylation loci. Multiple testing methods in microarray data analysis aim at controlling both Type I and Type II error rates; however, real microarray data do not always fit their distribution assumptions. Smyth's ubiquitous parametric method, for example, inadequately accommodates violations of normality assumptions, resulting in inflated Type I error rates. The Significance Analysis of Microarrays, another widely used microarray data analysis method, is based on a permutation test and is robust to non-normally distributed data; however, the Significance Analysis of Microarrays method fold change criteria are problematic, and can critically alter the conclusion of a study, as a result of compositional changes of the control data set in the analysis. We propose a novel approach, combining resampling with empirical Bayes methods: the Resampling-based empirical Bayes Methods. This approach not only reduces false discovery rates for non-normally distributed microarray data, but it is also impervious to fold change threshold since no control data set selection is needed. Through simulation studies, sensitivities, specificities, total rejections, and false discovery rates are compared across the Smyth's parametric method, the Significance Analysis of Microarrays, and the Resampling-based empirical Bayes Methods. Differences in false discovery rates controls between each approach are illustrated through a preterm delivery methylation study. The results show that the Resampling-based empirical Bayes Methods offer significantly higher specificity and lower false discovery rates compared to Smyth's parametric method when data are not normally distributed. The Resampling-based empirical Bayes Methods also offers higher statistical power than the Significance Analysis of Microarrays method when the proportion of significantly differentially expressed genes is large for both normally and non-normally distributed data. Finally, the Resampling-based empirical Bayes Methods are generalizable to next generation sequencing RNA-seq data analysis.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Dongmei Li"", ids = ""1764239""); list(name = ""Marc A.

cf642cd4788fd30be7ca0fddd52ec8d86174dd56,Quantitative temporal proteomic analysis of human embryonic stem cell differentiation into oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.,"Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are glial cells of the central nervous system, which produce myelin. Cultured OLs provide immense therapeutic opportunities for treating a variety of neurological conditions. One of the most promising sources for such therapies is human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as well as providing a model to study human OL development. For these purposes, an investigation of proteome level changes is critical for understanding the process of OL differentiation. In this report, an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach was used to study multiple steps during OL differentiation including neural progenitor cells, glial progenitor cells and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) compared to undifferentiated ESCs. Using a 1% false discovery rate cutoff, âˆ¼3145 proteins were quantitated and several demonstrated progressive stage-specific expression. Proteins such as transferrin, neural cell adhesion molecule 1, apolipoprotein E and wingless-related MMTV integration site 5A showed increased expression from the neural progenitor cell to the OPC stage. Several proteins that have demonstrated evidence or been suspected in OL maturation were also found upregulated in OPCs including fatty acid-binding protein 4, THBS1, bone morphogenetic protein 1, CRYAB, transferrin, tenascin C, COL3A1, TGFBI and EPB41L3. Thus, by providing the first extensive proteomic profiling of human ESC differentiation into OPCs, this study provides many novel proteins that are potentially involved in OL development.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Raghothama Chaerkady"", ids = ""2474326""); list(name = ""Brian S.

A Reply","Andrikogiannopoulou and Papakonstantinou (AP; 2019) conduct an inquiry into the bias of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) estimators of Barras, Scaillet, and Wermers (BSW; 2010). In this Reply, we replicate their results, then further explore the bias issue by (i) using different parameter values, and (ii) updating the sample period. Over the original period (1975-2006), we show how reasonable adjustments to the parameter choices made by BSW and AP results in a sizeable reduction in the bias relative to AP. Over the updated period (1975-2018), we further show that the performance of the FDR improves dramatically across a large range of parameter values. Specifically, we find that the probability of misclassifying a fund with a true alpha of 2% per year is 32% (versus 65% in AP). Our results, in combination with those of AP, indicate that the use of the FDR in finance should be accompanied by a careful evaluation of the underlying data generating process, especially when the sample size is small.",2020,Economics,"list(name = ""Laurent Barras"", ids = ""12055585""); list(name = ""Olivier Scaillet"", ids = ""2482938""); list(name = ""Russ Wermers"", ids = ""3173841"")",,,Journal of Finance,,48
564daeb089071a7cbcbbd56887d216ba122bc950,The Use of Metabolomics to Identify Biological Signatures of Manganese Exposure,"Objectives
Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxicant, and given its health effects and ubiquitous nature in metal-working settings, identification of a valid and reproducible biomarker of Mn exposure is of interest. Here, global metabolomics is utilized to determine metabolites that differ between groups defined by Mn exposure status, with the goal being to help inform a potential metabolite biomarker of Mn exposure.


Methods
Mn exposed subjects were recruited from a Mn steel foundry and Mn unexposed subjects were recruited from crane operators at a metal recycling facility. Over the course of a work day, each subject wore a personal inhalable dust sampler (IOM), and provided an end of shift urine sample that underwent global metabolomics profiling. Both exposed and unexposed subjects were divided into a training set and demographically similar validation set. Using a two-sided adjusted t-test, relative abundances of all metabolites found were compared between Mn exposed and unexposed training sets, and those with a false discovery rates (FDR) <0.1 were further tested in the validation sets.


Results
Fifteen ions were found to be significantly different (FDR < 0.1) between the exposed and unexposed training sets, and nine of these ions remained significantly different between the exposed and unexposed validation set as well. When further dividing exposure status into 'lower exposure' and 'higher exposure', several of these nine ions exhibited an apparent exposure-response relationship.


Conclusions
This is the first time that metabolomics has been used to distinguish between Mn exposure status in an occupational cohort, though additional work should be done to replicate these findings with a larger cohort. With metabolite identification by name, empirical formula, or pathway, a better understanding of the relationship between Mn exposure and neurotoxic effects could be elucidated, and a potential metabolite biomarker of Mn exposure could be determined.",2017,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Marissa G Baker"", ids = ""32620026""); list(name = ""Christopher David Simpson"", ids = ""3044082""); list(name = ""Yvonne S.

92d93ba1a5b9269428f096eb0cdaad1edd7615f5,Mining the Stiffness-Sensitive Transcriptome in Human Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells Identifies Long Noncoding RNA Stiffness Regulators,"Objectiveâ€” Vascular extracellular matrix stiffening is a risk factor for aortic and coronary artery disease. How matrix stiffening regulates the transcriptome profile of human aortic and coronary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is not well understood. Furthermore, the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the cellular response to stiffening has never been explored. This study characterizes the stiffness-sensitive (SS) transcriptome of human aortic and coronary VSMCs and identifies potential key lncRNA regulators of stiffness-dependent VSMC functions. Approach and Resultsâ€” Aortic and coronary VSMCs were cultured on hydrogel substrates mimicking physiological and pathological extracellular matrix stiffness. Total RNAseq was performed to compare the SS transcriptome profiles of aortic and coronary VSMCs. We identified 3098 genes (2842 protein coding and 157 lncRNA) that were stiffness sensitive in both aortic and coronary VSMCs (false discovery rate <1%). Hierarchical clustering revealed that aortic and coronary VSMCs grouped by stiffness rather than cell origin. Conservation analyses also revealed that SS genes were more conserved than stiffness-insensitive genes. These VSMC SS genes were less tissue-type specific and expressed in more tissues than stiffness-insensitive genes. Using unbiased systems analyses, we identified MALAT1 as an SS lncRNA that regulates stiffness-dependent VSMC proliferation and migration in vitro and in vivo. Conclusionsâ€” This study provides the transcriptomic landscape of human aortic and coronary VSMCs in response to extracellular matrix stiffness and identifies novel SS human lncRNAs. Our data suggest that the SS transcriptome is evolutionarily important to VSMCs function and that SS lncRNAs can act as regulators of stiffness-dependent phenotypes.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christopher Yu"", ids = ""48267174""); list(name = ""Tina Xu"", ids = ""36048284""); list(name = ""Richard K.

c1e34e841a97f7fcc717e0f9af101f74393435f1,TMT-based proteomics analysis reveals the protective effect of Xuefu Zhuyu decoction on traumatic brain injury.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE
Xuefu Zhuyu decoction (XFZYD) is a traditional Chinese herbal prescription. It is effective in treating traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear.


AIM OF THE STUDY
This study aimed to reveal the possible mechanisms of XFZYD in treating acute TBI through proteomic clues.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Controlled Cortical Impact (CCI) rats were gavaged with XFZYD (9â€¯g/kg/d) or distilled water (equal volume) for three days. The Modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS), brain water content, HE staining, Nissl staining and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess the effects of XFZYD in treating TBI. Additionally, Tandem mass tag-based (TMT) quantitative proteomics technology was applied to detect proteins of the extracted brain cortex. Bioinformatics analysis including Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were used to analysis differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Bioinformatics Analysis Tool for Molecular mechanism of TCM (BATMAN-TCM) was applied to anchore diseases and pathways of XFZYD. Besides, western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to verify related proteins.


RESULTS
XFZYD improved neurologic function, reduced encephaledema and ameliorated cell morphology around the injured area in CCI rats. A total of 6099 proteins were identified with FDR (false discovery rate)â€¯<â€¯1%. 105 overlapping DEPs were identified (295 DEPs and 804 DEPs in CCI/Sham or XFZYD/CCI group respectively). Of these DEPs, 17 were regulated by XFZYD. Bioinformatics analysis showed the 17 DEPs were predominantly related to platelet activation and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. PLG and CD34 were verified with molecular biotechnology.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study suggests that XFZYD may exert therapeutic effects through multi-pathways regulation in the treatment of TBI. This work may provide proteomics clues for the continuation researches on XFZYD in treating TBI.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dan Zhou"", ids = ""47895897""); list(name = ""Jiamiao Liu"", ids = ""91265569""); list(name = ""Yang Hang"", ids = ""36034881""); list(name = ""Teng Li"", ids = ""144799997""); list(name = ""Pengfei Li"", ids = ""47470919""); list(name = ""ShiChao Guo"", ids = ""1637797904""); list(name = ""Tao Liu"", ids = ""87723693""); list(name = ""Zi-An Xia"", ids = ""153127687""); list(name = ""Yang Wang"", ids = list())",,,Journal of ethnopharmacology,,"

c062d5bede1d50fb3dfaa183e3fb191d243efee9,Body mass index in relation to extracellular vesicle-linked microRNAs in human follicular fluid.,"OBJECTIVE
To study whether increased body mass index is associated with altered expression of extracellular vesicle microRNAs (EV-linked miRNAs) in human follicular fluid.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study.


SETTING
Tertiary-care university-affiliated center.


PATIENT(S)
One hundred thirty-three women undergoing inÂ vitro fertilization (IVF) were recruited from January 2014 to AugustÂ 2016.


INTERVENTIONS(S)
None.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)
EV-linked miRNAs were isolated from follicular fluid and their expression profiles were measured with the use of the Taqman Open Array Human miRNA panel. EV-linked miRNAs were globally normalized and inverse-normal transformed. Associations between body mass index (BMI) and EV-linked miRNA outcomes were analyzed by means of multivariate linear regression and principal component analysis.


RESULT(S)
Eighteen EV-linked miRNAs were associated with an increase in BMI after adjusting for age, ethnicity, smoking status, and batch effects. Hsa-miR-328 remained significant after false discovery rate adjustments. Principal component analyses identified the first principal component to account for 40% of the variation in our EV-linked miRNA dataset, and adjusted linear regression found that the first principal component was significantly associated with BMI after multiple testing adjustments. Using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses, we predicted gene targets of EV-linked miRNA in silico and identified PI3K-Akt signaling, ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, FoxO signaling, and oocyte meiosis pathways.


CONCLUSION(S)
These results show that a 1-unit increase in BMI is associated with altered follicular fluid expression of EV-linked miRNAs that may influence follicular and oocyte developmental pathways. Our findings provide potential insight into a mechanistic explanation for the reduced fertility rates associated with increased BMI.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rosie M.

d93c1bda082e5c203f686fa2fc910a8bcd73a739,Circadian clock pathway genes associated with colorectal cancer risk and prognosis,"Circadian clock genes influence biological processes and may be involved in tumorigenesis. We systematically evaluated genetic variants in the circadian clock pathway genes associated with colorectal cancer risk and survival. We evaluated the association of 119 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 27 circadian clock pathway genes with the risk of colorectal cancer in a caseâ€“control study (1150 cases and 1342 controls). The false discovery rate (FDR) method was applied to correct for multiple comparisons. Gene-based analysis was performed by the sequence kernel association test (SKAT). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the effects of SNPs on the overall survival of patients. We identified that compared to those with the G allele, individuals with the rs76436997 A allele in RORA had a significant 1.33-fold increased risk of colorectal cancer (Pâ€‰=â€‰3.83â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’â€‰4). Specifically, the GA/AA genotypes were related to an enhanced risk of colorectal cancer compared with that associated with the GG genotype, which was more common in patients with well and moderately differentiated tumors and Dukes A/B stages. The SNP rs76436997 significantly increased the overall survival time of colorectal cancer patients (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.044). Furthermore, RNA-seq data showed that the mRNA levels of RORA were significantly lower in colorectal tumors than the paired normal tissues. Gene-based analysis revealed a significant association between RORA and colorectal cancer risk. These findings highlight the important roles of genetic variations in circadian clock pathway genes play in colorectal cancer risk and suggest that RORA is potentially related to colorectal carcinogenesis.",2018,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dongying Gu"", ids = ""145363446""); list(name = ""Shuwei Li"", ids = ""47319239""); list(name = ""Shuai Ben"", ids = ""4140059""); list(name = ""Mulong Du"", ids = ""47571232""); list(name = ""Haiyan Chu"", ids = ""2063143""); list(name = ""Zhengdong Zhang"", ids = ""48805746""); list(name = ""Meilin Wang"", ids = ""48958490""); list(name = ""Zuo-feng Zhang"", ids = ""47294680""); list(name = ""Jinfei Chen"", ids = ""47740275"")",f0484b3e7dc58910aa801ff7188920c08ce38066; 675a58e4a105e950a5d756722260d6b25e7ababf; b061687c2437b8b3228b7a92a9e4f257c1d71eeb; 959698f148fe6b0fa15bc2af4d9e13710624c318,90e0ae887cfd2dd0ada52f78195345099d0c6d75; 27a0a7cc340ab0fc601c784cff14e23d50239eac; b0cdd840ab8ac9717a8dc69e05c8bd1eb41256e0; 057f38aeeb9bc1f5c9e07f493055b0aae4c0dec1; 00e03d69af20252b586fc0178a70ae36c6b0f19e; 95cc5189fde120c50990f7dd9cb11bacfb60148e; 85ada8a3fd7dd4ae08cd1818ff7d54355944d02b; 8a2affd19c813820507d728a42ef16b80a384625; d7fe2790a7e05d0ae87bcf0c9a300d933bf15671; 648b2d80daed0d43e1565f9817620c82cbde77e3; 909f12de870c55b51040161b59dee795e0428679; 23957808259d223597f901e670bebd29a9096307; cac6f52fe86dc6deb20b791a2d46eeb88b4371d9; c2c57dd6c43dc16c08e3fe0f82c7b0c41aeb3cb7; ad5aa86b6fbee91d84af4b4490906d3f92d8b5e2; 9f61da57ee5acee7068f170435dbaa5deedfe1e2; 8a3aea692749255a956d9b35079b7ace8eb8b94a; e8db9bbb09bef6122ddafe298ed56dd317c3b366; 2474a6435b0cbbfc68ef3b831bb91c10adef8b80; 9c0e669821115b1681c1e6b5809ef931c8729003; 2464af0b01bec6e932813ddeb9b45d1b9bb2e7fe; 11f277720090efcaceefe5a885d9ac51aa7ff7f8; ce46260253b8bd9ccef674405ad8a60fb61ed9fa; 57447a68aa662333415ad999bebc2e934bce6291; d242684747af6d0f123f3388d9e731cab0245539; 0cf86678e8627d58e2ae3f96fe69d0fd49c38e83; 9c050d9bb11d3a611b4910e9a084d9d6aa5a07e1; d17859485f8af84f69eb9e5ae2e45f4d352d1c58; 88ab3e8915e3b2736ca7f1709cfefd3acc5b06a7; 304682f7cf78f9e6bcda2196892f290b81e87d50; 0c2b37594184bd0270a4c59002218816c6815208; 4079135fe97bd123dc200cd4f21f8a839467ec26; a1ccbe4acc5be27463fc46375da0feeb25ad368a; e26bbf32909eceed33ce85e6af762f6030c52a29; 74da4352f52c9c503224202b499ef9514fcce22d; 24a67b89b23d33729eb9ab4e347f818b5e533836; 75320a3e5cde21e4e89f366835b9364369bad8cc,Archives of Toxicology,92,2681-2689
25dbc2bdb2a848f6c754d751d152461ab67340b5,Sex Differences in Circulating Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Disease.,"BACKGROUND
Differences in proteomic profiles between men and women may provide insights into the biological pathways that contribute to known sex differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD).


OBJECTIVES
This study sought to investigate sex differences in circulating biomarkers representative of biological pathways implicated in the development of CVD among Framingham Heart Study participants.


METHODS
The authors measured 71 circulating CVD protein biomarkers in 7,184 participants (54% women, mean age 49 years). Multivariable models were used to evaluate the associations of sex, menopause, and hormone status with biomarkers. Cox models were used to examine whether sex modified the association of biomarkers with incident CVD.


RESULTS
Of 71 biomarkers examined, 61 (86%) differed significantly between men and women, of which 37 were higher in women (including adipokines and inflammatory markers such as leptin and C-reactive protein), and 24 were higher in men (including fibrosis and platelet markers such as MMP-8 (matrix metalloproteinase-8) and TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1); false discovery rate qÂ <Â 0.05 for all). Sex differences in biomarker profiles were most pronounced between pre-menopausal women versus men, with attenuated sex differences among post-menopausal women not taking hormone replacement therapy. Sex modified the association of specific biomarkers with incident CVD, including CD14 and apolipoprotein B (pinteractionÂ <0.05 for all).


CONCLUSIONS
In a predominantly Caucasian population, the authors identified widespread sex differences in circulating biomarkers that reflect distinct pathways implicated in CVD, including inflammation, adiposity, fibrosis, and platelet homeostasis. Menopause and hormone status accounted for some, but not all, of the observed sex differences. Further investigation into factors underlying sex-based differences may provide mechanistic insight into CVD development.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Emily S.

Copy number variations (CNVs) are one form of human genetic variations that have been linked with complex diseases and often occur at different frequencies among African Americans and Caucasian populations. Here, we aimed to investigate whether CNVs with differential frequencies can contribute to health disparities from the perspective of gene networks. We inferred network clusters from human gene/protein networks based on two different data sources. We then evaluated each network cluster for the occurrences of known pathogenic genes and genes located in CNVs with different population frequencies, and used false discovery rates to rank network clusters. This approach let us identify five clusters enriched with known pathogenic genes and with genes located in CNVs with different frequencies between African Americans and Caucasians. These clustering patterns predict two candidate causal genes located in four population-specific CNVs that play potential roles in health disparities.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yi Jiang"", ids = ""145269150""); list(name = ""Hong Qin"", ids = ""145199626""); list(name = ""Li Yang"", ids = ""14948149"")",,4feee63aa5dda8b0d052130d089829601169463c; 9faf8b9c66ea95e6019b3ff8fff058b2cc618051; de1095fe416a014f6d2fccd093f70c19cc8c168f; 3448bc23b911ab7446d3384422cd4db8d6ddf111; aebb78079d9a81d843344e87df9f21d8755ea639; 8e3eba4769f5df7a07d5c0537e55a54aa3a51aa2; 236960eca2792e5f51b00b6e4daaf7fdc02fa07c; befc8b8f3865cfbb35634ea4db4aeca20a339d71; eddc172a618775a7cb19ca822c03743409035642; 6122f1e84c0dab96dc6b31659c29524f8b6f1e66; 496a38914e5179ac27ed0bbf53cd6c6372ce325c; 3d8f5e5e1399e27a722d656dfe61d95de65ac70f; f0cde35c9bd747aad96849d1f1b2c686a25316cf; 6d24e8cbe9309e5235f127e55f1a98d14f0930d4; 09b053572b43ee8997ccb8e6382d33beaf2a6cc9; 11f647b95a7c9a94c346cd8dc53987105cb0f7c1; 8ad71e8068703ef597154b4c0d90cefe5353c45d; e5a3011631b4d845d48326ca7b4b76b08f05cf6e; 451c2b09f99f7f99046863e8df49627776838e54; b75a0cccad7ff4a5a840c5a3683724ec938775dd; 281939819f7ca10ea68d66913bbe2de34852d63a; ab9fe0fe3b39e6f36dcf74a715e7adcd218325b2; 42d121ccca68f05c781835ab73244d016ffa1b71; 6cb7158ae9e2d22fe938338d4f400ec249a68650; 0340f2fa88e15c48361ca8d3c4b29f6faa8c2276; ec3df9c4dc803d3db3fbec3d4b828af282765d98; 76b97dd2112a4e4c58690fae54287fa632b87590; 9f3e8626ffa3b59a52fb4a60e8cad935b132c3af; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 586f34b1944f2796fb3b2bad46b566a6091a1c5e; c5b5029d6503b0aff11238945d06b68d89cc5a71; 24aa16df87fcfdb540b13fa9b7007f4d95cbcf7f; 8c48222c90bbeff0bcddad3cea75e4581167a190; b85ed323c9f06f4ccbb302a008ed93b016fcefcb; 8bda3d7a2608eae656628874e52e48bac963a5a5; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 2eced4351be4bf8fa4177d5196bba4c8f0fa916a; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; ceebc343c00e800b1b1b5d7bb68622666b697d3d; bb20bb11898d1c5239ed97363c8a8de2b5b53a3a; 18f677e5ee3f15a5531f45052a2bc78c15a800a4; 8bdfefc4d88f48e99e108a9b3185fbec1a5b1e8e; b26e3c4d1e467e7a4c94cd107b0d155dfedc4e4c; 730e105ffbe0f819a7a52799a3660d51fe5577b8; e63937184c8bc856924c06a7c584c8c48c573fc8; 7294df147937495a0e9fb1fbdeda08def80e95af; d4b82022469c0c9bad0ec0495e649521007dfa2f; a26532ee33b50ed523cf9f2a9951838ca2bc45de; 6876f72063ae46697ef6c646c656499169adf5f6; 381f2a246faff1807fbbe7abf6c2aec37d7142a0; 260660b6436c0b70a71c328e11abb014f541fff2; 056ee7e52cb0aa711d1ff0689cb111383aa9d86d; 60add4035c2b6d4b9888cb1028c31e6bed793d60; 01cf71b54008d6aa2207000fc94aa447f7300a5e; 0d1fecf2b9e5e0f154923ecc26cc543341a84c7e; fc30910a8bf8daa3256284580b1dfe98b32d3559; dddfb8735deaff8956a7310003243eb533c3df53; 139710823d7b0d3d32b60b9307e26feac375e40a; e81dbc50defbb1c5ce0f3c027f53c5fa24c98e06; f31375f51391b23414a09dec0c2550fd2c92ee15; 57ff1faaaf2b2eed57d1a9a6cd8b2ef2182f020a; fc90bd571818dacf9f19d4198c6e00d948632d2b; 93aeef23c1679eb0b34a289bb97c785a6f44c424; 218aed10cd9dedecd789d8251f40fa446a4ab629; 79b3b53dcf0e2835e80dbc58b0b8c7b19e99db64; 37b532e966bec55bf2f28afec5c47b34ad56c98c; 6c81e44e7e6565c9853badd198e50a0f19523dbd,PeerJ,3,
33ca81a6c69340da77b9239fde824b317b6a25f6,Smoking and COX-2 Functional Polymorphisms Interact to Increase the Risk of Gastric Cardia Adenocarcinoma in Chinese Population,"BACKGROUND
Over-expression and increased activity of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 induced by smoking has been implicated in the development of cancer. This study aimed to explore the interaction between smoking and functional polymorphisms of COX-2 in modulation of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) risk.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
Three COX-2 polymorphisms, including -1195G>A (rs689466), -765G>C (rs20417), and 587Gly>Arg (rs3218625), were genotyped in 357 GCA patients and 985 controls. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that the -1195AA, -765GC, and 587Arg/Arg genotypes were associated with increased risk of GCA (ORâ€Š=â€Š1.50, 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š1.05-2.13; ORâ€Š=â€Š2.06, 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š1.29-3.29 and ORâ€Š=â€Š1.67, 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š1.04-2.66, respectively). Haplotype association analysis showed that compared with G(-1195)-G(-765)- G(Gly587Arg), the A(-1195)-C(-765)-A(Gly587Arg) conferred an increased risk of GCA (ORâ€Š=â€Š2.49, 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š1.54-4.01). Moreover, significant multiplicative interactions were observed between smoking and these three polymorphisms of -1195G>A, -765G>C, and 587Gly>Arg, even after correction by false discovery rate (FDR) method for multiple comparisons (FDR-P(interaction)â€Š=â€Š0.006, 5.239Ã—10(-4) and 0.017, respectively). Similarly, haplotypes incorporating these three polymorphisms also showed significant interaction with smoking in the development of GCA (P for multiplicative interactionâ€Š=â€Š2.65Ã—10(-6)).


CONCLUSION
These findings indicated that the functional polymorphisms of COX-2, in interaction with smoking, may play a substantial role in the development of GCA.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xue-mei Zhang"", ids = ""120070025""); list(name = ""Rong Zhong"", ids = ""144390571""); list(name = ""L.

The labeled cDNA hybridization to the Affymetrix U133 2.0 arrays, array fluidics processing and scanning were performed under standardized conditions recommended by Affymetrix. Analysis of the microarray expression profile was performed using genespring multiomics software. RESULTS: We found that only 3.08% of gene probes were differentially expressed from early to late passage of AFSC culture. The differentially expressed genes were related to biological processes or cellular function including transcription factors, protein kinases, and cytokines/ growth factors. Other gene-sets of interest were oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, which were a very small number of genes. We further analyzed the gene sets of interest using NIH DAVID and GSEA bioinformatics databases for gene annotations analysis. Applying false discovery rate correction, there was no significant difference in the genome-wide expression profiling between early and late passage.

These challenges have led to many biological oversights and computational misconceptions. We developed an empirical Bayes model to analyze multiprotein complex (MPC) proteomics data derived from peptide mass spectrometry detections of purified protein complex pull-down experiments. Using our model and two yeast proteomics data sets, we estimated that there should be an average of about 20 true associations per MPC, almost 10 times as high as was previously estimated. For data sets generated to mimic a real proteome, our model achieved on average 80% sensitivity in detecting true associations, as compared with the 3% sensitivity in previous work, while maintaining a comparable false discovery rate of 0.3%.

496e50e5c8b2dc5779ee993538d5ad9a75ce4568,Controlling two-dimensional false discovery rates by combining two univariate multiple testing results with an application to mass spectral data,"Abstract Mass spectral data exhibit a small number of signals (true peaks) among many noisy observations (signals or true peaks) in a high-dimensional space. This unique aspect of mass spectral data necessitates solving the problem of testing for many composite null hypotheses simultaneously. In this study, we develop a new procedure to control the false discovery rate of simultaneous multiple hypothesis tests, consisting of many â€œbivariateâ€ composite null hypotheses. Two types of composite null hypothesis, the intersection-type and the union-type null, are considered separately. The proposed procedure comprises two stages. In the first stage, we simultaneously test each â€œunivariateâ€ simple hypothesis of â€œbivariateâ€ composite hypotheses at the pre-decided false discovery rate. In the second stage, we combine the marginal univariate test results so that the two-dimensional false discovery rate for the â€œbivariateâ€ composite null hypotheses is less than the desired significance level Î±. The new procedure provides a closed-form decision rule on the bivariate test statistics, unlike existing methods for controlling the two-dimensional local false discovery rate (2d-fdr). We numerically compare the performance of our procedure to existing 2d-fdr control methods in different settings. We then apply the procedure to the problem of differentiating the origins of herbal medicine using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Youngrae Kim"", ids = ""2333537""); list(name = ""Johan Lim"", ids = ""39605319""); list(name = ""Jong Soo Lee"", ids = ""46664148""); list(name = ""Jaesik Jeong"", ids = ""49995810"")",548e2c5963a44afefa1d96f35434cf3ca3d7a6a9,,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems,182,149-157

Schizophrenia candidate genes participate in common molecular pathways that are regulated by activity-dependent changes in neurons. One important next step is to further our understanding on the role of activity-dependent changes of gene expression in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia.


Objective
To examine whether neuronal activity-dependent changes of gene expression are dysregulated in schizophrenia.


Design, Setting, and Participants
Neurons differentiated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells derived from 4 individuals with schizophrenia and 4 unaffected control individuals were depolarized using potassium chloride. RNA was extracted followed by genome-wide profiling of the transcriptome. Neurons were planted on June 21, 2013, and harvested on August 2, 2013.


Main Outcomes and Measures
We performed differential expression analysis and gene coexpression analysis to identify activity-dependent or disease-specific changes of the transcriptome. Gene expression differences were assessed with linear models. Furthermore, we used gene set analyses to identify coexpressed modules that are enriched for schizophrenia risk genes.


Results
We identified 1669 genes that were significantly different in schizophrenia-associated vs control human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and 1199 genes that are altered in these cells in response to depolarization (linear models at false discovery rate â‰¤0.05). The effect of activity-dependent changes of gene expression in schizophrenia-associated neurons (59 significant genes at false discovery rate â‰¤0.05) was attenuated compared with control samples (594 significant genes at false discovery rate â‰¤0.05). Using gene coexpression analysis, we identified 2 modules (turquoise and brown) that were associated with diagnosis status and 2 modules (yellow and green) that were associated with depolarization at a false discovery rate of â‰¤0.05. For 3 of the 4 modules, we found enrichment with schizophrenia-associated variants: brown (Ï‡2â€‰=â€‰20.68; Pâ€‰=â€‰.002), turquoise (Ï‡2â€‰=â€‰12.95; Pâ€‰=â€‰.04), and yellow (Ï‡2â€‰=â€‰15.34; Pâ€‰=â€‰.02).


Conclusions and Relevance

ca7326493c861768f419111d78ff083dd72f6a98,Identification of shared genetic variants between schizophrenia and lung cancer,"Epidemiology studies suggest associations between schizophrenia and cancer. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms are not well understood, and difficult to identify from epidemiological data. We investigated if there is a shared genetic architecture between schizophrenia and cancer, with the aim to identify specific overlapping genetic loci. First, we performed genome-wide enrichment analysis and second, we analyzed specific loci jointly associated with schizophrenia and cancer by the conjunction false discovery rate. We analyzed the largest genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia and lung, breast, prostate, ovary, and colon-rectum cancer including more than 220,000 subjects, and included genetic association with smoking behavior. Polygenic enrichment of associations with lung cancer was observed in schizophrenia, and weak enrichment for the remaining cancer sites. After excluding the major histocompatibility complex region, we identified three independent loci jointly associated with schizophrenia and lung cancer. The strongest association included nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and is an established pleiotropic locus shared between lung cancer and smoking. The two other loci were independent of genetic association with smoking. Functional analysis identified downstream pleiotropic effects on epigenetics and gene-expression in lung and brain tissue. These findings suggest that genetic factors may explain partly the observed epidemiological association of lung cancer and schizophrenia.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Verena Zuber"", ids = ""2882566""); list(name = ""Erik G.

This study was undertaken to investigate the miRNA expression profile in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). 277 miRNAs were quantified using RT-qPCR from six normal dogs (American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine Stage A), six dogs with MMVD mild to moderate cardiac enlargement (ACVIM Stage B1/B2) and six dogs with MMVD and congestive heart failure (ACVIM Stage C/D). Eleven miRNAs were differentially expressed (False Discovery Rate < 0.05). Dogs in Stage B1/B2 or C/D had four upregulated miRNAs, including three cfa-let-7/cfa-miR-98 family members, while seven others were downregulated, compared to Stage A. Expression of six of the 11 miRNAs also were significantly different between dogs in Stage C/D and those in Stage B1/B2. The expression changes were greater as disease severity increased.

949a94f82ec6ab559a7dc0c6232497fe6b4c128e,Copy number differences in EGFR and other amplicons between primary colon tumors and paired lymph node metastasis.,"498 Background: Prior study, demonstrating differential immunohistochemical EGFR expression between the primary colon cancer and the liver metastasis, suggested possible molecular differences between the two tumor sites. This questions the relevance of obtaining genomic information from the primary tumor to guide adjuvant treatment. In this study we examine whether there are genomic differences specific to metastatic nodes versus the paired colon primary samples.


METHODS
Using 30 primary and lymph node metastasis pairs (dissected for >80% tumor from paraffin embedded tissue), we obtained a dataset of copy number derived from the Affymetrix Oncoscan Molecular Inversion Probe platform. Using the Nexus Copy Number software for processing, we used the default automatic segmentation of the copy number data with a threshold for calling copy number gains/losses of 2.3/1.7. Subsequently we applied the Wilcoxon signed-rank test in order to find regions showing copy number imbalance that differ between the paired nodes and tumors correcting for multiple comparisons by performing permutation-based estimation of the false discovery rate permuting the samples 100 times.


RESULTS
Using 40 ng of total DNA from paraffin embedded tumor from primary and tumor in positive nodes, we obtained high quality, genome wide copy number data. Using FDR < 0.1, we identified four chromosomal segments that showed statistically significant increased likelihood of copy number gains in the primary tumor compared to the tumor-containing node. Thirty five percent of tumor-bearing lymph nodes were copy number normal at the EGFR locus whereas the corresponding primary tumor showed amplification at 7p11.2 (includes the EGFR gene). A similar pattern was observed for 8q24, 14q11.2, and 20q12-q13; regions associated with aggressive tumor behavior.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results demonstrate four significant differences between the primary tumor and lymph node metastasis and in all cases the metastasis were copy number normal compared to the copy number gain observed in the primary tumor. These results support the importance to examine differences at the genome level between the metastatic tumor site and the primary.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Vassiliki L Tsikitis"", ids = ""3521914""); list(name = ""David G.

c58af9fab3e80c908b662ae691ff49818a68ad69,Epigenetics of response to biologic drug therapy in rheumatoid arthritis,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common complex autoimmune disorder which is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. While multiple factors that influence susceptibility to and outcome of disease have been identified there is still a large proportion of missing heritability and limited understanding of disease pathogenesis. In recent years, biologic drug therapies have advanced treatment of RA; however good disease control is achieved in just 30% of patients, making identification of predictors of treatment response important. One area of research which is yet to be explored in relation to treatment response, and requires further evaluation in RA susceptibility, is epigenetics. Epigenetics is the study of modifications of the DNA which can influence gene expression but do not alter genetic sequence, and the most commonly studied epigenetic phenomenon, to date, is DNA methylation.Objectives: To identify DNA methylation signatures predictive of treatment response to anti-TNF biologics, to explore the role of DNA methylation in RA susceptibility using disease discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins, and to assess the effect of cryopreservation of cells on DNA methylation.Methods: Genome-wide DNA methylation levels were measured using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in pre-treatment whole blood DNA samples from individuals who had extremely good or extremely poor response to the anti-TNF therapies, etanercept and adalimumab, and in MZ twins discordant for RA (n=79 pairs). I also compared genome-wide methylation in cells which had been cryopreserved with fresh cells, to investigate if this technique is suitable for epigenetic investigations.Results: I identified four methylation sites which were significantly related to response to etanercept at a false discovery rate of 5%, the most significantly differentially methylated of which maps to the LRPAP1 gene (p=1.46E-8). Indeed, four other sites at the same locus also showed evidence for differential methylation indicating that this represents a differentially methylated region. No sites were significantly associated with response to adalimumab after correction for multiple testing. I identified subtle differences in DNA methylation between RA discordant twins. Although these were not statistically significant following adjustment for cell composition, one of the most differentially methylated positions mapped to the ZNF74 gene (p=4.97E-6), and replicated a methylation difference identified in the largest previous epigenome-wide association study of RA cases and unrelated healthy controls. I found that cryopreservation of cells does not significantly alter the methylome, an important observation that will impact upon design of future studies.Conclusions: In the largest studies of DNA methylation in RA treatment response and RA discordant MZ twins to date, I identified significant differential methylation in etanercept response, but not adalimumab response, and found small differences in methylation in RA discordant MZ twins. I also concluded that cryopreservation does not significantly alter the methylome.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Amy P.

30a1233f5af8bbddd29b28cc9188c25025cd2e31,Air pollution and inflammation: Findings from concurrent repeated measures of systemic and reproductive tract cytokines during term pregnancy in Mexico City.,"BACKGROUND
Environmental exposures are associated with a number of outcomes including adverse pregnancy outcomes. Although inflammation is hypothesized to play a role, the mechanistic pathways between environmental exposures and adverse health outcomes, including associations between exposures and longitudinal measures of systemic and reproductive tract inflammation, need elucidation.


OBJECTIVES
This study was conducted to evaluate whether exposure to air pollution is associated with immunologic responses in the systemic circulation and lower reproductive tract, and to evaluate whether systemic and reproductive tract immunologic responses are similar.


METHODS
We quantified repeated measures of cytokines from cervico-vaginal exudates and serum obtained concurrently among 104 women with term pregnancies and estimated PM10 and CO exposure using the monitor nearest each participant's residence. Serum and cervico-vaginal cytokines were compared using Wilcoxon signed-ranks test and Spearman rank correlations for select gestational months. We used intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) to quantify reproducibility of cytokine measurements, and Tobit regression to estimate associations between air pollution and cytokines.


RESULTS
Median cervico-vaginal levels of IL-6, Eotaxin, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1Î±, MIP-1Î², and TNFÎ± were higher than corresponding serum cytokines, significantly so for IL-6 and IP-10. Cervico-vaginal and serum cytokines were not correlated, but cytokines from the same fluid were correlated. ICCs for most serum cytokines were â‰¤0.40, while ICCs were higher in cervico-vaginal cytokines (range 0.52-0.83). IP-10 and Eotaxin had the highest ICCs for both cytokine sources. In adjusted models, PM10 was positively associated with serum cytokines IL-6, IP-10, MIP-1Î² and Eotaxin but inversely associated with cervico-vaginal cytokine TNFÎ±, IP-10, MIP-1Î², MCP-1 and Eotaxin, controlling for false discovery rate. CO was inversely associated with cervico-vaginal TNFÎ±, IL-6, MIP-1Î², MCP-1 and Eotaxin.


CONCLUSIONS
Inflammatory processes are compartment-specific. Systemic inflammatory markers may provide information on immunologic processes and response to environmental exposures, but are not proxies for lower reproductive tract inflammation.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Miatta A.

RNA sequencing (RNAseq) has been used to identify mechanisms of secondary resistance to immunotherapy. Patients and methods: Patientsâ€™ metastatic tumors were multi-site biopsied at relapse under immunotherapies after a period of clinical benefit, defined by a partial response or a stable disease of more than 6 months. Genome-wide RNAseq counts were intra-patient normalized and a score of each geneâ€™s expression was computed in comparison to a cohort of 450 metastatic cancer patients with RNAseq available at the time of analysis. Results: To date, 10 patients treated by immunotherapies have had a successful RNAseq in the MATCH-R trial. Five patients were treated with PD-1 inhibitors and 5 with PD-L1 inhibitors. Three patients had NSCLC, 2 MSI high endometrial carcinoma, 2 anal carcinoma, 2 urothelial carcinoma and 1 TNBC. Eight out off ten patients had an expression of IDO1 higher than the median expression of IDO1 in our 450 controls (p value = 0.005). A patient with endometrial carcinoma had one of the highest expressions of IDO1 in the cohort. Consistently, IDO1 activation has previously been reported as a mechanism of secondary resistance to immunotherapies. A 40 year old smoker NSCLC patient with a TP53 mutation has been treated during 11 months with anti-PD1. RNAseq analysis on the biopsy of a progressive lesion showed decreased expression of different actors of the JAK-STAT pathway (biopsy composed of 40% tumor cells and 60% microenvironment). Of the 78 genes signatures used (including 52 immunogenes signatures), the interferon gamma signature had the lowest expression (p value = 0.004), consistent with a previous report of JAK-STAT-induced resistance to immunotherapy. Two more patients had an altered immune profile that could be involved in resistance to immunotherapies, but was not yet reported in the litterature. Confirmation of the RNAseq analysis with immunohistochemistry is currently ongoing. The gene signatures of the 10 patients, composed of immunogenes, DNA repair genes and epigenes, were compared to the whole cohort in order to deduce corresponding false discovery rates. As such we could identify 2 gene clusters, one enriched in T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages, and the other enriched in epigenes and DNA repair genes. Analysis of more patients is currently ongoing in order to cluster the results with clinical characteristics. Conclusion: Gene expression in the biopsy of patients that relapsed after initial benefit to immunotherapy is informative and helps to identify the mechanism of acquired resistance.

94e99dfa366bd806a19c617335cba558d250a745,Adaptive Filtering Procedures for Replicability Analysis of High-throughput Experiments,"Replicability is a fundamental quality of scientific discoveries. While meta-analysis provides a framework to evaluate the strength of signals across multiple studies accounting for experimental variability, it does not investigate replicability. A single, possibly non-reproducible study, can be enough to bring significance. In contrast, the partial conjunction (PC) alternative hypothesis stipulates that for a chosen number $r$ ($r > 1$), at least $r$ out of $n$ related individual hypotheses are non-null, making it a useful measure of replicability. Motivated by genetics problems, we consider settings where a large number $M$ of partial conjunction null hypotheses are tested, using an $n\times M$ matrix of $p$-values where $n$ is the number of studies. Applying multiple testing adjustments directly to PC $p$-values can be very conservative. We here introduce AdaFilter, a new procedure that, mindful of the fact that the PC null is a composite hypothesis, increases power by filtering out unlikely candidate PC hypotheses using the whole $p$-value matrix. We prove that appropriate versions of AdaFilter control the familywise error rate and the per family error rate under independence. We show that these error rates and the false discovery rate can be controlled under independence and a within-study local dependence structure while achieving much higher power than existing methods. We illustrate the effectiveness of the AdaFilter procedures with three different case studies.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jingshu Wang"", ids = ""49606825""); list(name = ""Weijie J.

7f6477af86a180878558de84ec9a49217c488fe2,P67Long non-coding RNAs in the infarcted heart,"Purpose: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute a novel class of non-coding RNAs. LncRNAs regulate gene expression, thus having the possibility to modulate disease progression. In this study, we investigated the expression of lncRNAs in the heart after myocardial infarction (MI).

Methods: Adult male C57/BL6 mice were subjected to coronary ligation or sham operation. Cardiac gene expression was investigated using whole-genome microarrays with an in-house analytical pipeline dedicated to lncRNAs. Cardiac function was evaluated by 18F-fluorodesoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET).

Results: In a derivation group of 4 MI and 4 sham-operated mice sacrificed 24 hours after surgery, microarray analysis showed that MI significantly affected the cardiac transcriptome. 20 lncRNAs were up-regulated in the MI group, and 10 lncRNAs were down-regulated in the MI group (fold-change >2, false discovery rate 0.8). Bioinformatic analyses of microarray data revealed that lncRNA1 expression displayed strong association with genes coding for proteins involved in angiogenesis, fibrosis, hypertrophy, inflammation, and extracellular matrix remodeling, all pathways involved in the development of left ventricular remodeling and heart failure post MI. Among the genes most highly correlated with lncRNA1 (r>0.80), MMP9, TNFalpha, CXCR4, and BNP were all up-regulated in the heart of MI mice.

Conclusion: We show for the first time that expression of lncRNAs is regulated in the infarcted heart. This study provides the basis for future investigations of the role of lncRNAs in the diseased heart.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Jennifer Zangrando"", ids = ""6032625""); list(name = ""Leichao Zhang"", ids = ""13800470""); list(name = ""Melanie Vausort"", ids = ""2873986""); list(name = ""Fathia Maskali"", ids = ""15389911""); list(name = ""Pierre-Yves Marie"", ids = ""144365011""); list(name = ""Wagner"", ids = ""121493900""); list(name = ""Yvan Devaux"", ids = ""145571634"")",,,Cardiovascular Research,103,
0507cfa3a85f11cf66278aad5724d41380019ccb,MAGICACT: A tool for predicting transcription factors and cofactors driving gene lists using ENCODE data,"Transcriptomic profiling is an immensely powerful hypothesis generating tool. However, accurately predicting the transcription factors (TFs) and cofactors that drive transcriptomic differences between samples represents a challenge and current approaches are limited by high false discovery rates. This is due to the use of TF binding sequence motifs that, due their small size, are found randomly throughout the genome, and do not allow discovery of cofactors. A second limitation is that even the most advanced approaches that use ChIPseq tracks hosted at sites such as the Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) assign TFs and cofactors to genes via a binary designation of â€˜targetâ€™, or â€˜non-targetâ€™ that ignores the intricacies of the biology behind transcriptional regulation. ENCODE archives ChIPseq tracks of 169 TFs and cofactors assayed in 91 cell lines. The algorithm presented herein, Mann whitney Analysis of Gene Cohorts for Associated Cofactors and Transcription factors (MAGICACT), uses ENCODE ChIPseq data to look for statistical enrichment of TFs and cofactors in gene bodies and flanking regions in gene lists. When compared to 2 commonly used web resources, o-Possum and Enrichr, MAGICACT was able to more accurately predict TFs and cofactors that drive gene changes in 3 settings: 1) A cell line expressing or lacking single TF, 2) Breast tumors divided along PAM50 designations and 3) Whole brain samples from WT mice or mice lacking a single TF in a particular neuronal subtype. In summary, MAGICACT is a standalone application that runs on OSX and Windows machines that produces meaningful predictions of which TFs and cofactors are enriched in a gene list.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Avtar Roopra"", ids = ""50666254"")",2ac00a03d317179f59b8d78ab0bc0ca757267f2e,c024275cd5a2642459ab5f626428053b2c1e0e9f; 92eb394497bbfac4caaff98613931516829d2e88; 6b42e0e10a962803ba7115dbbf8ab6b3a8e40dfa; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 705d0b43d6e894d538fc5d6d9be076c4117c280b; 80e1b2c8137566aef59affe22d913fb3bee1911b; 472bd1528e07bb190c0a1e0a69ba3f6ecb6c9f90; f9d723b94bcaa230978b0c3de2e657ed1c636702; f0d5ec692aefb067cb393dea0f27a34b553efaaa; 3329b64342bf8dd2442aec0ce7b806d955fe6421; 8705dc8973afb7c9cad5aeb860b66cde464fb33f; 1b3e8b0d60a81829728e372cc08598bc8ed3f934; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; db313ddd2a2d18c5d9a79a86b4edeab715f2c2f6; 01358c778364ecc513dfe88aa959e13807d1be47; c2bcc86e00476c3c705da7bbafe70966178aeec1; 0f66e5630967dabcbebdc915945568a9a153c2b8; 0f64f36368d9e2f2e132fd7fa437edcc8f84f99d; 1d8c55014c64b1066c53fdfdfe9c5f6531e90cc0; 74153888ebbeb068b74d0e6bcc84b9ed646f21e4; e33ab169a9486c8ac2cafeb5ce3ff1f125ed391c; 2ed31ee1b40c4108725268bc9e6ec55806d3a7bb; 378b758a12bf6f954572338de28a89cd2fa47d1f; 844d80c0e17d09d2c83505fe46dcdf41c5fe95c8; f7a00e89ca6954cc19374ccd53c034ac1d449f8a,bioRxiv,,

The proposed method uses a single example of an action as a query to find similar matches. It does not require prior knowledge about actions, foreground/background segmentation, or any motion estimation or tracking. Our method is based on the computation of novel space-time descriptors from the query video which measure the likeness of a voxel to its surroundings. Salient features are extracted from said descriptors and compared against analogous features from the target video. This comparison is done using a matrix generalization of the cosine similarity measure. The algorithm yields a scalar resemblance volume, with each voxel indicating the likelihood of similarity between the query video and all cubes in the target video. Using nonparametric significance tests by controlling the false discovery rate, we detect the presence and location of actions similar to the query video. High performance is demonstrated on challenging sets of action data containing fast motions, varied contexts, and complicated background.

378791acc82f073ded4a4285372f55c7919831a3,Whole genome expression differences in human left and right atria ascertained by RNA sequencing.,"BACKGROUND
The left and right atria have different susceptibilities toward developing arrhythmias, with left atrial arrhythmias more commonly observed. To understand the molecular basis for such differences, we catalogued micro (mi)RNA and mRNA expression differences by next generation sequencing.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Four human left-right atrial pairs were subjected to whole-genome expression analyses via next-generation sequencing of small RNAs, including miRNAs, and poly-A-enriched mRNAs. Using a paired sample design, significant differences in the expression of 32 miRNAs were found in between the left and right atria at a probability value of <0.01. Hsa-miR-143 was the most highly expressed miRNA in the atria, as quantified by RNA sequencing. There were 746 and 2292 differentially expressed mRNAs between the left and right atria at false discovery rates of <0.001 and <0.05, respectively. Transcription factor binding elements within 2 kb of RefSeq genes were determined and specific motifs were identified that were enriched in differentially expressed genes. Similarly, specific miRNA target sequences in 3' UTRs were also enriched in differentially expressed genes. In addition, 11 novel noncoding RNAs of unknown function were found to be differentially expressed between the left and right atria.

3c6acc1d0954196f82ec656c1a2994fec8cb1f4b,Y-chromosome diversity in Catalan surname samples: insights into surname origin and frequency,"The biological behavior of the Y chromosome, which is paternally inherited, implies that males sharing the same surname may also share a similar Y chromosome. However, socio-cultural factors, such as polyphyletism, non-paternity, adoption, or matrilineal surname transmission, may prevent the joint transmission of the surname and the Y chromosome. By genotyping 17 Y-STRs and 68 SNPs in ~2500 male samples that each carried one of the 50 selected Catalan surnames, we could determine sets of descendants of a common ancestor, the population of origin of the common ancestor, and the date when such a common ancestor lived. Haplotype diversity was positively correlated with surname frequency, that is, rarer surnames showed the strongest signals of coancestry. Introgression rates of Y chromosomes into a surname by non-paternity, adoption, and transmission of the maternal surname were estimated at 1.5âˆ’2.6% per generation, with some local variation. Average ages for the founders of the surnames were estimated at ~500 years, suggesting a delay between the origin of surnames (twelfth and thirteenth centuries) and the systematization of their paternal transmission. We have found that, in general, a foreign etymology for a surname does not often result in a non-indigenous origin of surname founders; however, bearers of some surnames with an Arabic etymology show an excess of North African haplotypes. Finally, we estimate that surname prediction from a Y-chromosome haplotype, which may have interesting forensic applications, has a ~60% sensitivity but a 17% false discovery rate.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Neus SolÃ©-Morata"", ids = ""1402055567""); list(name = ""Jaume Bertranpetit"", ids = ""1925702""); list(name = ""David Comas"", ids = ""3125990""); list(name = ""Francesc Calafell"", ids = ""3248559"")",b697eccebf201c57ed3f8d491090c003e4711cab; a01414994c412cdf87ccba64bbf8fad16636a874; ce288ef3d6e08d0d97dac895ba4d89c06d811e85; cb24e5f07b640dd50604e262c7809bbf1acb2b93; 9af88b18e4dd85bb19da54b724a3aec83de413dc; 2de5c9915fc27d30f9cd1a1da99b2f086594e60b; 0a1c63dc78993da1e7a7c59ee92392be961303f9; 363551ce6a4ec8cbb783b24534b20149e744240c; 4abd4ef5ea39e01cdbfd071df1bdcef927794317; 00a44d23fbed96dac89f1e70c8482bd62b9f0f14; d0f935ba50f0eead360056868a3db60b2b503582; 8999fb74da292c4500937fdc4b68cd36b9bc397a; 15b261d32c701b2462ef024a20001b0d8355efda; 765302c81b826b8163331c31345cc93726eb37b3; db1f73194950b40fbed70f3aa10de3b840fe78cb,bc673e125c11bed405eb87976b2bbb09c0f9edd3; 8b175bf3a490cb02751c487c1a3cc18fe89663c5; 1abde19a7e907b7db8b20ddd034c07f1355b52ce; 9a4f2bcae608cb7011715c109d060724c4564f37; 6800bf69663cbd3d9b497f52ff8bc49d2f22a2d5; 90913b56cbf8cc8a86c944b4db7f5b81ea2d86a8; c0331f829ef735a696e32c0033467764e1806b35; d119c819e880b20a144456b81d956aa987399063; 7c03f208b152a427d059044fd0eedbae10ff3e5c; b77394c39de74c9a9527ef68c4a531c7fc1984b6; bfb4b4ce84d303c0526d02d9dbfd07202c54cd1c; 936d384529d06b4ae34d87d77ac2a1deb149eebc; 3537dc4ea1368d85bf522845008a4a2fc3a628f1; 1939ecdcfe01db26357eb70b36c288ecbb4b6c20; 6fe919239c9ae4f7c90142c3c106eee732e16b85; 94567129bce44e922435950413ffb4cb5afeeea2; f8f500bcfc460a79baf826574edf1eb9ffbcf689; 23681b24723a2a91c9754b0cf13ce7bf234af4b3; 9a1c3774d04715c6c3f1a5d02757f8ec15efb0b4; 24eb2666375126a2653236564d61e52ed15a3a33; fe2c0aab78271d7efb2be21992061a339b512eea; 2eee0473dd8bbb7b16c3f689921a9ae2e6bebcb2; 2b42eb3c110bc6964cf29f750ce49d7c864cecce; 56f703fd3b428294544725e0f2719b1a3005d3d0; b91a36398ebe174f4044eb88debb2c26a335fd33; 6fd87446a6ab4110fe7f8714680bbc8317f6e457; 5f0624e8676c3d87b2e10741bd0643ddc4b14b57,European Journal of Human Genetics,23,1549-1557
3eac3f74403b62a1d64095a0b3975ac0686b2882,Drug-Induced Amyloidosis: A Proteomic Insight Into 52 Cases,"The amyloidoses are heterogeneous diseases associated with the deposition of insoluble proteins or peptides with a characteristic beta-diffraction pattern extracellularly. At the current time, over 27 different extracellular fibril proteins are known to cause disease in humans. Iatrogenic amyloidosis is a rare, often not sought diagnosis. On occasion, patients with drug induced amyloidosis can present with other systemic features reminiscent of systemic immunoglobulin-derived (AL) amyloidosis, and may present a diagnostic challenge. Treatment of the latter often involves chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplantation, while the former tends to remain localized and needs local therapy; thus accurate diagnosis is critical. To this end, proteomic analysis of amyloid tissue has proven to be an invaluable tool in amyloid typing. We have analyzed the biochemical composition of iatrogenic amyloid using laser capture/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomic analysis in 52 cases of insulin and enfuvirtide (FuzeonÂ¨) associated amyloidosis.

In brief, 10-Î¼m-thick sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with Congo red. Congo red positively staining tissue as viewed with a fluorescent light source appeared bright red. Positive areas were dissected using laser microdissection to a volume of at least 60,000 Î¼m2; three microdissections were analyzed for each case. The microdissected material was collected into 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube caps containing 35 Î¼L Tris/EDTA/0.002% Zwittergent buffer. Microdissected fragments were subjected to a heat-mediated antigen retrieval method (98C for 90minutes) before being denatured via sonication and subsequently digested into tryptic peptides overnight using 0.5ug of trypsin. The resulting digests were then analyzed with nanoflow LC-MS/MS. The MS/MS spectra of each case were matched against a composite protein sequence database using three different search algorithms (Sequest, X!Tandem, and Mascot). The composite database contained the human SwissProt entries but was also augmented with known immunoglobulin variant domains, known amyloidogenic mutations from literature, the enfuvirtide amino acid sequence, and common contaminants. Reversed protein sequences were appended to the database for estimating the false discovery rates of the identifications. The peptide identification results were filtered using Scaffold software (Proteome Software, Portland, OR) and then filtered peptides were assembled into protein identifications. Candidate proteins with at least one high-confident (probability of identification >90%) unique peptide identification and at least four MS/MS spectral matches were considered for clinical interpretation.

For each case, we created a personalized proteomic profile that lists all the confident protein identifications in each of the microdissection along with their respective MS/MS spectral counts. The number of MS/MS spectra matching to a protein is considered as a semi-quantitative measure of its abundance. The most abundant amyloidogenic protein detected across all microdissections and as interpreted in the context of the clinical history is considered to be the amyloid subtype.

[Figure 1][1] shows the results of insulin amyloidosis. [Figure 2][2] shows the results of enfuvirtide amyloidosis. Amyloid deposits are shown to be composed of the recombinant drug in addition to amyloid precursor proteins such as apolipoprotein A-I, A-IV, E and serum amyloid P (SAP).

In conclusion, we show the biochemical composition of all known drug-induced iatrogenic amyloidosis and provide the utility of proteomic analysis in elucidating amyloid subtyping for accurate diagnosis and management.

Legend: A spectral count number of greater than 4 is significant. The green boxes denote protein identification at a probability of over 95%, and yellow 80-94%. In [figure 1][1], insulin (# 2) and in [figure 2][2], enfuvirtide (#5) are shown in abundance, additionally other amyloid precursors such as apolipoproteins A-IV, E, A-I and SAP are also seen.

8780c691991b59cab2f2478775d443c011ebbe5d,Environment and vascular bed origin influence differences in endothelial transcriptional profiles of coronary and iliac arteries.,"Atherosclerotic plaques tend to form in the major arteries at certain predictable locations. As these arteries vary in atherosusceptibility, interarterial differences in endothelial cell biology are of considerable interest. To explore the origin of differences observed between typical atheroprone and atheroresistant arteries, we used DNA microarrays to compare gene expression profiles of harvested porcine coronary (CECs) and iliac artery endothelial cells (IECs) grown in static culture out to passage 4. Fewer differences were observed between the transcriptional profiles of CECs and IECs in culture compared with in vivo, suggesting that most differences observed in vivo were due to distinct environmental cues in the two arteries. One-class significance of microarrays revealed that most in vivo interarterial differences disappeared in culture, as fold differences after passaging were not significant for 85% of genes identified as differentially expressed in vivo at 5% false discovery rate. However, the three homeobox genes, HOXA9, HOXA10, and HOXD3, remained underexpressed in coronary endothelium for all passages by at least nine-, eight-, and twofold, respectively. Continued differential expression, despite removal from the in vivo environment, suggests that primarily heritable or epigenetic mechanism(s) influences transcription of these three genes. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed expression ratios for seven genes associated with atherogenesis and over- or underexpressed by threefold in CECs relative to IECs. The present study provides evidence that both local environment and vascular bed origin modulate gene expression in arterial endothelium. The transcriptional differences observed here may provide new insights into pathways responsible for coronary artery susceptibility.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Kelley Ann Burridge"", ids = ""38810727""); list(name = ""Morton H Friedman"", ids = ""49663931"")",c8f3535aa95b8648b962daff2861c93ee25938d6; 719819bc14a4196ea65c36564843f09c2b0147fa; b441e5219735e8b6b7d2699dcdb54084c874bd43; dc9ba3cb52b2ab9a10bf8b778c0956527bebd6a1; c0d368d2522f2f87c66f42d6374d7a0db1cdf7c4; f0a218fab12d6f5edce6fa95a0fd5525f7ede076; 255e69d36e0d31f0a730075311ffc2da5e954a91; 0c8cf25f54ac0f6ad9c8800d94ba90b35e33e690; 7b3cf8a6b80c463bb23e6c9391129c7f6ee5affc; c7fc40f66a9fa1687e484ede2cdca80bbd8c06e4; 2fed32bba8f6228dd9d05ea53611388155784f01; 2ba5db62a3d19bd4e7ed739c0ad65c8438463063; 82e692e715345e30db61950242ee4d88a3e998bb; 098e8a7fb2f5fe04632ae06ab65618ed45ded271; cf9636d238535e292894d2aa050529891447a356; 9c6c03fd13ee315022fe61c222445dc47ebd300c; 3a5ed8a9fbf4a7cad82b2a4f58e2bfa6deec6bec; 118141ea9d3c608b6c2426cfa8e91e46de5b1986; b2c63506389149ef27c37094bca44fbc9f8970f4; 18fb34cccb5abd7c5b96733dc4c9a3522c93e83d; 371ba767a019b611720da5748de44059b34d6370,,American journal of physiology.

We studied genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) after 5Â days of HFO and after a control diet in 40 young men, of whom 16 had LBW.MethodsmRNA expression was analysed using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays and DNA methylation using Illumina 450K BeadChip arrays.ResultsWe found differential DNA methylation at 53 sites in SAT from LBW vs normal birthweight (NBW) men (false discovery rate <5%), including sites in the FADS2 and CPLX1 genes previously associated with type 2 diabetes. When we used reference-free cell mixture adjustments to potentially adjust for cell composition, 4,323 sites had differential methylation in LBW vs NBW men. However, no differences in SAT gene expression levels were identified between LBW and NBW men. In the combined group of all 40 participants, 3,276 genes (16.5%) were differentially expressed in SAT after HFO (false discovery rate <5%) and there was no difference between LBW men and controls. The most strongly upregulated genes were ELOVL6, FADS2 and NNAT; in contrast, INSR, IRS2 and the SLC27A2 fatty acid transporter showed decreased expression after HFO. Interestingly, SLC27A2 expression correlated negatively with diabetes- and obesity-related traits in a replication cohort of 142 individuals.

Intriguingly, the strongest and most robust epigenetic modifications reported in smokers are altered DNA methylation profiles of AHRR ; however, the functional relevance of these modifications is unclear. Here we integrate AHRR methylation profiles of monocytes (542 CpG sites Â± 150kb of AHRR , using Illumina 450K array) with smoking status and ultrasound measured carotid plaque levels from 1,264 participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), as well as cis -gene expression profiles (Â± 1MB, using RNA sequencing) in a subset (373) of the monocyte samples. Association analysis was adjusted for age, sex, race, study site, and residual sample contamination. RESULTS: Current smoking was associated with methylation of 34 AHRR sites (false discovery rate, FDR -131 ) as previously reported. Over half (59%) of the smoking-associated methylation profiles also correlated with cis -gene expression (of AHRR, EXOC3 , or C5orf55 , FDR AHRR expression was strongly associated with current smoking (p=3.3x10 -21 ). Of the 18 AHRR -associated CpG sites, cg05575921 was most strongly correlated with AHRR expression (corr: -0.42, FDR=4.3x10 -15 ). Cg05575921 methylation profiles also significantly mediated (p=9.1x10 -6 ) the association between current smoking and higher carotid plaque levels. The associations of cg05575921 methylation with smoking (p=0.002) and atherosclerosis (extended fatty streaks, p=0.002) replicated in hepatic biopsies of 141 males (PDAY study). Further characterizing this region, we identified seven CpG sites within 180bp (using RRBS) with methylation correlated with cg05575921, which overlap many predicted regulatory features (in ENCODE and BLUEPRINT monocyte data). CONCLUSIONS: Integration of DNA methylation and RNA sequencing data from ex vivo monocytes revealed a link between the smoking-related methylation of AHRR , induction of AHRR expression, and atherosclerosis. These findings also provide evidence for involvement of the AhR signaling pathway in smoking-related atherogenesis.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Lindsay M Reynolds"", ids = ""34738609""); list(name = ""Ma Wan"", ids = ""36383446""); list(name = ""Jingzhong Ding"", ids = ""2171224""); list(name = ""Jackson Taylor"", ids = ""118197660""); list(name = ""Kurt Lohman"", ids = ""47474803""); list(name = ""R.

3fa867d7aef88d433c766d1b17ddb845ed386fe6,Variation in innate immunity genes and risk of multiple myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B-cell lymphoid malignancy suspected to be associated with immunologic factors. Given recent findings associating single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in innate immunity genes with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, we conducted an investigation of innate immune gene variants using specimens from a population-based case-control study of MM conducted in Connecticut women. Tag SNPs (Nâ€‰=â€‰1461) summarizing common variation in 149 gene regions were genotyped in non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects (103 cases, 475 controls). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) relating SNP associations with MM were computed using unconditional logistic regression, while the MinP test was used to investigate associations with MM at the gene level. We calculated permutation-adjusted P-values and false discovery rates (FDR) to account for the number of comparisons performed in SNP-level and gene-level tests, respectively. Three genes were associated with MM when controlling for a FDR of â‰¤10%: SERPINE1 (P(MinP) â€‰<â€‰0.0001; FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.02), CCR7 (P(MinP) â€‰=â€‰0.0006; FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.06) and HGF (P(MinP) â€‰=â€‰0.001; FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.08). Two SNPs demonstrated robust associations: SERPINE1 rs2227667 (Pâ€‰=â€‰2.1â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-5) , P(permutation) â€‰=â€‰0.03) and HGF rs17501108 (Pâ€‰=â€‰5.0â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-5) , P(permutation) â€‰=â€‰0.07).

9d0e61780a9bfa7ed84909be0e6013e8e9110d84,Common synonymous variants in ABCA4 are protective for chloroquine induced maculopathy (toxic maculopathy),"BackgroundChloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are used to treat auto-immune related diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus. Both drugs however can cause retinal toxicity eventually leading to irreversible maculopathy and retinopathy. Established risk factors are duration and dosage of treatment while the involvement of genetic factors contributing to toxic maculopathy is largely unclear. To address the latter issue, this study aimed to expand on earlier efforts by (1) evaluating risk-altering variants known to be associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a frequent maculopathy in individuals over 55Â years of age, and (2) determining the contribution of genetic variants in the coding sequence of the ABCA4 gene.MethodsThe ABCA4 gene was analyzed by deep sequencing technology using a personal genome machine (Ion Torrent) with 200Â bp read length. Assessment of AMD variants was done by restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products and TaqMan SNP genotyping. Effect sizes, p-values and confidence intervals of common variants were evaluated by logistic regression (Firthâ€™s bias corrected). To account for multiple testing, p-values were adjusted according to the false discovery rate.ResultsWe found no effects of known AMD-associated variants on the risk of toxic maculopathy. In contrast, we report a statistically significant association of common variants in the ABCA4 gene with retinal disease, assessed by a score-based variance-component test (PSKATâ€‰=â€‰0.0055). This association remained significant after adjustment for environmental factors like age and duration of medication and was driven by three common variants in ABCA4 (c.5682Gâ€‰>â€‰C, c.5814Aâ€‰>â€‰G, c.5844Aâ€‰>â€‰G), all conferring a reduced risk for toxic maculopathy.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that minor alleles of common genetic variants in ABCA4 significantly reduce susceptibility to develop toxic maculopathy under CQ treatment. A refined risk profile based on genetic and environmental factors may have implications for revised recommendations in CQ as well as HCQ treatment.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Felix Grassmann"", ids = ""2566960""); list(name = ""Richard Bergholz"", ids = ""7568383""); list(name = ""Julia MÃ¤ndl"", ids = ""48109618""); list(name = ""Herbert Jaegle"", ids = ""6609568""); list(name = ""Klaus Ruether"", ids = ""47878499""); list(name = ""Bernhard HF Weber"", ids = ""153641986"")",fb6660659306126b5577abd90984ced930bf57a6; fa921a3d7127d24055a50017099bcd2c80ebf113; c12aa737a94ddca4f74f7f03731f94d5466bf35e; 006ccb9840037e4891b7bc4e8211a547b6f3a296; a7758af97b6e43f00a0716479795be0e9eac452a; 4e3a79fe2d46e9fa578c36ba078d1a3c063cc70d; 236a6fa887d7056d3584b9fa27ca8190f0d665aa; 5d28385a6a19ae228333df0368ba69f54ca68c94,f87d3088d1a2a2085ba0dbf776880c21a9f9a907; 57790aa69b1206826f4fe03b81b794a6f7195281; 0a29b7d7cb12f39ce4e38fb72cb0339797cbcbf3; c586d33e1b0c71970bd876649b9f3d8f0b2341e0; 457567cda015c5b5a79363fb6cab8c70e41b632c; a4c9fd120d2e07a2d3d2625ee1e96d2037ecbe69; 192c63bf0f792e203b3d7c6814d23ba56e9ff438; 526f438f26278d36cd1577bd3fae6ca02e4696aa; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; fca2c4a2960d9560c041b7e259205b65a41f9a42; 945f38f4f8c9168b141399b785cd0038eb59ba20; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 8d81b3fe7299d5e8652c5d6113a1e5b83417b290; 48da7c12650ecf68806e934fe19fff767a195fd7; 5335d395c964374b372d7671ab27391f416e4526; 8ad6d62de4c874955a16df1dbf8963c53278f6a6; 180dbef48dbc8284956bf72326841e4d2a68e680; 50b8e1ac8936c864fbe155bc4ec3dbd61b5beab4; 69f2c2d92f0ba654d4e94064fa9f6415c5ef892f; 46a73debca49b57e43642eedf21da7238a1f60d5; da13cc1c98ea30cd87da9c8502697a2613b012c7; e8157053b6c399265780e1ad23d5b6a5500c6430; b0cdd840ab8ac9717a8dc69e05c8bd1eb41256e0; 1199314243c650cb3d36fedec7b9e7e6bb2569da; fbfe711cb62db956aec2d477cff0e72f0f0d3cdb; 1583f9ecb36312e70aa34b0782b4c7583c1c9815; 1737a9b0fed8ababff82ff79f4cd03d15ee28d25; 7e584c3ba262a5bf0f4c71cb93b74d6ddef7c873,BMC Ophthalmology,15,
837fcd626bf34f62fc75a0bcfc28937ee6ab7528,Frontal and right temporal activations correlate negatively with depression severity during verbal fluency task: a multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy study.,"Multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive, on-the-spot, functional neuroimaging technique allowing detection of the spatiotemporal characteristics of brain activity. Previous NIRS studies indicated the oxy-hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) increase during a verbal fluency task (VFT) is attenuated in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) as compared with healthy controls. However, the possible relationship between depression symptom severity and oxy-Hb change on NIRS has not yet been elucidated. To examine this relationship, we recruited 30 patients with MDD and 30 age-, gender- and intelligence quotient-matched controls. All underwent NIRS during VFT. As expected, the oxy-Hb increase during the task was significantly smaller in patients than in controls. After false discovery rate correction using 31 channels, the mean increase in oxy-Hb during the task showed a significant negative correlation with the total score of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 21-item version (ch25: rhoÂ =Â -.56; FDR-corrected p: .001). When each item of the HAM-D21 was examined individually, insomnia early in 9 channels (rhoÂ =Â -.63 toÂ -.46; FDR corrected p: .000-.014), work and activity in 2 channels (rhoÂ =Â -.61 toÂ -.57; FDR corrected p: .001 to .003) and psychomotor retardation in 12 channels (rhoÂ =Â -.70 toÂ -.44; FDR corrected p: .000-.018) showed significant negative correlations with the mean oxy-Hb increase in the right frontal temporal region. Although it is possible that our results were affected by medication, these data suggest reduced right frontal temporal activation on NIRS during VFT is related to the symptom severity of MDD.",2012,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Takamasa Noda"", ids = ""2293820""); list(name = ""Sumiko Yoshida"", ids = ""153895961""); list(name = ""Taro Matsuda"", ids = ""153375972""); list(name = ""Nagahisa Okamoto"", ids = ""5111593""); list(name = ""Kota Sakamoto"", ids = ""21547809""); list(name = ""Shunsuke Koseki"", ids = ""49487476""); list(name = ""Yotaro Numachi"", ids = ""38560901""); list(name = ""Eisuke Matsushima"", ids = ""2751604""); list(name = ""Hiroshi Kunugi"", ids = ""2425707""); list(name = ""Teruhiko Higuchi"", ids = ""98323520"")",23bc6ea13bb6930f7482709c92e65bf548856bdc; 10434e598b39e85ed756efa2bb9338a1b8f2b354; 494c47eb69eaf3e0c93945d190a97d1a18e88bf5; 3ec2af3698008879b6ef75b5e7874c6c99043f43; 1ed25b4938a9c57a13d3904442f43daa75bbfe4c; ea1d56595823b167e36f3f98a08b4228655b6611; 7102621abbaeb7ca7c56d838dc4de8bbd4c92f22; e36517d5c7890ee2f1d9b647dde1c09ec0a8b6df; aa4e2024bf381c3257278ecf47f5cf15cec63adf; 7e3cf09f50ab5540d489b2a51b6fa0e177932c91; 05fa9687e6c8b6f18e23e3ac1a44319e5157d8da; b1a99dc68cfc984fe049d3e3d07b307809936248; 6c568e26f3dfdf2c38f4a2946c33222e1e8f7b2f; 42c4152048b1b43a1ea381d297b8e7f5ce442f94; e2c502003d89ab162f050e50b4d4fbea2faa19a4; df1bf734e156f5c13ca241514ec6e1aaa7bbb9d5; 42184171ca0b7cc6dbe64d25838ffd8dcaced464; a677bc6aacb58b2d3b03aff065d99466feb323db; 8f5af8283977362a0141ca3bd0684827b0cc05c3; 81ecf6245007b78e38a91f76b6777b541e7002bc; 6430c7e1d703c8c796b6cfb07f3b5c1e2616179e; 7ab55a3cc5791e4758d9e502b3a98c0b2e3adea3; 18d33d3ba379644c8907c8d54479ff3438ab1768; e40110b067f51814bd78cb8f63c817a5c6055c37; 663ccb15a58f1b641bad2abba53a673fcb1c1bb1; 3ea8a2dafd2464007194d9df3ee986e012222024; 404a6916bfa0669dc52066bf74cf0c600be67d01; 67b827aad29af98818a43b3f3bd099f0dbf965cf; 12976cfbee5c8671442b0fd629ca7a479693007f; 01d2eb5accb96c2891ff6fd9e7fca0cdb81c02e1; 0dbeb012cf2381f749000a919cd03e395bdac8a9; 01e032a1c94d017d43e73e5ef229375861fdaeb7; 058690221174e9fa4d46a5afc79b84b6669239fd; 44210f17cb95b5357344da89a8735dd9a27165b5; 8f1cc92dc997f0406528cd1ab9011c536b42510d; e5fd89d0c8c3f774e0580be39c0e294bdbecf0e0; 02a50f2a013b9a334753adf9f304ed1c61cdfdef; 400ce54cbc20ac1355a961553eb67989196016d0,ff18d2f847a6710ee15b59d85906a3933e1c5bc5; 508fec51fae8cd80db3af746dabb559ba5dad04b; 071a06556535954c1e694707d545464fbd1216e8; 7cae0e2b980ce65ebb8c7d832dcf5e790635014c; f8832e74cc0f0b5f661672fe6f6b9b35109c1dbd; 8c74f1ef012f30f1312235566a88e7a8d9cef01b; d49e7f826618d5684bb8528e63d112933a426831; 444c6335a91965ff45a806a6a63e9c5bca435512; 1d0a795c78212323dc7c1d8e1b756a3009e962e0; c9b046e8275223b4c1e1f47f7d192affca336319; 36285acfc34eeda182e8513ac9fd1514a7d52b2e; 5ddda1f0afb439ef4e292bf8d5d175e71649f6cb; 52cb95c28b661d96d06e049207cf93628196b21d; 10e265b1803cc32e990a3c91a1b3d9458998d1a1; b0db99b3fb1448cc7f56d6dd32d8c7358c1142bb; ea51c9e26fd6c40449a5ffa0e6d8021bc7f91b9d; 98018ee0840e3f5f0707f49ee10c1872ef7f3eb6; 7227e4cb6d183e7bf251c89dfe183e712c882a27; 43e6a53f62f3b3e0597abeb631675c058771a8e6; cefcdacd42949ca687cb7e55d5311b6e6cfeeb44; 102266694b2e7a054e88432fbb4ce76d1f024c05; 8e19e8d7b40a495783aba0f5fa005048a5e78cae; 35333039941b1d78ca9f922fd56e0066a8e7bf61; 8f49caad388ace8ec49b39ff1c41d8fa09917511; de62a55c6bfc1cf7bb9dc0ecd0f0242411bfb8be; 1c0cca1656f097141b3f36d327fafb9749e3ef26; de4b506dc1d5b42cf275a44960dd8c492ae52d89; 15f4dad62acd07cbc9ffe2e9d4092042c4fd73ee; de619a31270998fcbfd62664d5937fbab6f207a4; 6826cc95178006b62f5d05b2486bdb95f41c9ec7; 4d1c8bcd66fef75d99f4c03e0cad3a4a5425b7be; d0a733c5712cbb06863d1ced740e4a528290bd2e; 2a0b98a6d4771b59a497683cc6c1eee1bfe04c4b; e5337ecb0594d1673fac98dceecbde5366b85634; f558e77467ea7963811d68613fde0a3bb25d4a3f; f50b1ffa2cf83a261adc40cc17d9f7544b46ebf2; 3d67f3c43ea535f1a448a4ab9eebdda07b9b741e; 6d4f6782c282df5d833cffa29fec3bd81b3f1172; 99b8bacd586df123c0bef5ca55871c6b9a3fe193; adc42c6bddea0ffa490c3aca72d1ddd97530e793; 84efb87238a6df502b9970f522bad3f874d95058; 503ee8966030eec0c597907745e46a4043afc6ab; 500130ca09437bea168569d44769b2eb762ad036; af7dfa7d3bf069e4da9f4fcfbd5d5d8333f17438; 0c07de120cc627362782187d9ea76c9904237410; b1dcecebb5c30acc600d7b9740e0a1bb36b8fb6e; 38e6c7fa948b26463d9c05588c8c9da1d1151fa9; 1500c26297611ac3ba8116ddfa7ad37b191a2c47; 66a6a5570cf17729b9f023683ddccf804ef3c3a5; 9e4eccea4e618a99583c0f24fd4b99b369e0e498; ea4c08baecda0df405b44ca74a173e872e00c4d8; f0adc95f72896407850856d183f73d94d0ffc33c; 3a0a3cd1d3aa9510dc06b93bc437330160abcff1; 66f31c5781e8d77139bde2d30cde4b4a8c925ae6,Journal of psychiatric research,46 7,"

Data from 56 consecutively treated, NAM-prepared, Caucasian patients with non-syndromic UCLP from a single US cleft palate center were compared to pooled center data based on 56 patients with non-syndromic UCLP treated at 2 Eurocleft centers that did not use presurgical infant orthopedics (non-PSIO). Lateral cephalograms were obtained and 28 landmarks were identified. Published cephalometric measurements from Eurocleft centers were used for comparison. Seven cephalometric measurements (SNA, SNB, ANB, A'N'B', G'-Sn'-Pg', Sn-CT-LS, ANS-Me/N-Me%), available or derivable for both centers, were analyzed. Means and standard deviations for the 7 measurements were calculated for the NAM center. Student's t-tests were used to compare group means for 6 of the measures and a test of proportion was used for ANS-Me/N-Me%. No significant differences were found between the NAM protocol-prepared group and the Eurocleft non-PSIO centers on any of the 7 analyzed cephalometric relationships after accounting for false discovery rate.

eb5584650c72156d09c85e764a6082a423209fc0,A transcriptomal analysis of bovine oviductal epithelial cells collected during the follicular phase versus the luteal phase of the estrous cycle,"BackgroundReproductive success depends on a functional oviduct for gamete storage, maturation, fertilization, and early embryonic development. The ovarian-derived steroids estrogen and progesterone are key regulators of oviductal function. The objective of this study was to investigate luteal and follicular phase-specific oviductal epithelial cell function by using microarray-based transcriptional profiling, to increase our understanding of mRNAs regulating epithelial cell processes, and to identify novel genes and biochemical pathways that may be found to affect fertility in the future.MethodsSix normally cycling Angus heifers were assigned to either luteal phase (LP, nâ€‰=â€‰3) or follicular phase (FP, nâ€‰=â€‰3) treatment groups. Heifers in the LP group were killed between day 11 and 12 after estrus. Heifers in the FP group were treated with 25Â mg PGF2Î± (Lutalyse, Pfizer, NY) at 8Â pm on day 6 after estrus and killed 36Â h later. Transcriptional profiling by microarray and confirmation of selected mRNAs by real-time RT-PCR analyses was performed using total RNA from epithelial cells isolated from sections of the ampulla and isthmus collected from LP and FP treatment groups. Differentially expressed genes were subjected to gene ontology classification and bioinformatic pathway analyses.ResultsStatistical one-way ANOVA using Benjamini-hochberg multiple testing correction for false discovery rate (FDR) and pairwise comparison of epithelial cells in the ampulla of FP versus LP groups revealed 972 and 597 transcripts up- and down-regulated, respectively (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Within epithelial cells of the isthmus in FP versus LP groups, 946 and 817 transcripts were up- and down-regulated, respectively (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Up-regulated genes from both ampulla and isthmus were found to be largely involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and cell cycle pathways, while down-regulated genes were found in numerous inflammatory response pathways.ConclusionsMicroarray-based transcriptional profiling revealed phase of the cycle-dependent changes in the expression of mRNA within the epithelium of the oviductsâ€™ ampulla and isthmus.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Katheryn L.

Psoriasis vulgaris is an inflammatory skin disease mediated by Th1 and Th17 cytokines, yet the relative contribution of interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 on disease pathogenesis is still unknown.


OBJECTIVES
In this study, we sought to identify the cytokines produced by skin-resident T cells in normal skin, localize the receptors for these cytokines, and examine how these cytokines alter gene expression profiles of the cells bearing cognate receptors.


METHODS
We used intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry to evaluate T cell cytokine production, and immunohistochemistry and double-label immunofluorescence to localize cytokine receptors in skin. Gene array analysis of cytokine-treated keratinocytes was performed using moderated paired t-test controlling for false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.


RESULTS
We demonstrate that T-helper cells producing IL-17, IL-22 and/or IFN-gamma, as well as the cells bearing cognate cytokine receptors, are present in normal human skin. Keratinocytes stimulated with IL-17 expressed chemokines that were different from those induced by IFN-gamma, probably contributing to the influx of neutrophils, dendritic cells and memory T cells into the psoriatic lesion. In contrast, IL-22 downregulated genes associated with keratinocyte differentiation and caused epidermal alterations in an organotypic skin model.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that the Th17 cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 mediate distinct downstream pathways that contribute to the psoriatic phenotype: IL-17 is more proinflammatory, while IL-22 retards keratinocyte differentiation.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Kristine E.

This study explored the relationship between weight or height and development of persistent islet autoimmunity and progression to type 1 diabetes during the first 4 years of life in 7,468 children at genetic risk for type 1 diabetes followed in Finland, Germany, Sweden, and the U.S. Growth data collected every third month were used to estimate individual growth curves by mixed models. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate body size and risk of islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes. In the overall cohort, development of islet autoimmunity (n = 575) was related to weight z scores at 12 months (hazard ratio [HR] 1.16 per 1.14 kg in males or per 1.02 kg in females, 95% CI 1.06-1.27, P < 0.001, false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.008) but not at 24 or 36 months. A similar relationship was seen between weight z scores and development of multiple islet autoantibodies (1 year: HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.08-1.35, P = 0.001, FDR = 0.008; 2 years: HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.32, P = 0.004, FDR = 0.02). No association was found between weight or height and type 1 diabetes (n = 169). In conclusion, greater weight in the first years of life was associated with an increased risk of islet autoimmunity.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Helena Elding Larsson"", ids = ""11407796""); list(name = ""Kendra Vehik"", ids = ""2420547""); list(name = ""Michael J Haller"", ids = ""36347958""); list(name = ""Xiang Liu"", ids = ""144518388""); list(name = ""Beena Akolkar"", ids = ""6903981""); list(name = ""William A Hagopian"", ids = ""6452455""); list(name = ""Jeffrey P.

Plusieurs etudes d'association gene candidat ont montre que les SNPs de genes candidats a la reparation d'ADN et au metabolisme des monocarbones (MMC) influencent le risque de CHC et CP. Toutefois, aucune etude n'a evalue, de facon exhaustive, l'influence des SNPs de la reparation d'ADN ou du MMC avec le risque de CP ou de CHC. Notre etude vise a identifier - a l'aide de deux SNP array de 384 SNPs - les polymorphismes genetiques de la reparation d'ADN et du MMC qui sont predictifs du risque de CHC chez des Caucasiens cirrhotiques. Nous avons aussi recherche les determinants genetiques de la reparation d'ADN associes au risque de CP. Nos resultats ont montre que six SNPs du gene BRIP1 (BRCA1interacting protein C?terminal helicase ; rs4986763, rs4986764, rs1557720, rs4986765, rs2191248, et rs11871785) etaient significativement associes au risque de CHC chez les patients porteurs d'une cirrhose d'etiologie virale selon le modele genetique additif.

b4c4092720f3c375d189b4fe7d6cb7e35711e020,Physical activity and prostate gene expression in men with low-risk prostate cancer.,"189 Background: Physical activity (PA), in particular longer duration or higher intensity, may reduce the risk of PCa progression and PCa-specific mortality in men diagnosed with clinically localized PCa. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which PA exerts its protective effect in the prostate remains unknown. We examined the correlation of PA and gene expression patterns in men with low risk prostate cancer who elected to undergo active surveillance.


METHODS
Morphologically normal prostate tissue was obtained from men who subsequently participated in a clinical trial focused on nutritional supplements (previously published microarray dataset #GSE27140). Of the original sample (n=84), 70 completed a brief PA questionnaire and were dichotomized based usual PA [e.g. any vigorous PA (yes/no), 3+ h/wk vigorous PA (yes/no)]. Differential expression and pathway (gene set) analyses between groups were performed using Significance Analysis of Microarrays. Genes and gene sets with a false discovery rate â‰¤0.10 and 0.20 were considered significant, respectively.


RESULTS
Gene expression analysis detected 184 significant genes that were differentially expressed between men who performed vigorous PA for 3+ h/wk (n=23) and those who did not (n= 47). Up-regulated genes included the known tumor suppressors, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Furthermore, pathway analysis revealed that cell cycle and DNA repair pathways were positively modulated in men who participated in 3+h/wk vigorous PA vs. not. Consistent with the data on vigorous PA and clinical outcomes in men with PCa, the duration of vigorous PA was important; there were no significant genes detected when comparing men who participated in any vigorous PA to men who did none.


CONCLUSIONS
Prostate gene expression and pathway analyses revealed candidate genes and in vivo pathways that may be modulated by participating in 3+ h/wk of vigorous PA. These data provide mechanistic insight into how 3+ h/wk of vigorous PA may offer PCa-specific benefits. Furthermore, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which such PA affects normal prostate gene expression may aid the development of strategies to prevent or delay PCa progression.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mark Jesus M Magbanua"", ids = ""3914909""); list(name = ""Erin L.

143914e3137d90bcb72835c01ebde0e344dc98fd,Molecular profiling of Spitz nevi identified by digital RNA counting,"The molecular properties of benign melanocytic lesions are poorly understood. Only a few studies have been carried out on specific nevi subtypes, including common nevocellular nevi (NCN) or Spitz nevi (SN). Genomic alterations in melanoma-associated oncogenes are typically absent in SN. In the present study, mRNA expressions of 25 SN and 15 NCN were analyzed. Molecular profiling was performed using the RNA NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Platform (number of genes=770). Marker discovery was performed with a training set consisting of seven SN and seven NCN samples from the same patients, and validation was performed using a second set consisting of 18 SN and eight NCN samples. Using the training set, 197 differentially expressed genes were identified in SN versus NCN. Of these, 74 genes were validated in the validation set (false discovery rate qâ©½0.13). In addition, using random forest and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator feature selection, a molecular signature of SN versus NCN was identified including 15 top-ranked genes. The present study identified a distinct molecular expression profile in SN compared with NCN, even when lesions were obtained from the same patients. Gene set analysis showed upregulation of gene pathways with increased expression of transcripts related to immunomodulatory, inflammatory, and extracellular matrix interactions as well as angiogenesis-associated processes in SN. These findings strongly indicate that SN represent a distinct group of melanocytic neoplasms and evolve differentially and not sequentially from NCN.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lisa Maria Hillen"", ids = ""6313856""); list(name = ""Milan S.

a590ad27354fbc9f112df748273ad6e9afd41681,Magnetic resonance imaging and molecular features associated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in breast cancer,"BackgroundWe sought to investigate associations between dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer, as well as to study if MRI features are complementary to molecular markers of TILs.MethodsIn this retrospective study, we extracted 17 computational DCE-MRI features to characterize tumor and parenchyma in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰126). The percentage of stromal TILs was evaluated on H&E-stained histological whole-tumor sections. We first evaluated associations between individual imaging features and TILs. Multiple-hypothesis testing was corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg method using false discovery rate (FDR). Second, we implemented LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and linear regression nested with tenfold cross-validation to develop an imaging signature for TILs. Next, we built a composite prediction model for TILs by combining imaging signature with molecular features. Finally, we tested the prognostic significance of the TIL model in an independent cohort (I-SPY 1; nâ€‰=â€‰106).ResultsFour imaging features were significantly associated with TILs (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 and FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.2), including tumor volume, cluster shade of signal enhancement ratio (SER), mean SER of tumor-surrounding background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), and proportion of BPE. Among molecular and clinicopathological factors, only cytolytic score was correlated with TILs (Ïâ€‰=â€‰0.51; 95% CI, 0.36â€“0.63; Pâ€‰=â€‰1.6E-9). An imaging signature that linearly combines five features showed correlation with TILs (Ïâ€‰=â€‰0.40; 95% CI, 0.24â€“0.54; Pâ€‰=â€‰4.2E-6). A composite model combining the imaging signature and cytolytic score improved correlation with TILs (Ïâ€‰=â€‰0.62; 95% CI, 0.50â€“0.72; Pâ€‰=â€‰9.7E-15). The composite model successfully distinguished low vs high, intermediate vs high, and low vs intermediate TIL groups, with AUCs of 0.94, 0.76, and 0.79, respectively. During validation (I-SPY 1), the predicted TILs from the imaging signature separated patients into two groups with distinct recurrence-free survival (RFS), with log-rank Pâ€‰=â€‰0.042 among triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The composite model further improved stratification of patients with distinct RFS (log-rank Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0008), where TNBC with no/minimal TILs had a worse prognosis.ConclusionsSpecific MRI features of tumor and parenchyma are associated with TILs in breast cancer, and imaging may play an important role in the evaluation of TILs by providing key complementary information in equivocal cases or situations that are prone to sampling bias.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jia Wu"", ids = ""47875805""); list(name = ""Xuejie Li"", ids = ""50079134""); list(name = ""Xiaodong Teng"", ids = ""37320703""); list(name = ""Daniel L.

b7ba9ab6f79504aa4a4398ed8ef4f81375d19d0f,Cervical and thoracic intervertebral disc hydration increases with recumbency: a study in 101 healthy volunteers.,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT
Variation in the water content and the size of lumbar intervertebral discs (IVDs) is known to occur because of recumbency and has been associated with lumbar IVD herniation risk through the impact of IVD hydration on tissue mechanical properties. It is not clear if similar changes in cervical or thoracic IVDs occur with recumbency.


PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to determine whether increases in hydration of thoracic and cervical IVDs occur with short-duration recumbency.


STUDY DESIGN/SETTING
This study used a test-retest design in a magnetic resonance imaging facility.


METHODS
We examined expansion of all IVDs in the spine in 101 healthy individuals (54 women) aged 25-35 years on sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance images after a mean of 26.9 minutes lying in the scanner bore. All scans were performed after midday. To mitigate false positives, p-values were adjusted by the false discovery rate method.


RESULTS
At the end of lying, the cervical spine IVD volume increased by a mean (standard deviation) of 2.6 (5.6)% (p<.001) compared with a 1.0 (4.0)% (p=.024) increase in the upper thoracic spine IVD volume and a 2.0 (3.2)% (p<.001) increase at the lower thoracic spine. Lumbar IVD volume increased by 1.2 (2.4)% (p<.001). C2-C3 IVD volume (+4.1 [13.8]%, p=.011) increased the most at the cervical spine, followed by C5-C6 (+3.9 [9.8]%, p<.001) and C3-C4 (+3.8 [13.5]%, p=.014). Lumbar IVDs with higher degeneration grades showed more expansion with lying (p=.0031).


CONCLUSIONS
We established that cervical and thoracic IVD volumes increase with recumbency. We expect diurnal variation in cervical and thoracic IVD hydration will occur in the general population, with greater cervical and thoracic IVD hydration and size upon rising in the morning.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel L BelavÃ½"", ids = ""3353250""); list(name = ""Matthew Quittner"", ids = ""10381927""); list(name = ""Yuan Ling"", ids = ""50418084""); list(name = ""David A.

0ab8dbc0dc0a12491bd1aaac71ba9f9f39bceab2,Global effects of vitamin A deficiency on gene expression in rat liver: evidence for hypoandrogenism.,"Vitamin A (retinol) metabolites are ligands for transcription factors that regulate many genes. The liver is the main storage depot for retinol and plays a role in vitamin A homeostasis. To better understand the effects of vitamin A deficiency on liver gene expression, we produced retinol deficiency in male rats by feeding a diet low in retinol for 53 days after weaning and examined the effects on gene expression in liver using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays. We detected expression of 41% of the 8799 probe sets represented on the RGU-34A GeneChips. Vitamin A deficiency resulted in major changes in liver gene expression: 805 genes (22% of all genes detected) differed at P<or=.05 (false discovery rate <0.143). Genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, peroxisomal function, glycolysis, glutamate metabolism and the urea cycle were altered. The expression of many sexually dimorphic genes was altered toward a feminized or senescent pattern of gene expression in the liver. Retinol deficiency also produces a shift toward increased protein and fat catabolism and decreased fatty acid synthesis.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jeanette N.

1891301561f87c18a745f874ee44bdcccc1548bb,Associations between objectively measured and self-reported sleep with academic and cognitive performance in adolescents: DADOS study.,"Adequate sleep has been positively related with health and school achievement outcomes during adolescence. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of objectively measured and self-reported sleep duration and quality with academic and cognitive performance in adolescents. This study was conducted with 257 adolescents (13.9â€…Â±â€…0.3â€…years) from the DADOS study (Deporte, ADOlescencia y Salud). Objectively measured and self-reported sleep duration and quality were obtained by a wrist-worn GENEActiv accelerometer and the Spanish version of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire, respectively. Academic performance was analysed through school records using four indicators: math, language, science and grade point average score. Cognitive performance was measured using the Spanish version of the ""SRA Test of Educational Ability"". After Benjamini-Hochberg correction for the false discovery rate, objectively measured sleep duration was negatively associated with verbal ability (Î²â€…=â€…-0.179, pâ€…=â€….004), whilst self-reported sleep quality was positively associated with academic performance (Î² ranging from 0.209 to 0.273; all pâ€…<â€….001). These associations remained significant after further controlling for physical fitness and physical activity. Conversely, there were no associations between self-reported sleep duration and objective sleep quality with academic and cognitive performance. Our findings fit in line with previous research showing that sleep quality may play an important role on adolescents' academic performance. Further interventional research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which sleep is related to academic performance in youth.",2019,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Mireia Adelantado-Renau"", ids = ""1400969480""); list(name = ""Maria Reyes Beltran-Valls"", ids = ""1400969427""); list(name = ""Jairo H.

To better characterize solid ACC, we performed a clinical, morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular comparative analysis of 33 ACCs of the breast comprising 17 solid variant ACCs and 16 conventional ACCs. Solid ACCs displayed basaloid morphology with an exclusive or predominant epithelial cell population associated with decreased myoepithelial differentiation, while demonstrating MYB protein overexpression similar to the more common type of ACC. Strong and diffuse MYB expression by immunochemistry was observed in 14/17 (82%) of solid ACCs while MYB rearrangements were detected by break apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in only 3/16 (19%) of solid ACCs. Conversely, weak MYB immunohistochemical expression was observed in only 7/204 (3%) of TNBC. Solid ACCs displayed a transcriptomic profile distinct from conventional ACCs with 549 genes showing a highly significant differential expression between conventional and solid ACC [false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.01; log2FCâ€‰>â€‰|1|]. EnrichR and Kegg Pathway analyses identified PI3K-Akt and focal adhesion signaling pathways as significantly overexpressed in conventional ACCs compared with solid ACCs which significantly overexpressed the nitrogen metabolism pathway. CREBBP mutations and NOTCH activating gene mutations were only present in solid ACCs, concerning 5/16 (31%) of cases for each gene. Tumors with NOTCH activating mutations displayed a strong diffuse nuclear NICD1 staining, an established marker of Notch pathway activation. Solid ACCs also differed from basal-type TNBC, with fewer TP53 mutations and a more stable genomic profile on array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). In summary, solid-type ACC of the breast is a distinct molecular entity within the ACC family and is different from common basal-type TNBC. MYB is a diagnostically useful biomarker of solid ACC and NOTCH could be a novel potential therapeutic target in 30% of cases.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Julie MassÃ©"", ids = ""1471135271""); list(name = ""Caroline Truntzer"", ids = ""49340712""); list(name = ""Romain Boidot"", ids = ""5884546""); list(name = ""Emmanuel Khalifa"", ids = ""1471135285""); list(name = ""GaÃ«lle PÃ©rot"", ids = ""4292611""); list(name = ""ValÃ©rie VÃ©lasco"", ids = ""144647147""); list(name = ""LaÃ©titia Mayeur"", ids = ""79447978""); list(name = ""Claire Billerey-Larmonier"", ids = ""1471133805""); list(name = ""Larry Blanchard"", ids = ""1471129786""); list(name = ""HÃ©lÃ¨ne Charitansky"", ids = ""1471133748""); list(name = ""Isabelle Soubeyran"", ids = ""5906532""); list(name = ""Richard D.

8ee93549fba84e0f53be1f3a7c83396978641180,Distributions of ion series in ETD and CID spectra: making a comparison.,"Databases which capture proteomic data for subsequent interrogation can be extremely useful for our understanding of peptide ion behaviour in the mass spectrometer, leading to novel hypotheses and mechanistic understanding of the underlying mechanisms determining peptide fragmentation behaviour. These, in turn, can be used to improve database searching algorithms for use in automated and unbiased interpretation of peptide product ion spectra. Here, we examine a previously published dataset using our established methods, in order to discover differences in the observation of product ions of different types, following ion activation and unimolecular dissociation either by collisional dissociation or the ion/ion reaction, electron transfer dissociation. Using a target-decoy database searching strategy, a large data set of precursor ions, were confidently predicted as peptide sequence matches (PSMs) at either a 1% or 5% peptide false discovery rate, as reported in our previous study. Using these high quality PSMs, we have conducted a more detailed and novel analysis of the global trends in observed product ions present/absent in these spectra, examining both CID and ETD data. We uncovered underlying trends for an increased propensity for the observation of higher members of the ion series in ETD product ion spectra in comparison to their CID counterparts. Such data-mining efforts will prove useful in the generation of new database searching algorithms which are well suited to the analysis of ETD product ion spectra.",2011,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sarah R.

bc571292a67bf17ccf10dfaa238923fcd1cd8389,Genome-wide pathway analysis identifies VEGF pathway association with oral ulceration in systemic lupus erythematosus,"BackgroundSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a genetically complex rheumatic disease characterized by heterogeneous clinical manifestations of unknown etiology. Recent studies have suggested the existence of a genetic basis for SLE heterogeneity. The objective of the present study was to identify new genetic variation associated with the clinically relevant phenotypes in SLE.MethodsA two-stage pathway-based approach was used to identify the genetic variation associated with the main clinical phenotypes in SLE. In the discovery stage, 482 SLE patients were genotyped using Illumina Human Quad610 microarrays. Association between 798 reference genetic pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database and 11 SLE phenotypes was tested using the set-based method implemented in PLINK software. Pathways significantly associated after multiple test correction were subsequently tested for replication in an independent cohort of 425 SLE patients. Using an in silico approach, we analyzed the functional effects of common SLE therapies on the replicated genetic pathways. The association of known SLE risk variants with the development of the clinical phenotypes was also analyzed.ResultsIn the discovery stage, we found a significant association between the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway and oral ulceration (P value for false discovery rate (PFDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05), and between the negative regulation signaling pathway of retinoic acid inducible gene-I/melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 and the production of antinuclear antibodies (PFDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05). In the replication stage, we validated the association between the VEGF pathway and oral ulceration. Therapies commonly used to treat mucocutaneous phenotypes in SLE were found to strongly influence VEGF pathway gene expression (Pâ€‰=â€‰4.60e-4 to 5.38e-14). Analysis of known SLE risk loci identified a strong association between PTPN22 and the risk of hematologic disorder and with the development of antinuclear antibodies.ConclusionsThe present study has identified VEGF genetic pathway association with the risk of oral ulceration in SLE. New therapies targeting the VEGF pathway could be more effective in reducing the severity of this phenotype. These findings represent a first step towards the understanding of the genetic basis of phenotype heterogeneity in SLE.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""AdriÃ  Aterido"", ids = ""4824572""); list(name = ""Antonio JuliÃ "", ids = ""145071178""); list(name = ""Patricia Carreira"", ids = ""5126415""); list(name = ""Ricardo Blanco"", ids = ""120794092""); list(name = ""JosÃ© Javier LÃ³pez-Longo"", ids = ""1404972031""); list(name = ""JosÃ© Javier PÃ©rez Venegas"", ids = ""10126367""); list(name = ""Ã\200lex OlivÃ©"", ids = ""77268129""); list(name = ""JosÃ© Luis Andreu"", ids = ""40509232""); list(name = ""MarÃ­a Ã\201ngeles Aguirre-Zamorano"", ids = ""1404972013""); list(name = ""Paloma Vela"", ids = ""47806905""); list(name = ""Joan Miquel Nolla"", ids = ""80055533""); list(name = ""JosÃ© LuÃ­s Marenco-de la Fuente"", ids = ""1404971996""); list(name = ""Antonio Zea"", ids = ""8094557""); list(name = ""JosÃ© MarÃ­a Pego"", ids = ""46349882""); list(name = ""Mercedes Freire"", ids = ""123332587""); list(name = ""Elvira DÃ­ez"", ids = ""1404291271""); list(name = ""MarÃ­a LÃ³pez-Lasanta"", ids = ""1404971957""); list(name = ""Mireia LÃ³pez-Corbeto"", ids = ""1404971967""); list(name = ""N.

7c8cc5af0fc1be8f7651b3e4daac9cae9c0a8094,Chemical Denaturation and Protein Precipitation Approach for Discovery and Quantitation of Protein-Drug Interactions.,"Described here is a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach for the large-scale analysis of protein-drug interactions. The approach involves the evaluation of ligand-induced protein folding free energy changes (Î”Î” Gf) using chemical denaturation and protein precipitation (CPP) to identify the protein targets of drugs and to quantify protein-drug binding affinities. This is accomplished in a chemical denaturant-induced unfolding experiment where the folded and unfolded protein fractions in each denaturant containing buffer are quantified by the amount of soluble or precipitated protein (respectively) that forms upon abrupt dilution of the chemical denaturant and subsequent centrifugation of the sample. In the proof-of-principle studies performed here, the CPP technique was able to identify the well-known protein targets of cyclosporin A and geldanamycin in a yeast. The technique was also used to identify protein targets of sinefungin, a broad-based methyltransferase inhibitor, in a human MCF-7 cell lysate. The CPP technique also yielded dissociation constant ( Kd) measurements for these well-studied drugs that were in general agreement with previously reported Kd or IC50 values. In comparison to a similar energetics-based technique, termed stability of proteins from rates of oxidation (SPROX), the CPP technique yielded significantly better (âˆ¼50% higher) proteomic coverage and a largely reduced false discovery rate.",2018,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""He Meng"", ids = ""46490273""); list(name = ""Renze Ma"", ids = ""15888225""); list(name = ""Michael C Fitzgerald"", ids = ""22229779"")",,,Analytical chemistry,90 15,"

5bc474d70dd678e24d0406d305e34f0be31249b7,Input permutation method to detect active voxels in fMRI study.,"Correctly identifying voxels or regions of interest (ROI) that actively respond to a given stimulus is often an important objective/step in many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. In this article, we study a nonparametric method to detect active voxels, which makes minimal assumption about the distribution of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Our proposal has several interesting features. It uses time lagged correlation to take into account the delay in response to the stimulus, due to hemodynamic variations. We introduce an input permutation method (IPM), a type of block permutation method, to approximate the null distribution of the test statistic. Also, we propose to pool the permutation-derived statistics of preselected voxels for a better approximation to the null distribution. Finally, we control multiple testing error rate using the local false discovery rate (FDR) by Efron [Correlation and large-scale simultaneous hypothesis testing.

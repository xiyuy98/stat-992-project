Eight purpose-bred intact male hound cross research dogs were enrolled and randomized to groups based on variables of pressure/body position (n=4) and insufflation time (n=4). For each segment of large bowel (rectum, colorectal junction, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon), the adequacy of bowel preparation, % of bowel lumen filled with fecal material, and bowel tortuosity or folding were assessed. Measurements of bowel wall thickness (cm), cross-sectional bowel lumen diameter (cm), and cross-sectional bowel luminal area (cm2) were obtained at standardized locations within the large bowel. False discovery rates (FDR) were calculated to adjust for multiple testing. Values of FDR < 0.05 were considered significant. Differences in mean cross-sectional area and diameter and bowel wall thickness under increasing pressure were not significant after adjusting for multiple testing; some had raw p values <0.05. Ascending colon diameter and ascending colon area significantly increased with insufflation time (FDR<0.05). No other response variables showed a significant change with insufflation time. The optimal insufflation pressure for maintaining pneumocolon in this study was determined to be 20 mmHg. CTP is a feasible technique to provide consistent distension for imaging of the large bowel and further study on application of CTP in clinical patients is warranted.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Michele A Steffey"", ids = ""4025120""); list(name = ""Leticia Daniel"", ids = ""16814558""); list(name = ""Sandra L.

616593f542e93bb67afe437499ad00d49c04d1a7,Choice Impact of Soft Analysis Tools in Genes Selection,"Motivation: In the analysis of experiments that involves the high density of oligonucleotide chips, it is important to generate list of genes or â€˜targetsâ€™ from the genomewide data set that contains a lot of information. Gene selection is a process that seeks to identify the most significant genes which reveal large expression changes between the baseline experiments and the conditions. Even though, several algortithms like T-test and other derived statistical algorithms were used for that selection process, the suitable Pvalue Cutoff remains difficult to choose. Therefore, one solution consists of using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. The Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) and the T-test Benjamini & Hochberg (BH) algorithms have been successfully used in such way. However, the reproductivity of results and their impact on the genes and/or experiments classification, while using different soft tools remain a subject of discussion. Method: we use two Affymetrix data sets, when we look for identifying list of genes under SAM and T-test-BH algorithms with FDR control runing under R/Bioconductor project and Bioinformtics ToolBox of Mathworks. Results: The list of selected genes changes significantly when using the two algorithms under both R/Bioconductor project and Bioinformtics ToolBox of Mathworks. By means of data provided from publicly databases, we illustrate, that the permutation process of the multiple statistical T-test (SAM and BH) may affect results of selection process. Moreover, list of genes using the two Soft is affected by the choice of the Pvalue-CutOff for identifyng true differential expressed genes. According to this work, we present some results clarifying sensitivity and efficiency of used soft and its influence in gene selection process. Hierarchical classification of selected genes and corresponding experiences confirm the influence of both methods and tools on the outcome of gene expression data analysis.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Ouafae Kaissi"", ids = ""2383249""); list(name = ""Ahmed Moussa"", ids = ""144050363""); list(name = ""Brigitte Vannier"", ids = ""48719341""); list(name = ""Abdellatif Amrani Ghacham"", ids = ""2596699"")",,7d0fdb068e651d1c9f35703cbb23d262f5af0b7d; c2164e330f7dca21de4d46a62aabfac2c1d60700; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f197cde2ebca64dfdb3b6e13ff0b71200de755af; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; 5d348ad224e80634f848a475367d234829609394; f2b2a64a372b0f1767118286325956afbfedfda5; 69bed2297d6ac9c6d270424fbad7e2d2ace37a2e; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; ad6b19a494a65706d81e67ae7aab743a71ecb487; 081705de995829506625b81696cb0730a912c51f; 9006dc724be0ca379d9a62b617c7d415bcc60846; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; bd37ef00c998eac4230e57521498b02cdb2b416f; a6cd66298e0a34d7355d24f317ded58e32d9912c,,,185-191

Its emphasis is on usability and integration of the best analytic tools. SPIRE provides an easy to use web-interface and generates results in both interactive and simple data formats. In contrast to run-based approaches, SPIRE conducts the analysis based on the experimental design. It employs novel methods to generate false discovery rates and local false discovery rates (FDR, LFDR) and integrates the best and complementary open-source search and data analysis methods. The SPIRE approach of integrating X!Tandem, OMSSA and SpectraST can produce an increase in protein IDs (52-88%) over current combinations of scoring and single search engines while also providing accurate multi-faceted error estimation. One of SPIRE's primary assets is combining the results with data on protein function, pathways and protein expression from model organisms. We demonstrate some of SPIRE's capabilities by analyzing mitochondrial proteins from the wild type and 3 mutants of C. elegans. SPIRE also connects results to publically available proteomics data through its Model Organism Protein Expression Database (MOPED).

fa6fee19bba9af30496a33e071c73f783d57318d,Deep coverage of the Escherichia coli proteome enables the assessment of false discovery rates in simple proteogenomic experiments.,"Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS) have led to increased applications of shotgun proteomics to the refinement of genome annotation. The typical ""proteo-genomic"" workflows rely on the mapping of peptide MS/MS spectra onto databases derived via six-frame translation of the genome sequence. These databases contain a large proportion of spurious protein sequences which make the statistical confidence of the resulting peptide spectrum matches difficult to assess. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of the Escherichia coli proteome using LTQ-Orbitrap MS and mapped the corresponding MS/MS spectra onto a six-frame translation of the E. coli genome. We hypothesized that the protein-coding part of the E. coli genome approaches complete annotation and that the majority of six frame-specific (novel) peptide spectrum matches can be considered as false positive identifications. We confirm our hypothesis by showing that the posterior error probability distribution of novel hits is almost identical to that of reversed (decoy) hits; this enables us to estimate the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and false discovery rate in a typical bacterial proteo-genomic dataset. We use two complementary computational frameworks for processing and statistical assessment of MS/MS data: MaxQuant and Trans-Proteomic Pipeline. We show that MaxQuant achieves a more sensitive six-frame database search with an acceptable false discovery rate and is therefore well suited for global genome reannotation applications, whereas the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline achieves higher specificity and is well suited for high-confidence validation. The use of a small and well-annotated bacterial genome enables us to address genome coverage achieved in state-of-the-art bacterial proteomics: identified peptide sequences mapped to all expressed E. coli proteins but covered 31.7% of the protein-coding genome sequence. Our results show that false discovery rates can be substantially underestimated even in ""simple"" proteo-genomic experiments obtained by means of high-accuracy MS and point to the necessity of further improvements concerning the coverage of peptide sequences by MS-based methods.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Karsten Krug"", ids = ""40329575""); list(name = ""Alejandro Carpy"", ids = ""39885817""); list(name = ""Gesa Behrends"", ids = ""48780879""); list(name = ""Katarina MatiÄ‡"", ids = ""46905181""); list(name = ""Nelson C Soares"", ids = ""143802108""); list(name = ""Boris MaÄ\215ek"", ids = ""2501563"")",603a684b780d30d9e5128248f78f145b29bb77e4; 46eec7f0283e99cee183283d2d783d066a4c3dc0; 58ba650d1fb0112b6c3f2f5102a023f2c1d85071; 5978f9bd0118de25d87aab973766c8bb31303b5e; d3d8d63c2490a68b13de13fc6c55ab08ecac0d64; 7e7ed39ac1ae39af7f508d1b1598a9cbd0c21aec; ffd4535447be9e79665947fb7b2816f4aa905671; bdf941b1af86214a11872936138db1a4a9b65893; 2e106bf576ecbf343223edbbac42cd4d4e71159a; e6fe05a057beeec996a10153f013b60ca27aedce; 63f3f9f8f4a3653cd3267b5b4435657b2bb3184d; d22d978389210f99ceb6ec0a657146eee3eb277a; 8162db1c886147b964a9c68b4da0e70b7bca298f; 97c0baf3cd3e0b64bbdb9041d8a229ccdcb82b11; 8cdd128e5b86cb42cf42885808c445e8fe55d131; 84582f348bc5298c42e9a30cecd2388d6b2d16d0; 80460e5bfb26591b1649d876615c564714bf021f; 3c09d4d7c5dbdacfb21e8d11b595e9f15096ee6b; 13afdd25fd64c5979652157eb11e0d86eecfe4c1; aa3cc8d08f7e0b7c30b6fa5bd848f60851b884a1; b9f956cb2e3395c180d9a90f507c535fe8dcc655; 49efa1241fef27723539658007019331f3f059d8; 94d8f441ffe3555c075e06d4577ea5d9b556418b; 19ca8390ce34b652ad55497d4c99d5c928c85f49; 4b62fbb307ce5b14b27efa3887e2937cf999bbe6; 21ce2676e7b83342e70aa6ea980240ab009ff0d4; c9c10b6ea8f8356361b89a7de63fc2790c207622; 5f204a2864adf9343d745188ed811ce878e543b3; efa9b89014a3e1b35d14cae74e8672abfe3a09de; 340bf737c823b0263944e662d47cc73b9fcc9c52; 8065561a423df5f6c970178822edb0d1cd99e9cb; 7e632c22632d3f0f2fb84b6c34a32ab73b1b3ec9; 1ac572146685a499314ceda9da6ec53db4ac9489,,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,12 11,"

f414c8960c4af9d53b51fa5187968534d668773d,Extended likelihood approach to large-scale multiple testing,"Summary 
 
To date, only frequentist, Bayesian and empirical Bayes approaches have been studied for the large-scale inference problem of testing simultaneously hundreds or thousands of hypotheses. Their derivations start with some summarizing statistics without modelling the basic responses. As a consequence testing procedures have been developed without necessarily checking model assumptions, and empirical null distributions are needed to avoid the problem of rejecting all null hypotheses when the sample sizes are large. Nevertheless these procedures may not be statistically efficient. We present the multiple-testing problem as a multiple-prediction problem of whether a null hypothesis is true or not. We introduce hierarchical random-effect models for basic responses and show how the extended likelihood is built. It is shown that the likelihood prediction has a certain oracle property. The extended likelihood leads to new testing procedures, which are optimal for the usual loss function in hypothesis testing. The new tests are based on certain shrinkage t-statistics and control the local probability of false discovery for individual tests to maintain the global frequentist false discovery rate and have no need to consider an empirical null distribution for the shrinkage t-statistics. Conditions are given when these false rates vanish. Three examples illustrate how to use the likelihood method in practice. A numerical study shows that the likelihood approach can greatly improve existing methods and finding the best fitting model is crucial for the behaviour of test procedures.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Youngjo Lee"", ids = ""2264093""); list(name = ""Jan F.

b5c22d9f522c5e75eace210e185c10554b4aeea3,Selection-Driven Gene Inactivation in Salmonella.,"Bacterial genes are sometimes found to be inactivated by mutation. This inactivation may be observable simply because selection for function is intermittent or too weak to eliminate inactive alleles quickly. Here I investigate cases in Salmonella enterica where inactivation is instead positively selected. These are identified by a rate of introduction of premature stop codons to a gene that is higher than expected under selective neutrality, as assessed by comparison to the rate of synonymous changes. I identify 84 genes that meet this criterion at a 10% false discovery rate. Many of these genes are involved in virulence, motility and chemotaxis, biofilm formation, and resistance to antibiotics or other toxic substances. It is hypothesized that most of these genes are subject to an ongoing process in which inactivation is favored under rare conditions, but the inactivated allele is deleterious under most other conditions and is subsequently driven to extinction by purifying selection.",2020,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Joshua L.

df42508ab4b41da6ad89dec4974dbc198af439e9,Distributional Property of the Generalized p-value for the Behrens-Fisher Problem with Applications to Multiple Testing,"The generalized p-value method introduced by Tsui and Weerahandi (1989) has been used to successfully provide finite sample solutions for many hypothesis testing problems when no solutions are available using the usual approach. Although simulation studies show that generalized p-values have similar distributional properties as ordinary p-values, no one has yet developed theoretical properties of generalized p-values. This paper provides some theoretical distributional properties of the generalized p-value for the Behrens-Fisher problem of testing the difference of two independent normal distribution means with possibly unequal distributional variances. We show why the probability that the generalized p-value for the Behrens-Fisher problem is less than a given value r in (0, 0.5), is approximately r. We use this theoretical result to obtain a multiple testing procedure based on generalized p-values, which controls the false discovery rate (FDR). In particular, we introduce a theoretically valid testing procedure that controls FDR in simultaneously testing several Behrens-Fisher problems. Our procedure to control FDR is an extension of the important work of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995), which is based on ordinary p-values.

2349dc9bf031308ca83fc1079def44c5754fb141,Use of Score Statistics for Model Selection in Mapping Multiple Quantitative Trait Loci,"One of the major issues in mapping multiple quantitative trait loci is that of model selection. Many methods for mapping QTL scan positions across the genome and test for statistical significance to decide whether to admit QTL in the model. A common problem with these methods is the determination of a genome-wide threshold value for the test statistic. Recently a modeland data-based resampling procedure using score statistics was introduced to empirically calculate the relevant threshold. In this paper we extend the score statistic analysis to multiple interval mapping (MIM) procedure and perform a simulation study to assess the performance of mapping multiple QTL using a sequential MIM search with model selection based on the use of the score statistic threshold. Our results show that this procedure provides an effective, consistent genome-wide threshold for admitting a QTL to be included in an MIM model. We discuss the performance of the procedure with respect to model size, false discovery rate, power to detect QTL, confidence in position estimates, and behavior of parameter estimates. An important result is that when we relax the genome-wide threshold from the nominal 5% significance level to 20% for model selection, the statistical power to detect QTL can be significantly increased and at the same time the false discovery rate is only mildly affected and is well controlled. Based on the simulation result, we recommend the use of genome-wide threshold at 20% significance level calculated from the score resampling method for model selection in mapping multiple QTL.",2008,,"list(name = ""Cecelia Laurie"", ids = ""47535201""); list(name = ""Shengchu Wang"", ids = ""2486415""); list(name = ""Luciana Aparecida Carlini-Garcia"", ids = ""49492589""); list(name = ""Zhao-Bang Zeng"", ids = ""33856320"")",,,,,
d1540c4ba96208d736108771b3f61ced08f272c4,A microarray study on the effect of four hormone therapy regimens on gene transcription in whole blood from healthy postmenopausal women.,"BACKGROUND
Postmenopausal hormone therapy is associated with many diseases and conditions, e.g., cardiovascular diseases and asthma, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of four different postmenopausal hormone therapy regimens on gene transcription.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty-four healthy postmenopausal women (six women in four groups) were randomly allocated to conventional-dose 17Î²-estradiol/norethisterone acetate (NETA), low-dose 17Î²-estradiol/NETA, tibolone, or raloxifene hydrochloride. RNA was isolated from whole blood before and after 6weeks of treatment. The changes in mRNA were assessed with a microarray chip.


RESULTS
The genes FKBP5, IL13RA1, TPST1, and TLR2 were up-regulated and among the most significantly changed genes in the groups treated with conventional-dose 17Î²-estradiol/NETA and tibolone. Up-regulation of TPST1 was associated with reduction of tissue factor pathway inhibitor in plasma. Nine biological pathways were associated with conventional-dose 17Î²-estradiol/NETA, most significantly the pathways for asthma, toll-like receptor signaling, cell adhesion molecules, and MAPK signaling. Transcriptional changes with false discovery rate below 0.10 were found in 10 genes in the conventional-dose 17Î²-estradiol/NETA group, 7 genes in the tibolone group, and zero genes in the women on low-dose 17Î²-estradiol/NETA. No genes or pathways were associated with raloxifene treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
The difference between low-dose and conventional-dose17Î²-estradiol/NETA indicates an effect of dose on transcriptional response. Several genes and pathways related to cell adhesion molecules and immunity related cell surface receptors were influenced by conventional-dose 17Î²-estradiol/NETA.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""A E A Dahm"", ids = ""145526377""); list(name = ""Anette LÃ¸ken Eilertsen"", ids = ""12257439""); list(name = ""Jelle J.

ff59ff087450175e3697d7d7d8b0cadd8ed28d56,Dissecting genetic interactions in complex traits,"Of central importance in the dissection of the components that govern complex traits is understanding the architecture of natural genetic variation. Genetic interaction, or epistasis, constitutes one aspect of this, but epistatic analysis has been largely avoided in genome wide association studies because of statistical and computational difficulties. This thesis explores both issues in the context of two-locus interactions. Initially, through simulation and deterministic calculations it was demonstrated that not only can epistasis maintain deleterious mutations at intermediate frequencies when under selection, but that it may also have a role in the maintenance of additive variance. Based on the epistatic patterns that are evolutionarily persistent, and the frequencies at which they are maintained, it was shown that exhaustive two dimensional search strategies are the most powerful approaches for uncovering both additive variance and the other genetic variance components that are coprecipitated. However, while these simulations demonstrate encouraging statistical benefits, two dimensional searches are often computationally prohibitive, particularly with the marker densities and sample sizes that are typical of genome wide association studies. To address this issue different software implementations were developed to parallelise the two dimensional triangular search grid across various types of high performance computing hardware. Of these, particularly effective was using the massively-multi-core architecture of consumer level graphics cards. While the performance will continue to improve as hardware improves, at the time of testing the speed was 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than CPU based software solutions that are in current use. Not only does this software enable epistatic scans to be performed routinely at minimal cost, but it is now feasible to empirically explore the false discovery rates introduced by the high dimensionality of multiple testing. Through permutation analysis it was shown that the significance threshold for epistatic searches is a function of both marker density and population sample size, and that because of the correlation structure that exists between tests the threshold estimates currently used are overly stringent. Although the relaxed threshold estimates constitute an improvement in the power of two dimensional searches, detection is still most likely limited to relatively large genetic effects. Through direct calculation it was shown that, in contrast to the additive case where the decay of estimated genetic variance was proportional to falling linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and observed markers, for epistasis this decay was exponential. One way to rescue poorly captured causal variants is to parameterise association tests using haplotypes rather than single markers. A novel statistical method that uses a regularised parameter selection procedure on two locus haplotypes was developed, and through extensive simulations it can be shown that it delivers a substantial gain in power over single marker based tests. Ultimately, this thesis seeks to demonstrate that many of the obstacles in epistatic analysis can be ameliorated, and with the current abundance of genomic data gathered by the scientific community direct search may be a viable method to qualify the importance of epistasis.

f86d80a6d34f15d679ef391cdfca2f3fe0b42edf,Integrating Biological Knowledge Into Case-Control Analysis Through Iterated Conditional Modes/Medians Algorithm.,"Logistic regression is an effective tool in case-control analysis. With the advanced high throughput technology, a quest to seek a fast and efficient method in fitting high-dimensional logistic regression has gained much interest. An empirical Bayes model for logistic regression is considered in this article. A spike-and-slab prior is used for variable selection purpose, which plays a vital role in building an effective predictive model while making model interpretable. To increase the power of variable selection, we incorporate biological knowledge through the Ising prior. The development of the iterated conditional modes/medians (ICM/M) algorithm is proposed to fit the logistic model that has computational advantage over Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. The implementation of the ICM/M algorithm for both linear and logistic models can be found in R package icmm that is freely available on Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Simulation studies were carried out to assess the performances of our method, with lasso and adaptive lasso as benchmark. Overall, the simulation studies show that the ICM/M outperform the others in terms of number of false positives and have competitive predictive ability. An application to a real data set from Parkinson's disease study was also carried out for illustration. To identify important variables, our approach provides flexibility to select variables based on local posterior probabilities while controlling false discovery rate at a desired level rather than relying only on regression coefficients.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Vitara Pungpapong"", ids = ""1403573840""); list(name = ""Min Zhang"", ids = ""50495571""); list(name = ""Dabao Zhang"", ids = ""2553667"")",,,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,,
0481ea09b5f9c32212789e6af4ceac46cf29ea3b,Pathway analysis of genome-wide association study for bone mineral density,"The aim of this study was to identify the candidate causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and candidate causal mechanisms that contribute to bone mineral density (BMD) and to generate a SNP to gene to pathway hypothesis using an analytical pathway-based approach. We used hip BMD GWAS data of the genotypes of 301,019 SNPs in 5,715 Europeans. ICSNPathway (identify candidate causal SNPs and pathways) analysis was applied to the BMD GWAS dataset. The first stage involved the pre-selection of candidate causal SNPs by linkage disequilibrium analysis and the functional SNP annotation of the most significant SNPs found. The second stage involved the annotation of biological mechanisms for the pre-selected candidate causal SNPs using improved-gene set enrichment analysis. ICSNPathway analysis identified seven candidate SNPs, eight candidate pathways, and seven hypothetical biological mechanisms. Eight pathways are as follows; gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation (nominal p-valueÂ <Â 0.001, false discovery rate (FDR) <0.001), regulation of the smoothened signaling pathway (nominal p-valueÂ <Â 0.001, FDRÂ =Â 0.016), TACI and BCMA stimulation of B cell immune response (nominal p-valueÂ <Â 0.001, FDRÂ =Â 0.021), endonuclease activity (nominal p-valueÂ =Â 0.001, FDRÂ =Â 0,026), regulation of defense response to virus (nominal p-valueÂ =Â 0.001, FDRÂ =Â 0.028), serine_type_endopeptidase_inhibitor_activity (nominal p-valueÂ =Â 0.001, FDRÂ =Â 0.044), endoribonuclease activity (nominal p-valueÂ =Â 0.002, FDRÂ =Â 0.045), and myeloid leukocyte differentiation (nominal p-valueÂ =Â 0.001, FDRÂ =Â 0.050). The most significant causal pathway was gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation. CYP3A5, PON2, PON3, CMBL, PON1, ALPL, CYP3A43, CYP3A7, ACP6, ACPP, and ALPI (pÂ <Â 0.05) are involved in the pathway of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation. Further examination of the gene contents revealed that DBR1, DICER1, EXO1, FEN1, POP1, POP4, RPP30, and RPP38 were involved in 2 of the 8 pathways (pÂ <Â 0.05). By applying ICSNPathway analysis to BMD GWAS data, we identified seven candidate SNPs and eight pathways involving gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation, which may contribute to low BMD.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Youngseop Lee"", ids = ""1766894""); list(name = ""Sung Jae Choi"", ids = ""3848934""); list(name = ""Jong Dae Ji"", ids = ""31445622""); list(name = ""Gwan Gyu Song"", ids = ""5157481"")",33e8addc58dfaa53aa780e3411eb762f516c843a; e9a77b0f979f887076a4b6bbcf03e643f3ab4575; 6982d9f8ecbefa5aa0441ace06fc506077160b1d; e6a5f86daa19edcd76d73905bef65e5da5328ed5; 67c359d4c37ece9616ed53c9ef11577eeef19f98,8f86746e074a779f6168b621c79622c4f79f9287; 6480039b32988cf83bde873263b09897e14d551e; 6d623e92030a13dbd87ad6e99dc83b1e773f4320; 0352d364a5314a88c3a3a3d42406ea267b02406a; e1f6890da6fb8992328c14d3f0e8eddea2636f78; e6c84f16bfd976e63007bb0e080d7f50575b1686; 27d57f0c4e0d6bb9c39de107e12a9d4c977cec3c; 4decf9b11b26aeedf87ad0206f6d63a632e9002c; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; ec18289446c8d300d3ac1e8dbce8b81baf2ca00a; 90381d538e5751eaba07a8fa659cfa5fe21b92fd; a55bc18446e4209453c08a8d8ceb2f4a4a3a8977; 24536a523652ab0a983dbc0c4fd4437a12610c40; 5aa273d1db8662b5594ff2dcaeee279187f636b9; 56050e5efaeed53f15b2d9172a4433d4fc0b821a; 918795a565909dc7619842ed67314cbea37d380d; 4dd1a9685579259cbf2d7510c3f7941fae72ec5c; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 357e0fb622f9695f8a2d84dc5b9bf9c49a4b9531; 8eb45d1341afb1fd7916d281e8defb12c752f9c6; ae4cebb32bd34601c4ab8bcb4c659ab19a9df92d; 92d9f20dfc4ef188b2ea6babf65049964e2b3603; b69b80d21f00e55bfb86e6f8a39f62ba0512ec86,Molecular Biology Reports,39,8099-8106
be7b002f1292b321a7f9c1bb806d4d9b125058ee,Discovery of QTLs for water mining and water use efficiency traits in rice under water-limited condition through association mapping,"Developing trait introgressed rice cultivars is essential to sustain yield under aerobic conditions. Here, we report DNA markers governing variability in root traits, water use efficiency (WUE) and other biometric traits like total leaf area by association mapping. A set of 173 diverse rice germplasm accessions were phenotyped for root traits in specially designed root structures and WUE using carbon isotope discrimination (Î”13C) during the monsoon season (July to October) of two consecutive years (2007 and 2008). The panel was genotyped using 291 SSR markers spanning the entire genome of rice. Root biomass varied between 1.8 and 16.3Â gÂ plantâˆ’1 while root length between 22 and 78Â cm representing significant genetic variability. Similarly, Î”13C varied from 18 to 23Â â€°. The SSR markers showed extensive polymorphism with around 73Â % of all the markers revealing polymorphism information content values more than 0.5. Model-based structure analysis using the squared-allele frequency correlations revealed six subgroups among the panel with an average LD decay of about 10â€“20Â cM. The Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg analysis was carried out to compute the false discovery rate combined with the analysis of effective LD. A total of 82 markers were involved in 175 significant (corrected P values and Q values <0.05) markerâ€“trait associations (MTAs) across experiment 1 and experiment 2 and for the pooled data. Out of these, 22 markers were found to be associated with more than one trait. Common markers with significant associations were discovered for root biomass, total leaf area and total biomass suggesting the interdependency of these traits. Finally, 12 markers showed significant and stable MTAs across the experiments for different traits. An in silico analysis indicated that 45Â % of the MTAs overlapped with previously reported QTLs and can be used for QTL introgression through breeding.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Bheemanahalli R.

9a400a47b32c9ab6a11ea5d5f9063fb116500fcf,Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) Gene Variants and Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) Risk.,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process whereby epithelial cells assume mesenchymal characteristics to facilitate cancer metastasis. However, EMT also contributes to the initiation and development of primary tumors. Prior studies that explored the hypothesis that EMT gene variants contribute to epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) risk have been based on small sample sizes and none have sought replication in an independent population. We screened 15,816 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 296 genes in a discovery phase using data from a genome-wide association study of EOC among women of European ancestry (1,947 cases and 2,009 controls) and identified 793 variants in 278 EMT-related genes that were nominally (P < 0.05) associated with invasive EOC. These SNPs were then genotyped in a larger study of 14,525 invasive-cancer patients and 23,447 controls. A P-value <0.05 and a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.2 were considered statistically significant. In the larger dataset, GPC6/GPC5 rs17702471 was associated with the endometrioid subtype among Caucasians (odds ratio (OR) = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.07-1.25, P = 0.0003, FDR = 0.19), whereas F8 rs7053448 (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.27-2.24, P = 0.0003, FDR = 0.12), F8 rs7058826 (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.27-2.24, P = 0.0003, FDR = 0.12), and CAPN13 rs1983383 (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.69-0.90, P = 0.0005, FDR = 0.12) were associated with combined invasive EOC among Asians. In silico functional analyses revealed that GPC6/GPC5 rs17702471 coincided with DNA regulatory elements. These results suggest that EMT gene variants do not appear to play a significant role in the susceptibility to EOC.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ernest K Amankwah"", ids = ""4211842""); list(name = ""Hui-Yi Lin"", ids = ""150124587""); list(name = ""Jonathan P.

fffc2a0785a5f02ea337bfa2071dc6eea97d5c60,Metabolic correlates of prevalent mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome,"Introduction
Disruption of metabolic function is a recognized feature of late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). We sought to determine whether similar metabolic pathways are implicated in adults with Down syndrome (DS) who have increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD).


Methods
We examined peripheral blood from 292 participants with DS who completed baseline assessments in the Alzheimer's Biomarkers Consortium-Down Syndrome (ABC-DS) using untargeted mass spectrometry (MS). Our sample included 38 individuals who met consensus criteria for AD (DS-AD), 43 who met criteria for mild cognitive impairment (DS-MCI), and 211 who were cognitively unaffected and stable (CS).


Results
We measured relative abundance of 8,805 features using MS and 180 putative metabolites were differentially expressed (DE) among the groups at false discovery rate-corrected q< 0.05. From the DE features, a nine-feature classifier model classified the CS and DS-AD groups with receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) of 0.86 and a two-feature model classified the DS-MCI and DS-AD groups with ROC AUC of 0.88. Metabolite set enrichment analysis across the three groups suggested alterations in fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism.


Discussion
Our results reveal metabolic alterations in DS-AD that are similar to those seen in LOAD. The pattern of results in this cross-sectional DS cohort suggests a dynamic time course of metabolic dysregulation which evolves with clinical progression from non-demented, to MCI, to AD. Metabolomic markers may be useful for staging progression of DS-AD.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mark Mapstone"", ids = ""2547672""); list(name = ""Thomas J.

6700ec196206a044afa428e6b9a5fd7140311a2f,Bayesian decision theoretic approach to hypothesis problems with skewed alternatives,"Abstract Many hypothesis problems in practice require the selection of the left side or the right side alternative when the null is rejected. For parametric models, this problem can be stated as H 0 : Î¸ = Î¸ 0 vs. H âˆ’ : Î¸ Î¸ 0 or H + : Î¸ > Î¸ 0 . Frequentists use Type-III error (directional error) to develop statistical methodologies. This approach and other approaches considered in the literature do not take into account the situations where the selection of one side may be more important or when one side may be more probable than the other. This problem can be tackled by specifying a loss function and/or by specifying a hierarchical prior structure with allowing the skewness in the alternatives. Based on this, we develop a Bayesian decision theoretic methodology and show that the resulted Bayes rule perform better in the side of the alternatives which is more probable. The methodology can be also used in a frequentist's framework when it is desired to discover an alternative that is more important. We also consider the multiple hypotheses problem and develop new false discovery rates for the selection of the left and the right sides of alternatives. These discovery rates would be useful in the situations when one side of the alternatives are more important or more probable than the other.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Naveen K.

Diagnosis is based on clinical features and lymphocyte morphology (>55% circulating prolymphocytes), as no specific immunophenotypic or cytogenetic marker is available. According to WHO, cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with increased prolymphocytes (CLL/PL) (>10% and 4 different algorithms. Prediction analysis for microarray (PAM) and significance analysis of microarray data (SAM) were used to evaluate class performance, and to partition genes using a priori defined labels of morphology, immunophenotype and cytogenetics. Unsupervised analysis reproducibly partitioned samples into two homogeneous distinct groups, corresponding to the diagnoses of B-PLL and CLL. SAM analysis identified 3957 differentially expressed transcripts (false discovery rates 77% of which showed an over 2-fold difference in expression between the groups. PAM analysis refined a sub-group of 46 genes which most efficiently differentiated the two diseases. Differentially expressed genes included those encoding surface antigens, oncogenes, transcription factors, adhesion molecules or involved in cell cycle/cell proliferation, lipidic metabolism and catalytic protein activity. Comparison of CD5 positive (13) versus CD5 negative (7) cases and cases with (7) or without (13) del(p53) showed no reliable class prediction. Our study formally demonstrates that B-PLL and CLL are two distinct diseases, each showing a specific gene expression.

f3607ad9b8af13a60602f176049e47add29cdeea,A Diffusion MRI resource of 80 age-varied subjects with neuropsychological and demographic measures.,"Intended Audience: Researchers studying aging and cognition using diffusion MRI of the human brain or developing computational methods for such. Purpose: The primary purpose of this work is to provide a resource of high angular resolution diffusion MRI datasets of 80 normal volunteers aged 2564 together with neuropsychological testing data spanning general cognitive ability, memory, and information processing speed. To support the value of these data, we demonstrate statistical correlations between age and tract-based metrics calculated automatically from the data. The metrics are a function of fiber count, length, diffusion rate, and diffusion anisotropy; the statistical relationship to age was modeled with linear regression. Methods: Participants were 80 (39 male) healthy volunteers aged 25 to 64 years (mean=43.0, SD=10.5 years) who were enrolled in an IRB-approved protocol. MRI was conducted on a GE 1.5 T clinical scanner and included a T1-weighted volume (1x1x1.3mm, resolution 256x256x120) and dMRI protocol (2x2x2mm, 64-direction, b=1000s/mm, resolution 128x128x72). Each dMRI volume was corrected for subject motion and eddy current artifacts by affine registration to the first T2-weighted (b=0 s/mm) volume. All registrations were performed with FSL 5.0â€™s FLIRT with mutual information [1]. The orientations of the b-vectors were corrected by the rotation induced by these registrations, while brain extraction was performed using FSLâ€™s BET. Deterministic tractography was performed with custom software. Diffusion tensors were fit from the linearly interpolated dMRI volumes, and the principal eigenvector was used for tracking with one random seed per voxel, second-order Runge-Kutta integration, an angle threshold of 35, an FA threshold of 0.15, and a minimum length of 10 mm. The T1 volume was segmented into gray matter areas using Freesurfer 5.1.0 [2], and regions from the DesikanKilliany atlas were grouped into lobular structures. For each subject, fibers were mapped to the T1 space by rigid alignment with the FA volume. The fibers were similarly mapped to the JHU white matter atlas [3]. Following this, we performed segmentation using custom software. We performed connectivity-based segmentation with the lobular regions, including four lobe areas and the subcortex for each hemisphere (10 regions in total). For each pair of regions, a bundle was created from fibers with endpoints within one voxel of the regions. We found 30 pairs of regions with fibers present in all subjects. We also performed tract-based segmentation using the maximum probability threshold of each of 16 tracts in the JHU atlas. For each tract, bundles were created from fibers with at least 80% of their arc length contained by the mask. For both bundle types, fibers were culled by removing random fibers within a distance of 0.8 mm of an existing fiber. [4] For each fiber, the length and mean tensor indices (FA and MD) were computed by numerical integration along the curve. For each bundle, we determined the mean and summed tensor indices (as well as length-weighted versions), mean and summed fiber length, and fiber count (11 metrics in total). [5] Finally, we modeled the statistical relationship between each of the metrics and age, including sex as a covariate, using linear regression with the â€˜lmâ€™ function in R 2.15.1 [6]. We tested the hypothesis that each age regression coefficient was non-zero, and false discovery rate correction was used to control for multiple comparison within each bundle type. Results: For both bundle types, we found significant changes (p<0.05) with age after correction for multiple comparisons, as indicated in the tables below. Most decreases in white matter integrity were found in frontal fibers. Sum-based metrics were more numerous than mean-based metrics, and weighted metrics were slightly more numerous than non-weighted. FA and MD effects were present in roughly equal numbers. We found both increasing and decreasing trends in the metrics with age, as reported by the sign of the regression coefficient beta in the tables below. Discussion and Conclusions: Previous work has found age effects in frontal white matter [8,9] that are similar to our results; however, few studies have incorporated tractography statistics such as fiber length weighting and sum metrics, which we found to be sensitive to changes with age. As a resource, a significant value of this dataset is the opportunity to use it in studying both aging and methods for analysis of diffusion MRI data. We present only a tensor-based first step that supports the value of the data. There are many potential hypothesis-driven and exploratory analyses of the relationship between these images, aging, and neuropsychological data. This resource also provides an opportunity to develop, test, and compare dMRI analysis methods, including alternate diffusion models, tractography algorithms, and visualization methods. The dataset is available by request from our group website [10].

Background: Fusion genes, transcripts, and proteins are key drivers of hematopoietic oncogenesis and can serve as effective therapeutic targets. Among peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs), little is known about fusion genes except for those involving ALK. Discovery of fusion genes may provide therapeutic targets for PTCLs, which have poor outcomes with conventional therapy. We have developed methods for detecting candidate fusions using (1) mate-pair DNA sequencing (MPseq), an approach that spans the entire genome at a fraction of the cost of traditional whole-genome sequencing, and (2) RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Each technique has strengths, limitations, and false discovery rates. Here, we integrated results of both methods to discover and orthogonally validate expressed fusion genes in PTCLs.

Methods: DNA and RNA were extracted from 49 frozen, OCT-embedded clinical PTCL specimens, including 25 anaplastic large cell lymphomas; 16 PTCLs, not otherwise specified; and 8 other PTCLs. MPseq and RNAseq were performed using Illumina library protocols and a HiSeq 2000. Detection of fusion genes and transcripts followed our published methods (Blood 2012;120:2280 and Nucleic Acids Res 2011;39:e100, respectively). Functional annotation of genes involved in fusions was performed using DAVID.

Results: Of 2818 candidate chromosomal rearrangements identified by MPseq and 90 candidate fusion transcripts identified by RNAseq, 45 events were present in both datasets (mean/case, 0.9; range, 0-7). Fusions were inter-chromosomal in 16 and intra-chromosomal in 29. Annotation clusters with the highest enrichment scores related to SH2 domain-containing proteins and tyrosine kinases (including FER and MAP2K3). Seven genes were recurrently involved in fusions, including known fusion partners such as ALK and previously unreported fusion partners such as PPP1R8, a phosphatase inhibitor important for the activity of Polycomb group proteins such as EZH2. Detection of candidate events only by MPseq could be explained in part by breakpoints mapping to non-genic regions (79% of events). Detection only by RNAseq could be explained in part by unannotated transcripts spanning neighboring named genes (median intra-chromosomal distance, 0.09 MB vs. 12.7 MB for intra-chromosomal candidates identified by MPseq; p<0.0001, Wilcoxon test).

Conclusions: Integrated DNA/RNA sequencing is an effective, clinically feasible tool for simultaneous discovery and orthogonal validation of expressed fusion genes. This approach yielded fusions in PTCLs involving genes with key functions in lymphocytes, including novel and recurrent fusions, some of which might be targetable with compounds currently in clinical trial. Candidate intra-chromosomal fusion transcripts not identified by MPseq may represent unrecognized isoforms or the results of novel read-through mechanisms, and merit further study.

We aimed to understand the underlying molecular pathways influencing these differences by analyzing three publically-available, independently-generated microarray datasets of gene expression from endoscopic biopsies of the colon. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that all three datasets share 87 gene sets upregulated in UC lesions and 8 gene sets downregulated (false discovery rate <0.05). The upregulated pathways were dominated by gene sets involved in immune function and signaling, as well as the control of mitosis. We applied pathway analysis to genotype data derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of UC, consisting of 5,584 cases and 11,587 controls assembled from eight European-ancestry cohorts. The upregulated pathways derived from the gene expression data showed a highly significant overlap with pathways derived from the genotype data (33 of 56 gene sets, hypergeometric P = 1.49 Ã— 10(-19)). This study supports the hypothesis that heritable variation in gene expression as measured by GWAS signals can influence key pathways in the development of disease, and that comparison of genetic susceptibility loci with gene expression signatures can differentiate key drivers of inflammation from secondary effects on gene expression of the inflammatory process.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christopher Cardinale"", ids = ""7009137""); list(name = ""Zhi Wei"", ids = ""145312585""); list(name = ""Jin Li"", ids = ""49297724""); list(name = ""Junfei Zhu"", ids = ""4865226""); list(name = ""Mengnan Gu"", ids = ""38252793""); list(name = ""Robert N.

Results indicated that, for all respondents, carriers of the dopamine receptor D4 5-repeat allele were characterized by distinct depressive symptom trajectories across adolescence and early adulthood. Similarly, for males, individuals with the monoamine oxidase A 3.5-repeat allele exhibited unique depressive symptom trajectories. Specifically, the trajectories of those with the dopamine receptor D4 5-repeat allele were characterized by rising levels in the transition to adulthood, while their peers were experiencing a normative drop in depressive symptom frequency. Conversely, males with the monoamine oxidase A 3.5-repeat allele were shown to experience increased distress in late adolescence. An empirical method for examining a wide array of allelic combinations was employed, and false discovery rate methods were used to control the risk of false positives due to multiple testing. Special attention was given to thoroughly interrogate the robustness of the putative genetic effects.

bb49c4392e2f803e95e66d6cc90eb4a09dfc8a77,Identification of Development and Pathogenicity Related Gene in Botrytis cinerea via Digital Gene Expression Profile,"BACKGROUND
Botrytis cinerea, a haploid Euascomycete fungus that infects numerous crops, has been used as a model system for studying molecular phytopathology. Botrytis cinerea adopts various modes of infection, which are mediated by a number of pathogenicity and virulence-related genes. Many of these genes have not been reported previously.


OBJECTIVES
This study aimed to investigate development and pathogenicity-related genes between a novel nonpathogenic mutant and the Wild Type (WT) in B. cinerea.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Digital Gene Expression (DGE) tag profiling can reveal novel genes that may be involved in development and pathogenicity of plant pathogen. A large volume of B. cinerea tag-seq was generated to identify differential expressed genes by the Illumina DGE tag proï¬ling technology.


RESULTS
A total of 4,182,944 and 4,182,021 clean tags were obtained from the WT and a nonpathogenic mutant stain (BCt89), respectively, and 10,410 differentially expressed genes were identified. In addition, 84 genes were expressed in the WT only while 34 genes were expressed in the mutant only. A total of 664 differentially expressed genes were involved in 91 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathways, including signaling and metabolic pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
Expression levels of 1,426 genes were significantly up-regulated in the mutant compared to WT. Furthermore, 301 genes were down-regulated with False Discovery Rates (FDR) of < 0.001 and absolute value of log2 Ratio of â‰¥ 1.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bin Zhao"", ids = ""31451771""); list(name = ""He Long Si"", ids = ""26641509""); list(name = ""Zhi Ying Sun"", ids = ""11499498""); list(name = ""Zheng Xu"", ids = ""47047540""); list(name = ""Zhan Chen"", ids = ""46842382""); list(name = ""Jin lin Zhang"", ids = ""49050303""); list(name = ""Ji Hong Xing"", ids = ""46951446""); list(name = ""Jin Gao Dong"", ids = ""32141042"")",,c29c3049f0d7d069a9547f7c5fbf039b66bda5b1; e16218b8247cc4f13f3221677b3880621e08dcca; 1a3555826ef68df33933414fb8a0724ad715e97d; aabde8365320a6e3bf648b5dcaab62643faa82d7; 259f99ca5eeff33c2aa13c5dd56fa1a607faba32; 7f64737fdb6161e65756c2664685f12b1fd1b9c1; 2fc028ad37eaef4c80c39d2190c8e371dfc33f39; 23868db1a2a05eb87db6cb48bfbdc003733a5865; 3760da088a5c64d4f4ee1c3823e39c0237834d28; 825f410ba3c6c19bc419afe5f2a3243acc7af660; a764f7846aa8e04791e41ea2326a18d1e5a579d4; 05dafe14252e0f0f6cf3d35dce1d0d547a6880eb; 94f30226313b53ecb77d2a6be5f465de90fb92e7; 1038dd6cbc2ab2d9f285818ee7fb89eeeeb8909b; e4d96d5944b49d6b2dc54666734c6e36c041e7db; b7caf463e241566424fea185281dbea4993f88f1; c7874db8c8505786e6f199b8139248ad404953ae; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; 5fd2268bd5eb038a89eca2ac2c9b0c374749ff59; efe9750b41e26512c6c305e82d6648b770dd73ea; 3cd6adb3b7a156e3f70eb9f2dda050d3885c0970; 2639fc45d129eb967b8ebb8e742e1a7cc19351d2; 5670fea8ed2c546fa8081c8c13c504fe3932a588; 4d475a34f8a42e14aa0a3ee222c3112fee985564; 7107d41150d80e47451cf1d8084742b57a19295a; 45f28c3aa5c890bd854d8dc56b9403a06a6388ad; c26fbdcd521ee3ad6c75a2683621face485c606f; b1f0f28b849feadc76b03893c0acc0fcd379c6c3; 3f789180e386557477f5ff4961839d34f7168b2d; d6a8c83656911303912fc4fd513a0a196713398f; 35df862dfc83007939b5e4a9e63474da84317776; 5da60059c776b5f236da410ab7427aa96d2f4f80; aa45b263ac48c16547ccfe92bb051af517ed2388; f97c5c7bd33bcdb36600f456917839986c57b6a6; 26d2584058319f45e108e77c5d3ab903bf940a66; 3af82b997dec5c12485879b1f7fc21f032e76fe8; 4341668d3ba4ae93b7cc5d287ab3db057b572e08; 4adb08aceced03e62eed3db653d6281409fc7493,Jundishapur Journal of Microbiology,8,

This study was aimed to identify the genetic contributors to pulpal pain and inflammation. Inflamed pulps were collected from patients diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis (n=20). Normal pulps from teeth extracted for various reasons served as controls (n=20). Pain level was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). Genome-wide microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix GeneTitan Multichannel Instrument. The difference in gene expression levels were determined by the significance analysis of microarray program using a false discovery rate (q-value) of 5%. Genes involved in immune response, cytokineâ€“cytokine receptor interaction and signaling, integrin cell surface interactions, and others were expressed at relatively higher levels in the pulpitis group. Moreover, several genes known to modulate pain and inflammation showed differential expression in asymptomatic and mild pain patients (â©¾30â€‰mm on VAS) compared with those with moderate to severe pain. This exploratory study provides a molecular basis for the clinical diagnosis of pulpitis.

4cb26ca0fc668c8be83d7ab87c0472474a249a54,DIME: R-package for identifying differential ChIP-seq based on an ensemble of mixture models,"SUMMARY
Differential Identification using Mixtures Ensemble (DIME) is a package for identification of biologically significant differential binding sites between two conditions using ChIP-seq data. It considers a collection of finite mixture models combined with a false discovery rate (FDR) criterion to find statistically significant regions. This leads to a more reliable assessment of differential binding sites based on a statistical approach. In addition to ChIP-seq, DIME is also applicable to data from other high-throughput platforms.

5a35c30a72ba80d5be4184801dbb615b421cacad,Testing a single regression coefficient in high dimensional linear models.,"In linear regression models with high dimensional data, the classical z-test (or t-test) for testing the significance of each single regression coefficient is no longer applicable. This is mainly because the number of covariates exceeds the sample size. In this paper, we propose a simple and novel alternative by introducing the Correlated Predictors Screening (CPS) method to control for predictors that are highly correlated with the target covariate. Accordingly, the classical ordinary least squares approach can be employed to estimate the regression coefficient associated with the target covariate. In addition, we demonstrate that the resulting estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal even if the random errors are heteroscedastic. This enables us to apply the z-test to assess the significance of each covariate. Based on the p-value obtained from testing the significance of each covariate, we further conduct multiple hypothesis testing by controlling the false discovery rate at the nominal level. Then, we show that the multiple hypothesis testing achieves consistent model selection. Simulation studies and empirical examples are presented to illustrate the finite sample performance and the usefulness of the proposed method, respectively.",2016,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Lan"", ids = ""145837970""); list(name = ""Ping-Shou Zhong"", ids = ""1906488""); list(name = ""Runze Li"", ids = ""1812881""); list(name = ""Hansheng Wang"", ids = ""2213239""); list(name = ""Chih-Ling Tsai"", ids = ""2261249"")",866fdd033f75a825bd2d65a4075052a24653966e; fa7c6124e70dbd6017a43c045adee1763aa36aac; 8cd516949697c62d8b3a75e34432b2172477ef8e; f20e52da83cec973c551f68ad1a772c2424bb962; 0d54f5f642a346aa678491e4739055124c0dc44a; 59d635498682ba01281f3cfde4ed676a6148252d; 3b8bd3205317f3444255d0e189c149183d79e8c8; c0ad0edb3cc042e3061003ad8a62d59abb9274e8; 75e2a3d28907620d97d8619d0af13f76e512b3ce,3c335edf9b7d59eddb3c1cc0c0e5b7ad84d3c948; fe96483ba3f34ca4565e81a5cb130f66c02cf681; 10b6bf1f08cdf768030f27ab0c22bb768eda82cd; 7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263; 7cd1619370c1ab9b68acbb05d91b6562c78ed8a8; c3620866f75cf4d2cd498abc91b598ae1ddd1300; e57ecbbeecb9bce4610661542168f24bc45bab0b; afa65a3c7d08ba31ee00c576c3b36456ffaf735e; 2888f87e01c7adfd95f02c52339a7db8ad329677; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 6410ec306cfec30aa85d2172ac9eba1ef5bea4cc; bf67c1229b3d8dde001fee1388e3bbb2220af72f; 46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; 9529c25408dc86194d417aed73d49ae0e418f1be; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; ca1f3157fd5269224cca948f3b9f098e7c0bb473; e952633c79cf88bfcebdee83ab2fd81b7430a482; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 8dc764799971b9e1d63c5d37905f810ae01512bf; 13f4cf274509ae66ce71935828eb98ebdfdae66a; aed3e2b26aa6691b81be531e0e9e3c64854e137d; ef1bf316ce572888268aba556d8534768e8c816a; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 8bb843b4f274d77c60944e5ac7365a2f36d76c7d; b8db0ca28c530dd0d0671af5d1a1c238a5a03fee; 2c83124c091a7b1b40eab6a980178b0fa8913caf; 5f0d051ffcbde45f92daee6395883cd476777ad9; 5695999bf45467725111ec8174304ef434f4ce65; 4661a7d38647b36dc90957462a31a1c3d6af6dae; 2a4a3c9b6aac9733e11c8860a5be1f2d32a617bd; 865b1607a955f9fca1b46425a4c10e8fa79e3397; 33a3b064e3e0464f8e8d534abf70aefa54623e75; a593eb24ec9dd90a6107b8e696d2cf95752d573a; 79c7d6903e12e1b45bb3f8bc6ca862fed92b06ea; 757e8720086c31fc88ba514b19269111f608e398,Journal of econometrics,195 1,"

2273f1ce494e5bfd6ea0120abf390fd6c5932c91,Association study between inwardly rectifying potassium channels 2.1 and 4.1 and autism spectrum disorders,"&NA; Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders involving structural and functional impairment of the brain. Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels may contribute to the etiology of ASD by altering brain function. This study investigated the associations between genetic variants of KCNJ2 and KCNJ10 genes (encoding Kir2.1 and Kir4.1, respectively) and ASD risk in patients, and Kir channel expression in ASD model rats. This caseâ€control study involved a cohort of 269 Chinese children with ASD and 243 unrelated healthy controls. Twelve tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the KCNJ2 and KCNJ10 genes were genotyped by Sequenom Mass Array, while a valproic acid (VPA)â€induced rat model of ASD was used to evaluate Kir channel expression in the hippocampus. Among the 12 examined SNPs, only KCNJ10 rs1186689 was significantly associated with disease susceptibility; the variant T allele conferred a lower risk of developing ASD [odds ratio (OR) = 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.47â€“0.80, p false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.012, and OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.48â€“0.84, pFDR = 0.014 at the allelic and genotypic levels, respectively]. Additionally, hippocampal Kir2.1 and Kir4.1 levels were decreased in VPA as compared to control rats. These results demonstrated that KCNJ10 (rs1186689) polymorphisms was correlated with ASD susceptibility in Chinese Han children, and the abnormal expression of Kir2.1 and Kir4.1 in ASD model rats suggested a mechanism by which Kir channels may play a role in ASD.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Caihong Sun"", ids = ""34519234""); list(name = ""Mingyang Zou"", ids = ""8238048""); list(name = ""Ling Li"", ids = ""49192643""); list(name = ""Dexin Li"", ids = ""50988839""); list(name = ""Yongjuan Ma"", ids = ""31409027""); list(name = ""Wei Xia"", ids = ""144529351""); list(name = ""Lijie Wu"", ids = ""49279469""); list(name = ""Huan Ren"", ids = ""145899562"")",a22522245bef6ce13035e92dd262de83fb15228d; 00b31ca7c67af09ec1326661a6806df4c054cea7,6d0a2dfbe4b0ab19be971165409e26d58748a99a; 92c22987bdb4397ef53b8e2b0b8a7bda432a0900; a2c1827bf3dc30dda40757bb626400573f8fbc37; 8ef1b20f0db1654a72f5b5ba7eb07ff163751de2; 89e110705633703f9b879a303037f722ef566414; 7f5ca7c259fa0fcca8d0abd68ded087231cd1484; 8d480e47643dbecccfc59557d1e343719c7f0320; e06bb28771a54e0a6e20d72db90a4240e16279a4; d54e36fe1fbfc4bda24c03d8595bc4c4a0907814; 0c70f97ed57df4c56e17b46bd688d7bf63cf0c16; a8011e493c2b5282a38d7989bc6e30dbd4717004; d3eed7d9e4d01529bd3696903aaf772bc55fbab8; 85d3d17ecefb6ab70bcf5b18afbce83ff10aa7a3; e10330f9b56adeead2548dc0cd89a2f219fd0885; 288f8fb1644b0d5bf2af341cd7a1954a2096a4b7; 40a7c53c49a0d8d592f5b816c74bf2ae59f5575a; 1113ae39c72b0a72b91c7210cf8e764da92d0106; 6b70476537fc07c9db87730cdb4231f5431748d0; 5dbad1e4122ca4285bb0c4be046afe85db8da992; 54fa185a4c00bb7531648978f962b54159c37ce3; 525aacc7dc184e357400b77f5225f4afd1d7371e; 97e63e60d3ef450a38f427fc28a4e4dae5779bcb; 8d57083388cd75a4459c12333575c4ae0ed8c8e8; f6fb9f46f74206c6ae12a0b4e83e5b8b406680d0; 93f657c4ef36e7c8d8db901394cf2c8032d26027; 2ed7534a802b9119b3ffd45af803c5ee0a388f65; b05967981f1aadfd210ae4515a8d129a09346ab8; 3fcde371e23ba44eba151480f6e1225c28944386; a21d593badcf1431d12b6195d903b5677e1260fc; 596694d328b4f34bbac08c85ce80ddd474497308; 8187066da6a48c253cb5b93e737eef8385855f23; 58fdbd63af7601b2a26346f666b74ba2cb749a77,Life Sciences,213,183â€“189
372dd9f7f1128f25f08d48b735be1673ea564ae6,"TOP2A, GGH, and PECAM1 are associated with hematogenous, lymph node, and peritoneal recurrence in stage II/III gastric cancer patients enrolled in the ACTS-GC study","BACKGROUND
To identify factors related to relapse sites, we carried out an exploratory biomarker analysis of data from the Adjuvant Chemotherapy Trial of TS-1 for Gastric Cancer study, which is a randomized, controlled trial comparing postoperative adjuvant S-1 therapy with surgery alone in 1,059 patients with stage II/III gastric cancer.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Surgical specimens from 829 patients were retrospectively examined, and 63 genes involved in a variety of biological processes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Gene expression normalized to reference genes was categorized as lower or higher than the median, and association with relapse sites was analyzed based on 5-year relapse-free survival.


RESULTS
Hematogenous, lymph node, and peritoneal recurrence developed in 72, 105, and 138 of the 829 patients, respectively; hazard ratios were 0.79 (95% confidential interval: 0.54-1.16), 0.51 (0.31-0.82), and 0.60 (0.42-0.84), respectively. Expression of platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1) and topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) was strongly correlated with hematogenous recurrence and peritoneal recurrence, respectively (false discovery rate = 7.7Ã—10-5 and 0.002, respectively). Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) expression was moderately correlated with lymph node recurrence (false discovery rate = 0.34). Relapse-free survival was worse in patients expressing high levels of PECAM1 (hazard ratio = 2.37, 1.65-3.41), TOP2A (hazard ratio = 2.35, 1.55-3.57), or GGH (hazard ratio = 1.87, 1.13-3.08), respectively.

7d97244ef8750a1c9231afca7c3ba1ee7dec7692,NCOA2 is a candidate target gene of 8q gain associated with clinically aggressive prostate cancer.,"Prostate carcinomas harboring 8q gains are associated with poor clinical outcome, but the target genes of this genomic alteration remain to be unveiled. In this study, we aimed to identify potential 8q target genes associated with clinically aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genome-wide mRNA expression, and protein expression analyses. Using FISH, we first characterized the relative copy number of 8q (assessed with MYC flanking probes) of a series of 50 radical prostatectomy specimens, with available global gene expression data and typed for E26 transformation specific (ETS) rearrangements, and then compared the gene expression profile of PCa subsets with and without 8q24 gain using Significance Analysis of Microarrays. In the subset of tumors with ERG fusion genes (ERG+), five genes were identified as significantly overexpressed (false discovery rate [FDR], â‰¤ 5%) in tumors with relative 8q24 gain, namely VN1R1, ZNF417, CDON, IKZF2, and NCOA2. Of these, only NCOA2 is located in 8q (8q13.3), showing a statistically higher mRNA expression in the subgroup with relative 8q gain, both in the ERG+ subgroup and in the whole series (P = 0.000152 and P = 0.008, respectively). Combining all the cases with NCOA2 overexpression, either at the mRNA or at the protein level, we identified a group of tumors with NCOA2 copy-number increase, independently of ETS status and relative 8q24 gain. Furthermore, for the first time, we detected a structural rearrangement involving NCOA2 in PCa. These findings warrant further studies with larger series to evaluate if NCOA2 relative copy-number gain presents prognostic value independently of the well-established poor prognosis associated with MYC relative copy-number gain.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Maria P.

4d65e9ceb2981fc081f42544b5110ccd07d28976,On parametric empirical Bayes methods for comparing multiple groups using replicated gene expression profiles.,"DNA microarrays provide for unprecedented large-scale views of gene expression and, as a result, have emerged as a fundamental measurement tool in the study of diverse biological systems. Statistical questions abound, but many traditional data analytic approaches do not apply, in large part because thousands of individual genes are measured with relatively little replication. Empirical Bayes methods provide a natural approach to microarray data analysis because they can significantly reduce the dimensionality of an inference problem while compensating for relatively few replicates by using information across the array. We propose a general empirical Bayes modelling approach which allows for replicate expression profiles in multiple conditions. The hierarchical mixture model accounts for differences among genes in their average expression levels, differential expression for a given gene among cell types, and measurement fluctuations. Two distinct parameterizations are considered: a model based on Gamma distributed measurements and one based on log-normally distributed measurements. False discovery rate and related operating characteristics of the methodology are assessed in a simulation study. We also show how the posterior odds of differential expression in one version of the model is related to the ratio of the arithmetic mean to the geometric mean of the two sample means. The methodology is used in a study of mammary cancer in the rat, where four distinct patterns of expression are possible.",2003,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christina Kendziorski"", ids = ""2440790""); list(name = ""Michael A.

356e6c7eacca6caa94a5a96f41a9c785064f5693,Fast Detection of Overlapping Communities via Online Tensor Methods on GPUs,"We present a fast tensor-based approach for detecting hidden overlapping communities under the Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodel (MMSB). We present two implementations, \viz a GPU-based implementation which exploits the parallelism of SIMD architectures and a CPU-based implementation for larger datasets, wherein the GPU memory does not suffice. Our GPU-based implementation involves a careful optimization of storage, data transfer and matrix computations. Our CPU-based implementation involves sparse linear algebraic operations which exploit the data sparsity. We use stochastic gradient descent for multilinear spectral optimization and this allows for flexibility in the tradeoff between node sub-sampling and accuracy of the results. We validate our results on datasets from Facebook, Yelp and DBLP where ground truth is available, using notions of $p$-values and false discovery rates, and obtain high accuracy for membership recovery. We compare our results, both in terms of execution time and accuracy, to the state-of-the-art algorithms such as the variational method, and report many orders of magnitude gain in the execution time.

3918fcbc62e07eb7cb2efa9b88e4c4a8bdefd51e,"Altered gene expression profiles in the brain, kidney, and lung of one-month-old cloned pigs.","Although numerous mammalian species have been successfully cloned by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), little is known about gene expression of cloned pigs by SCNT. In the present study, expression profiles of 1-month-old cloned pigs generated from fetal fibroblasts (n = 5) were compared to those of age-matched controls (n = 5) using a 13K oligonucleotide microarray. The brain, kidney, and lung were chosen for microarray analysis to represent tissues from endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm in origin. In clones, 179 and 154 genes were differentially expressed in the kidney and the lung, respectively (fold change >2, p < 0.05, false discovery rate = 0.05), whereas only seven genes were differentially expressed in the brain of clones. Functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that they were enriched in diabetic nephropathy in the kidney, delayed alveologenesis as well as downregulated MAPK signaling pathways in the lung, which was accompanied with collapsed alveoli in the histological examination of the lung. To evaluate whether the gene expression anomalies are associated with changes in DNA methylation, global concentration of the methylated cytosine was measured in lung DNA by HPLC. Clones were significantly hypermethylated (5.72%) compared to the controls (4.13%). Bisulfite-pyrosequencing analyses of the promoter regions of differentially expressed genes, MYC and Period 1 (PER1), however, did not show any differences in the degree of DNA methylation between controls and clones. Together, these findings demonstrate that cloned pigs have altered gene expression that may potentially cause organ dysfunction.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Joonghoon Park"", ids = ""6680014""); list(name = ""Liangxue Lai"", ids = ""38165908""); list(name = ""Melissa S.

7fb04fc0b34034f8974b23fef07c0f63e188f319,Zero-inflated Poisson model based likelihood ratio test for drug safety signal detection,"In recent decades, numerous methods have been developed for data mining of large drug safety databases, such as Food and Drug Administrationâ€™s (FDAâ€™s) Adverse Event Reporting System, where data matrices are formed by drugs such as columns and adverse events as rows. Often, a large number of cells in these data matrices have zero cell counts and some of them are â€œtrue zerosâ€ indicating that the drug-adverse event pairs cannot occur, and these zero counts are distinguished from the other zero counts that are modeled zero counts and simply indicate that the drug-adverse event pairs have not occurred yet or have not been reported yet. In this paper, a zero-inflated Poisson model based likelihood ratio test method is proposed to identify drug-adverse event pairs that have disproportionately high reporting rates, which are also called signals. The maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters of zero-inflated Poisson model based likelihood ratio test are obtained using the expectation and maximization algorithm. The zero-inflated Poisson model based likelihood ratio test is also modified to handle the stratified analyses for binary and categorical covariates (e.g. gender and age) in the data. The proposed zero-inflated Poisson model based likelihood ratio test method is shown to asymptotically control the type I error and false discovery rate, and its finite sample performance for signal detection is evaluated through a simulation study. The simulation results show that the zero-inflated Poisson model based likelihood ratio test method performs similar to Poisson model based likelihood ratio test method when the estimated percentage of true zeros in the database is small. Both the zero-inflated Poisson model based likelihood ratio test and likelihood ratio test methods are applied to six selected drugs, from the 2006 to 2011 Adverse Event Reporting System database, with varying percentages of observed zero-count cells.",2017,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lan Huang"", ids = ""145899449""); list(name = ""Dan Zheng"", ids = ""144555548""); list(name = ""Jyoti N.

For example, in the motivating study the goal is to identify species of bacteria near the roots of wheat plants (rhizobacteria) that are moderately or strongly associated with productivity. However, standard procedures discover the most abundant species even when their association is weak and fail to discover many moderate and strong associations when the species are not abundant. This article provides a new FDR-controlling method based on a finite mixture of multinomial distributions and shows that it tends to discover more moderate and strong associations and fewer weak associations when the data are heterogeneous across tests. The new method is applied to the rhizobacteria data and performs favorably over competing methods.",2017,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Joshua Habiger"", ids = ""50076269""); list(name = ""David Watts"", ids = ""80754603""); list(name = ""Michael Anderson"", ids = ""144679993"")",ed1a47384330fa8f306b849a35bfd5e21c7c9ad8; 7d985f36551b17315aeea02163adc2dabf352a83; 5f979b16d652f594af251c830cb0436aa5814a22; be3681e06bb3b0635b9a3775935dd15c0151c823,6039902a5af611c607ce7167a8757bb3c6c00904; 01177368c3b433ce2df4752c4905df3ac13313ab; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 48dfa03f2bc315534c3d08b7bf9c4cc93fc39450; 347df1f3b59c35985e776924cbc8d6e45ec19d62; 01573b8b098c9ed36cb54966a4a760c8df254be5; 6460a45dfe077e0382ea11508d1235c7b6baabc5; 358775fbe718d690337a538f0221800a3b17b636; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; e9cddd8d7c37989539e6c6bad14db3d488441ea5; 297729649e7cc13fb54880ac4cf49ef89dfd72a7; db8aa12f652ed70d33742c144d0b2bb681bee35b; fa0eafdfe63278c7e2eced41df293de15a50c194; 288b9861e781eb8e7567b1f7d23487dd6bd5edb9; bdfb57141b2141095ed942b28be24808aeba8d54; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; af2a8675a1c160c17d66a0fb2a22a210d6d7eabe; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 4c52c7a0510e217966a72c019a47116aab1cf282; e1dd7aab4aaa38940fd26f357e78f90099c8c112,Biometrics,73 2,"

bb94c66a4493f98c812c813c2ce12c08c15ef10e,Serum proteomic analysis of diet-induced steatohepatitis and metabolic syndrome in the Ossabaw miniature swine.,"We recently developed a nutritional model of steatohepatitis and metabolic syndrome in Ossabaw pigs. Here we describe changes in the serum proteome of pigs fed standard chow (control group; n = 7), atherogenic diet (n = 5), or modified atherogenic diet (M-ath diet group; n = 6). Pigs fed atherogenic diet developed metabolic syndrome and mildly abnormal liver histology, whereas pigs fed M-ath diet exhibited severe metabolic syndrome and liver injury closely resembling human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Using a label-free mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach, we identified 1,096 serum proteins, 162 of which changed significantly between any two diet groups (false discovery rate <5%). Biological classification of proteins with significant changes revealed functions previously implicated in development of NASH in humans, including immune system regulation and inflammation (orosomucoid 1, serum amyloid P component, paraoxonase 1, protein similar to alpha-2-macroglobulin precursor, beta-2-microglobulin, p101 protein, and complement components 2 and C8G), lipid metabolism (apolipoproteins C-III, E, E precursor, B, and N), structural and extracellular matrix proteins (transthyretin and endopeptidase 24.16 type M2), and coagulation [carboxypeptidase B2 (plasma)].

814b710d6b25a59a8684419c7bba02706582eef2,FDR control of detected regions by multiscale matched filtering,"ABSTRACT Feature extraction from observed noisy samples is a common important problem in statistics and engineering. This paper presents a novel general statistical approach to the region detection problem in long data sequences. The proposed technique is a multiscale kernel regression in conjunction with statistical multiple testing for region detection while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) and maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio via matched filtering. This is achieved by considering a one-dimensional region detection problem as its equivalent zero-dimensional peak detection problem. The detection method does not require a priori knowledge of the shape of the nonzero regions. However, if the shape of the nonzero regions is known a priori, e.g., rectangular pulse, the signal regions can also be reconstructed from the detected peaks, seen as their topological point representatives. Simulations show that the method can effectively perform signal detection and reconstruction in the simulated data under high noise conditions, while controlling the FDR of detected regions and their reconstructed length.",2017,Medicine; Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Nezamoddin N.

9dbb0d0fbceb3174aef95cd87d55270f5dd01444,"A Bottom-up Approach to Testing Hypotheses That Have a Branching Tree Dependence Structure, with False Discovery Rate Control","Modern statistical analyses often involve testing large numbers of hypotheses. In many situations, these hypotheses may have an underlying tree structure that not only helps determine the order that tests should be conducted but also imposes a dependency between tests that must be accounted for. Our motivating example comes from testing the association between a trait of interest and groups of microbes that have been organized into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Given p-values from association tests for each individual OTU or ASV, we would like to know if we can declare that a certain species, genus, or higher taxonomic grouping can be considered to be associated with the trait. For this problem, a bottom-up testing algorithm that starts at the lowest level of the tree (OTUs or ASVs) and proceeds upward through successively higher taxonomic groupings (species, genus, family etc.) is required. We develop such a bottom-up testing algorithm that controls the error rate of decisions made at higher levels in the tree, conditional on findings at lower levels in the tree. We further show this algorithm controls the false discovery rate based on the global null hypothesis that no taxa are associated with the trait. By simulation, we also show that our approach is better at finding driver taxa, the highest level taxa below which there are dense association signals. We illustrate our approach using data from a study of the microbiome among patients with ulcerative colitis and healthy controls.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yunxiao Li"", ids = ""47001575""); list(name = ""Yi-Juan Hu"", ids = ""7741363""); list(name = ""Glen A.

Transcriptional Regulatory Patterns in Yeast Revealed through Expression Quantitative Trait Locus Mapping. (Under the direction of Dr. Zhao-Bang Zeng.) Expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) mapping combines large scale mRNA expression analysis and classical quantitative genetics methods to find the correlated variation between genome and transcriptome. We applied a sequential genome scan method to build genetic architectures for expression traits in a published yeast eQTL mapping data set. We compared mapping results from several variants of the method. We used the threshold controlling the genome-wise type I error rate to declare eQTLs, and used False Discovery Rate (FDR) to assess the overall error rate in the whole mapping study. In this mapping population, expression traits tend to be mapped onto its own sequence and avoid being mapped onto their transcriptional factors. Sequence variations around transcriptional factors are not preferentially associated with transcript abundance variation of their regulatory target genes, though the expression traits of transcriptional factors and their targets tend to have overlapping eQTL regions. Indirect trans-regulation mechanisms play a significant role in order to connect trans-acting eQTLs with certain biological pathways. We have developed a graphical tool to visualize the myriad relationships suggested by eQTL analysis. The tool allows dynamical superimposition of biological annotation onto declared eQTLs to find the matching cases between statistical patterns inferred from this mapping population and results of biological investigation on this organism. Finally, we proposed a probabilistic way of combining statistical patterns with biological annotations based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem. The resulting posterior probability that a gene in an eQTL causes the trait variation can be used to prioritize genes in an eQTL.

455409f8dc7917156c853fe99bbcb28a0174ddb4,Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in irritable bowel syndrome.,"BACKGROUND
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a stress-sensitive disorder. Environmental factors including stress can trigger epigenetic changes, which have not been well-studied in IBS. We performed a pilot study investigating genome-wide DNA methylation of IBS patients and healthy controls (HCs) to identify potential epigenetic markers and associated pathways. Additionally, we investigated relationships of epigenetic changes in selected genes with clinical traits.


METHODS
Twenty-seven IBS patients (59% women; 10 IBS-diarrhea, 8 IBS-constipation, 9 IBS-mixed) and 23 age- and sex-matched HCs were examined. DNA methylation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was measured using HM450 BeadChip, and representative methylation differences were confirmed by bisulphite sequencing. Gene expression was measured using quantitative PCR. Gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI symptoms were measured using validated questionnaires. Associations were tested using non-parametric methods.


KEY RESULTS
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of IBS patients compared with HCs identified 133 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) (mean difference â‰¥10%; p < 0.05). These genes were associated with gene ontology terms including glutathione metabolism related to oxidative stress and neuropeptide hormone activity. Validation by sequencing confirmed differential methylation of subcommissural organ (SCO)-Spondin (SSPO), glutathione-S-transferases mu 5 (GSTM5), and tubulin polymerization promoting protein genes. Methylation of two promoter CpGs in GSTM5 was associated with epigenetic silencing. Epigenetic changes in SSPO gene were positively correlated with hospital anxiety and depression scores in IBS patients (r > 0.4 and false discovery rate <0.05).


CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES

47c584ad94c704a4ac1000b503361ad4a97eff0b,Label-free proteomics uncovers energy metabolism and focal adhesion regulations responsive for endometrium receptivity.,"The menstrual cycle of the female uterus leads to periodic changes of the endometrium. These changes are important for developing the endometrial receptivity and for achieving competency of embryo implantation. However, the molecular events underlying the endometrial receptivity process remain poorly understood. Here we applied an LC-MS-based label-free quantitative proteomic approach to compare the endometrial tissues in the midsecretory (receptive) phase with the endometrial tissues in the proliferative phase from age-matched woman (n = 6/group). The proteomes of endometrial tissues were extracted using an SDS-based detergent, digested by the filter-aided sample preparation procedures, and subsequently analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS (Orbitrap XL) with a 4 h gradient. Reliable protein expression profiles were reproducibly obtained from the endometrial tissues in the receptive and proliferative phases. A total of 2138 protein groups were quantified under highly stringent criteria with a false discovery rate of <1% for peptide and protein groups. Among these proteins, 317 proteins had differences in expression that were statistically significant between the receptive and proliferative phases. Direct protein-protein interaction network analyses of these significantly changed proteins showed that the up-regulation of creatine kinase B-type (CKB) in the receptive phase may be related to endometrium receptivity. The interaction network also showed that proteins related to cell-cell adhesion were down-regulated. Moreover, the results from KEGG pathway analyses are consistent with the protein-protein interaction results. The proteins, including alpha-actinin (ACTN), extracellular matrix proteins, integrin alpha-V, and so on, that are involved in the focal adhesion pathway were down-regulated in the receptive phase compared with the proliferative phase, which may facilitate the implantation of the fertilized ovum. Selected proteins were validated by Western blot analysis and indirect immunofluorescence, including the up-regulation of CKB and down-regulation ACTN in the receptive phase. In summary, our proteomic analysis study shows potential for predicting the endometrial remodeling from the proliferative to the receptivity phase in women, and these results also reveal the key biological mechanisms (such as energy metabolism and focal adhesion) underlying human endometrial receptivity.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Q Chen"", ids = ""48772454""); list(name = ""Aijun Zhang"", ids = ""2463807""); list(name = ""Feng Yu"", ids = ""144591906""); list(name = ""Jing Gao"", ids = ""49952124""); list(name = ""Yue Liu"", ids = ""1694101""); list(name = ""Chengli Yu"", ids = ""7530594""); list(name = ""Hu Zhou"", ids = ""14936084""); list(name = ""Chen Ying Xu"", ids = ""145859362"")",553e8bdacaa3256bf73f53e0dbd3fcba3887894f; 462bc53d2a07f3493d531b8a9fe2c961b9572f2c; f08b837b36e002be04a41a46648b521f75e21dd1; a8f39e9f3ca665b28bb994f6a109d424ab142bf1; cbf2e916475d027c449626491d8f48dcb62f881f; 948b0943e6a6fd4a2c899c0f962eef7cf7b8ce2f; 7e0a524995847d7b0e40db89ade47e199d7013be; 9ced96711ee26a8e1bb816405aab1b914a494f43; 320e104f8f4a963d2b91e713c9437a2fa4576051; f544e25fe0e6a86fdadab587189a53b73598e5cd; 73ed04068c784cade20516fc3ba02af1fdabf813; 61af4e838da75f779f007c8e20336790593373ef,,Journal of proteome research,14 4,"

Our method is based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM), trained using Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and on blob detection. The SVM detects potential new blocks between a set of images; the blob detection, then, confirms the identification of a block inside the area indicated by the SVM and derives the shape of the block. The results from the automatic analysis were compared with block statistics from visual inspection. We tested our method in 6 areas consisting of 1000x1000 pixels, where several hundreds of blocks were identified. The results for the given test areas produced a true positive rate of ~75% for blocks with sizes larger than 0.7 m (i.e., approx. 3 times the available ground pixel size) and a false discovery rate of ~8.5%. Using blob detection we also recover the size of each block within 3 pixels of their actual size.",2018,Physics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""L. Fanara"", ids = ""52285866""); list(name = ""K.

047f43f3807f909d5788c7e33aefa732e0fffa7d,ConReg-R: Extrapolative recalibration of the empirical distribution of p-values to improve false discovery rate estimates,"BackgroundFalse discovery rate (FDR) control is commonly accepted as the most appropriate error control in multiple hypothesis testing problems. The accuracy of FDR estimation depends on the accuracy of the estimation of p-values from each test and validity of the underlying assumptions of the distribution. However, in many practical testing problems such as in genomics, the p-values could be under-estimated or over-estimated for many known or unknown reasons. Consequently, FDR estimation would then be influenced and lose its veracity.ResultsWe propose a new extrapolative method called Constrained Regression Recalibration (ConReg-R) to recalibrate the empirical p-values by modeling their distribution to improve the FDR estimates. Our ConReg-R method is based on the observation that accurately estimated p-values from true null hypotheses follow uniform distribution and the observed distribution of p-values is indeed a mixture of distributions of p-values from true null hypotheses and true alternative hypotheses. Hence, ConReg-R recalibrates the observed p-values so that they exhibit the properties of an ideal empirical p-value distribution. The proportion of true null hypotheses (Ï€0) and FDR are estimated after the recalibration.ConclusionsConReg-R provides an efficient way to improve the FDR estimates. It only requires the p-values from the tests and avoids permutation of the original test data. We demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves FDR estimation on several gene expression datasets obtained from microarray and RNA-seq experiments.ReviewersThe manuscript was reviewed by Prof. Vladimir Kuznetsov, Prof. Philippe Broet, and Prof. Hongfang Liu (nominated by Prof. Yuriy Gusev).",2010,Medicine; Biology; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Juntao Li"", ids = ""49298162""); list(name = ""Puteri Paramita"", ids = ""145374625""); list(name = ""Kwok Pui Choi"", ids = ""1740671""); list(name = ""R Krishna Murthy Karuturi"", ids = ""5507963"")",bc3bfccb15e03561ff48454d49079b77b3681348; 047f43f3807f909d5788c7e33aefa732e0fffa7d; f239d17ffdc7feecf3264cecee90333a98594e3e; 90384be86ae81e63d9d6402ea4537cf48d83f405; bf29baef51e3d4b83645b0efc9637eb2938b730a; bae2fd4fac77257e8ada163ea9d17ea4da12e2a7; dec42d8b5603299bbeba1c25ae17f1ba2fcc13ad; d8acfc38795a82cf0fdada511db89e6a0dfbec7c,f91f997a356bd6207c3b55c9ffdaf77c4e25afbb; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 7ec68a870bd61810ee957b7ffaa3740da86ae9c7; 1a3555826ef68df33933414fb8a0724ad715e97d; 67db62c833ca56f802c19b97e0a1fd72eb127c45; 047f43f3807f909d5788c7e33aefa732e0fffa7d; ff059a3afdb1a365a0021a1322243b839e62d548; 427eaafcd47b3abc620b953ff021f25925ff0e62; 76a600e3e067294b5694a7c7ed895bc6cef83699; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; af2b7af47ff23290f75a48ba2fd1ad1a9aca1dde; 92ed589fccd5986e30f7074437bb2d7623c5e4c8; dd51fff2d89136099c52d0b306ef08d6d481a414; d1984defd4ccd17ff944219ebd34420e3fb78239; 890948490892f4fbac75095f093d7db6b1d2f08c; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc; 1c7ffc9b8da5873f06a3edc4448f80a01f174aeb; d5751a66f9cfe0b63a351e12af84f064adaccacd; e2a187c6ec22b531a438bfa65b679b9a1a87597d; c5d8dd126d8a22f1a8b24c23dc04d75e6caebd71; 23cda2bc52fe04a64d911ad7caf3bf9249bedc30,Biology Direct,6,27 - 27

eb28f67e71595042f364b99fd06504a3d4c4f823,A Bayesian False Discovery Rate for Multiple Testing,"Abstract Case-control studies of genetic polymorphisms and gene-environment interactions are reporting large numbers of statistically significant associations, many of which are likely to be spurious. This problem reflects the low prior probability that any one null hypothesis is false, and the large number of test results reported for a given study. In a Bayesian approach to the low prior probabilities, Wacholder et al. (2004) suggest supplementing the p-value for a hypothesis with its posterior probability given the study data. In a frequentist approach to the test multiplicity problem, Benjamini & Hochberg (1995) propose a hypothesis-rejection rule that provides greater statistical power by controlling the false discovery rate rather than the family-wise error rate controlled by the Bonferroni correction. This paper defines a Bayes false discovery rate and proposes a Bayes-based rejection rule for controlling it. The method, which combines the Bayesian approach of Wacholder et al. with the frequentist approach of Benjamini & Hochberg, is used to evaluate the associations reported in a case-control study of breast cancer risk and genetic polymorphisms of genes involved in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks.",2007,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Alice S.

Long intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been implicated in diverse biological processes including p53 signaling and chromatin remodeling, but have not been thoroughly profiled in human cancers. Here, we have developed an approach for ab initio reconstruction of poly-A+ transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data for the unbiased discovery of novel transcripts. To accomplish this, we developed AssemblyLine, a method that clusters and filters large collections of transcripts to produce a consensus transcriptome. To demonstrate AssemblyLine, we sequenced a cohort comprised of 81 prostatic tissues (20 benign, 47 localized tumors, and 14 metastases) and 21 prostatic cell lines using the Illumina Genome Analyzer II and generated 1.723 billion sequence fragments. We successfully aligned 1.42 billion reads with Tophat â€“ a program capable of ab initio splice junction discovery â€“ and then used Cufflinks to model sample-specific transcriptomes totaling 8.25 million transcripts. AssemblyLine condensed the 8.25 million original transcripts into 35,415 distinct transcriptional loci, of which 1,859 (5.2%) represented candidate lincRNAs that lacked genomic overlap with known gene annotations. These putative RNAs lacked robust open reading frames suggesting that the vast majority were non-coding. Further, they exhibited evolutionary conservation and were enriched with histone modifications supporting independent transcriptional start sites and active transcription. Together, these results add confidence to AssemblyLine's nomination process and suggest that these novel lincRNAs may be transcriptionally active in prostate cancer. We then selected 106 transcripts that were differentially expressed in localized prostate cancer when compared to benign adjacent tissue (False Discovery Rate < 0.05), and 15 transcripts with profound cancer outlier expression profiles for further study. These 121 Prostate Cancer Associated Transcripts (PCATs) accurately classified benign, localized, and metastatic prostate cancer tissues by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Consistent with AssemblyLine's nominations, PCR-based experiments on selected transcripts in an independent tissue cohort showed high validation rates for the transcript structure and expression level predictions. Furthermore, in vitro studies of PCAT-1, a novel lincRNA observed in our dataset as highly upregulated in prostate cancer, revealed direct regulation by the histone methyltransferase EZH2. siRNA knockdown of PCAT-1 in LNCaP, a prostate cancer cell line, caused a 25-50% decrease in cell proliferation. Thus, this study establishes a paradigm for ab initio transcriptome annotation and discovery of novel lincRNAs in cancer tissues. Further, these results provide intriguing evidence that lincRNAs are aberrantly expressed and may play a role in prostate cancer progression.

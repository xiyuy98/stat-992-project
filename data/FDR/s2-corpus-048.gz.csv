27bec69c2a7dfac123b797cf74ffd8416d77a183,The Influence of Weather on the Incidence of Primary Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage.,"BACKGROUND
Intracerebral hemorrhage has been associated with changes in various weather conditions. The primary aim of this study was to examine the collective influence of temperature, barometric pressure, and dew point temperature on the incidence of primary spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH).


METHODS
Between January 2013 and December 2016, patients with sICH due to hypertension or amyloid angiopathy with a known time of onset were identified prospectively. Meteorological variables 6 hours prior to time of onset were obtained from the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration via two weather stations. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation, random populations of meteorological conditions in a 6-hour time window during the same years were generated. The actual meteorological conditions 6-hours prior to sICH were compared to those from the randomly generated populations. The false discovery rate method was used to identify significant meteorological variables.


RESULTS
Time of onset was identified in 455 of 603 (75.5%) patients. Distribution curves for change in temperature, mean barometric pressure, and change in barometric pressure 6-hours prior to hemorrhage ictus were found to be significantly different from the random populations. (FDR approach P < .05). For a given change in temperature associated with intracerebral hemorrhage, mean barometric pressure was higher (1018 millibar (mb) versus 1016 mb, Pâ€¯=â€¯.03). Barometric pressure data was not influenced by variations in temperature.


CONCLUSIONS
We concluded that barometric pressure primarily influences the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. The association described in the literature between temperature and intracerebral hemorrhage is likely confounded by variations in barometric pressure.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rajeev K.

Methods used today are costly, time consuming and exhaust the limited number of cells needed for transplantation. The aim of this study was to analyze if surplus plasma from CB contains biomarkers that can predict HSPC content in CB. Frozen, surplus plasma from 95 CB units was divided into two groups based on CD34+ cell concentration. Birth weight, gestation age, gender, mode of delivery, collection volume, nucleated cell count and colony forming unit assay results were available. Samples were analyzed with a proximity ligation assay covering 92 different proteins. Two-group t-test with p-values adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR) identified 5 proteins that significantly differed between the two groups. CDCP1 was the most significant (FDR adjusted p-value 0.006). Correlation with CDCP1 concentration was most significant for CD34+ concentration and nucleated cell count. Multivariate analysis showed that CD34 and gender seemed to influence the level of CDCP1. In conclusion, CDCP1 was identified as a potential biomarker of HSPC content in CB. The finding also warrants further investigation for a possible role of CDCP1 in regulating HSPC presence in CB.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sofia FrÃ¤ndberg"", ids = ""8298989""); list(name = ""Julia Asp"", ids = ""7140089""); list(name = ""Berit Waldner"", ids = ""39164097""); list(name = ""Jan Holgersson"", ids = ""4416831""); list(name = ""Lars Palmqvist"", ids = ""2242583"")",,62c9e579b2bfb623c3db5e75322a314bb4170262; cdd54bae85045346205b49d21bc1fe4c1ac4ff75; e358a53e30868b66f99c2a9b5201e93733239f09; 021f6ac1a4dbb4b3db47d4ca940067b813781edd; e3aa0b90e470a4373a1a6d52f7c95239ea352bc8; 3633529b2411aec315dbf1b704fe46f6c0bff20e; 5e26c8346e6b9a93c866d009fa94bf4133d9b50c; 61582ef6b802865d6fff0ce1da4b5705d46d9ab6; a430ffca29b2cbf96d281319ae2a6e32ab152b83; 2a345d0c4692ee2d5d02dfbb420f822fa9f04602; db044a4cfd707b0f5af959264de5fa9bf13a04d6; 5e414676539cf51d70184e766416390b6292d62f; 71c687687ab41c8b0acae9dec1457f497858e563; 0d2016f2f318e5dbe378555636fd14c8d39df66d; 86c14bbbd995c4dbc97dfe269f8e54b6a911c5b0; a74a713a32e1eb2ee534ec624ea96eb210064e17; d902e896019a96efc05ae57f2cce12aeb160559f; 1a5b3fe3d9755270776e512da513f93fe372710a; bba88ee7ee9766d0161f0d4c90956f063264416d; 28c256688ab0b7ffe69d71004dfb6313d807bb37; 1b64be259abd893cf694613edd298696b67734bd; 25e016da6f8bdbc9cd1b9f148737e33d39d1b0ec; 704f4e3455b6d2bdf9c0376786cbb149c2ee492b; 8f3511662d41f3bfee77115765dc0b0bc59ceace,Stem cell research,29,"

Here we describe a threshold-free method called continuous inflation analysis, which we used to compare genome-wide association statistics (GWAS) for the volumes of eight brain regions, computed from brain magnetic resonance imaging. Our goal was to understand the extent of pleiotropy (overlap in genetic influences) and concordance for the volumes of brain regions with different biological functions. We found significant pleiotropy among seven of the subcortical brain volumes. We found positive concordance across the seven subcortical structures and negative concordance between genetic influences on each subcortical structure and intracranial volume. Using a conditional false discovery rate approach, we showed that a given brain volume GWAS could act as a Bayesian prior and improve the power to detect novel associations in a related brain volume. When conditioning the putamen volume GWAS on the caudate volume GWAS, we identified 17 novel loci associated with putamen volume.",2017,Economics; Biology,"list(name = ""Derrek Paul Hibar"", ids = ""143978242""); list(name = ""Neda Jahanshad"", ids = ""1721831""); list(name = ""Sarah E.

399b716ee06dc8106c51e9fcac3ae5daa9f527d0,Expression-based Pathway Signature Analysis (EPSA): Mining publicly available microarray data for insight into human disease,"BackgroundPublicly available data repositories facilitate the sharing of an ever-increasing amount of microarray data. However, these datasets remain highly underutilized. Reutilizing the data could offer insights into questions and diseases entirely distinct from those considered in the original experimental design.MethodsWe first analyzed microarray datasets derived from known perturbations of specific pathways using the samr package in R to identify specific patterns of change in gene expression. We refer to these pattern of gene expression alteration as a ""pathway signatures."" We then used Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, a non-parametric measure of correlation, to determine similarities between pathway signatures and disease profiles, and permutation analysis to evaluate false discovery rate. This enabled detection of statistically significant similarity between these pathway signatures and corresponding changes observed in human disease. Finally, we evaluated pathway activation, as indicated by correlation with the pathway signature, as a risk factor for poor prognosis using multiple unrelated, publicly available datasets.ResultsWe have developed a novel method, Expression-based Pathway Signature Analysis (EPSA). We demonstrate that ESPA is a rigorous computational approach for statistically evaluating the degree of similarity between highly disparate sources of microarray expression data. We also show how EPSA can be used in a number of cases to stratify patients with differential disease prognosis. EPSA can be applied to many different types of datasets in spite of different platforms, different experimental designs, and different species. Applying this method can yield new insights into human disease progression.ConclusionEPSA enables the use of publicly available data for an entirely new, translational purpose to enable the identification of potential pathways of dysregulation in human disease, as well as potential leads for therapeutic molecular targets.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jessica D.

b7ac1b9acc91da1ac515f57bed18da8ea68c0d26,SAW: A Method to Identify Splicing Events from RNA-Seq Data Based on Splicing Fingerprints,"Splicing event identification is one of the most important issues in the comprehensive analysis of transcription profile. Recent development of next-generation sequencing technology has generated an extensive profile of alternative splicing. However, while many of these splicing events are between exons that are relatively close on genome sequences, reads generated by RNA-Seq are not limited to alternative splicing between close exons but occur in virtually all splicing events. In this work, a novel method, SAW, was proposed for the identification of all splicing events based on short reads from RNA-Seq. It was observed that short reads not in known gene models are actually absent words from known gene sequences. An efficient method to filter and cluster these short reads by fingerprint fragments of splicing events without aligning short reads to genome sequences was developed. Additionally, the possible splicing sites were also determined without alignment against genome sequences. A consensus sequence was then generated for each short read cluster, which was then aligned to the genome sequences. Results demonstrated that this method could identify more than 90% of the known splicing events with a very low false discovery rate, as well as accurately identify, a number of novel splicing events between distant exons.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kang Ning"", ids = ""1798946""); list(name = ""Damian Fermin"", ids = ""1923241"")",d960ab65aaa7b7073d12b5b14dbf36fd10c8d5e5; a54714eed8a5f82e0d41a56d6cd591b4167cbb1c; d838512a1e3f260fd195548a42c0fb1d29d2dfb7; 0df436746d3641fcf8d6fb2f2a4113981cbb79b4; 574cbbfd3d5fe63d7e454e780dc20e9dbe9b42ea,6ffaf0b5df3978e2ce35b0e6f51c65bdf6b67e7f; 7581dd80f38a16cb8a2e2100ed9996ca1a84c1b4; 049724305ed60528958073d0c64d39977bb82c72; dbb4fde6cd061f7ebd32f73ef37d312be7f010e6; 28673ee289bb8573f2b9814a447e0c6ebca909cf; 6e487ab063fc9b945cd2f0c3dfff6655290e3145; 42f3486128a5e5be1db9a8fe9a124e43f602a5c8; b00113c902b54d7ab320b3cc3988423ed88457dc; 7de8b5ce383f19493ec3b1407115970229885b61; 0fcf18c66fcf2a09ee46bcec3d7bf265915ef8f5; af56e6d4901dcd0f589bf969e604663d40f1be5d; 2878976835c73ed0906e17a7336b9bf10d491a1a; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; 2615097c06a257afc7b488147995feea06e242f3; 5498feb293c98371d47bea089938ba547983b79a; 02f56dca2decf3863dcead735f185e95a4bc6a84; b742e1b5f7b913512e8862cc79286203f6a9091f,PLoS ONE,5,

526832cbb398f335f02371399cf027970512eca1,Weighted mining of massive collections of $p$-values by convex optimization,"Researchers in data-rich disciplines---think of computational genomics and observational cosmology---often wish to mine large bodies of $p$-values looking for significant effects, while controlling the false discovery rate or family-wise error rate. Increasingly, researchers also wish to prioritize certain hypotheses, for example those thought to have larger effect sizes, by upweighting, and to impose constraints on the underlying mining, such as monotonicity along a certain sequence. 
We introduce Princessp, a principled method for performing weighted multiple testing by constrained convex optimization. Our method elegantly allows one to prioritize certain hypotheses through upweighting and to discount others through downweighting, while constraining the underlying weights involved in the mining process. When the $p$-values derive from monotone likelihood ratio families like the Gaussian means model, the new method allows exact solution of an important optimal weighting problem previously thought to be nonconvex and computationally infeasible. Our method scales to massive dataset sizes.

c12cd2ea2fb81f5a22d685fb87b6fe73dc6e8db4,A whole genome scan for differences in recombination rates among three Bos taurus breeds,"Abstract. Twenty paternal half-sib families of a granddaughter design were genotyped for 265 genetic markers, most of them microsatellites. These were 16 Holstein families, 3 Simmental families, and 1 Brown Swiss family. The number of sires per breed was 872, 170, and 32, respectively. Two-point recombination rates were estimated both jointly for all breeds and each single breed separately. Of 1168 marker intervals, 865 provided estimates for at least two breeds. Differences between breeds were tested by likelihood ratio tests. Four marker intervals, representing three genomic regions on BTA19, BTA24, and BTA27, show a significant impact of the breed at a false discovery rate of 0.23 and indicate a genetic component of observed heterogeneity of recombination. The variability of recombination rates between cattle breeds might not be a common feature of the whole genome, but rather might be restricted to certain chromosomal segments. Thus, attention should be paid to heterogeneities when pooling data of such regions from different breeds.",2001,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Hauke Thomsen"", ids = ""48494766""); list(name = ""Norbert Reinsch"", ids = ""2139427""); list(name = ""Ningying Xu"", ids = ""49183599""); list(name = ""JÃ¶rn Bennewitz"", ids = ""40393182""); list(name = ""Christian Looft"", ids = ""6764376""); list(name = ""Sven Grupe"", ids = ""47744291""); list(name = ""Christa KÃ¼hn"", ids = ""152209474""); list(name = ""Gudrun A.

6455775ecdbd5fd886f77ebc646d5f3d53496360,Model selection in a global analysis of a microarray experiment.,"Analysis of data from complementary DNA microarray experiments is an area of intense research. Options include models at the gene level or at the global level, the latter combining information from all of the profiled genes. In general, a joint analysis is expected to be more powerful than gene-specific analyses. Global analysis of microarray data requires fitting a model that jointly performs data normalization and analyses. The objective of this study was to assess the optimality of alternative models for data normalization and analysis in an experiment to identify differentially expressed genes between 2 muscles in AvileÃ±a Negra IbÃ©rica calves. Three major groups of models were explored according to several aspects including spatial arrangement of spots, other technical sources of variation such as dye effects, assumptions related to effects included in the model, and gene-specific effects. In addition, 3 sources of heterogeneity of residual variance were investigated. All models were compared by Bayes factors and cross-validation predictive densities. The model that included array-block, dye, muscle, and array-dye as systematic effects and all gene-related components as random effects was the best model for normalization and analysis of these data under heterogeneity of residual variances. Furthermore, level of intensity seemed to be the major source of heteroscedasticity for all models investigated. Such models rendered the best goodness of fit without compromising the predictive ability. The best model also provided the best performance to detect genes differentially expressed with the lowest false discovery rate. The large differences found for the model comparison criteria across models indicate the importance of defining the factors that more accurately account for experiment-wide variability to ensure correct inference on differential expression of genes. Our results also illustrate the importance of the experimental setup to account for possible sources of bias in the detection of differentially expressed genes.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Clara DÃ­az"", ids = ""77890204""); list(name = ""Natalia Moreno-SÃ¡nchez"", ids = ""1403128397""); list(name = ""JesÃºs Rueda"", ids = ""143695918""); list(name = ""Antonio Reverter"", ids = ""1884674""); list(name = ""Yonghong Wang"", ids = ""49416234""); list(name = ""MarÃ­a JesÃºs CarabaÃ±o"", ids = ""4763464"")",a4deb6cbecd20880d20c7dcb641b56049112d905; 117c143efc52ec47d838b6dd046a00fe308722de; 4900b01ec513b6927454314b3a0dd583edb1bfb5,1c89a34897bbd30b4fbb6ce201b87e9f7bc54f38,Journal of animal science,87 1,"

Ischemic stroke is the end phenotype of a complex interaction between various genetic and environmental factors.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed to explore association of two lipid-relevant genetic variants and conventional risk factors with risk of having ischemic stroke in Northern Han Chinese.


METHODS
Genotyping was performed in 396 ischemic stroke patients and 396 controls that were all recruited from the four hospitals of Qiqihar city. Data were analyzed using chi(2) test, logistic regression and haplotype analyses.


RESULTS
Significant differences were observed for genotype and allele distributions of APOE epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 polymorphism (P<0.001) with epsilon4 allele conferring a 2.19-fold risky effect (P<0.001), while no statistical differences were found for LDLR C1773T distributions. Haplotype analysis indicated the remarkable differences for haplotypes harboring APOE ""epsilon2"" or ""epsilon4"" alleles between cases and controls after the stringent Bonferroni correction. Moreover, all multiple-testing associations remained significant using false discovery rate (FDR) method. Further our multiple logistic regression analysis showed significant associations of hypertension status (OR=5.37, P<0.001) and APOE epsilon2 (OR=0.45, P<0.001) and epsilon4 (OR=1.50, P=0.003) alleles with ischemic stroke after controlling confounders, and their correlations with plasma lipid profiles were strengthened by stratification of alleles and hypertension status combined.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results not only demonstrated potential interactions of APOE epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 and LDLR C1773T polymorphisms with risk of having ischemic stroke, but also added the evidence of independent role of hypertension and APOE epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 polymorphism in the development of this disorder in Northern Han Chinese.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bin Wang"", ids = ""47780694""); list(name = ""Hongye Zhao"", ids = ""4054284""); list(name = ""Li Zhou"", ids = ""2489944""); list(name = ""X Dai"", ids = ""143997119""); list(name = ""Wenquan Niu"", ids = ""144494405"")",612acabbed8498c1aed3060cf1d954d686399f3d; 30e9d604ca07c61043be7cd2c6825f5d0a82b3b3; 04115581c261ee27db23ad323c7bf0f851f77bca; d77896555dfec4cc1b7ebd9639a8d9ef639a930e; 7e86a919c2872e4e6135aa439bb6c9a0fdc08334; 363bf554f0342c7f9269eb70a10764b42639f4a5; dd7e4707e6fd4ffccb6d53152973fa46eb33ea1b; 8bec1ea5b6d5d04abde5c49bbff887fa07e73815; 57174351bf480c42ffc04fc5c0d505e65b1f8c5e; b1560dfa093d171b9e91dc02f79a9ac9330ef8bb; 3d59f8a60dfaa24ef33bed64b4037e00788cdee9; cb1fe2495eb42f8df45265f3c07363d2bba7c2e6; 28db1309d2865086e1d9400321ea0716739c3b4f; 3529a5b6ccda13678e2d429e68dad28990e09873; e798e90864fe05ec4043e91614a9e228b1ce5693; beedfb9e3cbf542eeaed594cc0a1e9511da091eb; f32566624be18df015b0f14407955ebb8b3848a4; 347322204bead82859effbef9cceedeccd793eee; aecb5d166aa7585a47a95d01d463764d4a4d914e; 5470873b39964205c0170aa5fd6ae7e64c604449; c2eec07c014f63a7444af24c6a2fca7a6db4afb4; fefadff4203c41a242394a53f0716d6579b8269b,,Journal of the Neurological Sciences,276,118-122
8249404366d4cee731525adc3db0cc9a7e6638da,Low-Dose Irradiation Alters the Transcript Profiles of Human Lymphoblastoid Cells Including Genes Associated with Cytogenetic Radioadaptive Response,"Abstract Coleman, M. A., Yin, E., Peterson, L. E., Nelson, D., Sorensen, K., Tucker, J. D. and Wyrobek, A. J. Low-Dose Irradiation Alters the Transcript Profiles of Human Lymphoblastoid Cells Including Genes Associated with Cytogenetic Radioadaptive Response. Radiat. Res. 164, 369â€“382 (2005). Low-dose ionizing radiation alters the gene expression profiles of mammalian cells, yet there is little understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms responsible for these changes or of their consequences for genomic stability. We investigated the cytogenetic adaptive response of human lymphoblastoid cell lines exposed to 5 cGy (priming dose) followed by 2 Gy (challenge dose) compared to cells that received a single 2-Gy dose to (a) determine how the priming dose influences subsequent gene transcript expression in reproducibly adapting and non-adapting cell lines, and (b) identify gene transcripts that are associated with reductions in the magnitude of chromosomal damage after the challenge dose. The transcript profiles were evaluated using oligonucleotide arrays and RNA obtained 4 h after the challenge dose. A set of 145 genes (false discovery rate = 5%) with transcripts that were affected by the 5-cGy priming dose fell into two categories: (a) a set of common genes that were similarly modulated by the 5-cGy priming dose irrespective of whether the cells subsequently adapted or not and (b) genes with differential transcription in accordance with the cell lines that showed either adaptive or non-adaptive outcomes. The common priming-dose response genes showed up-regulation for protein synthesis genes and down-regulation of metabolic and signal transduction genes (>10-fold differences). The genes associated with subsequent adaptive and non-adaptive outcomes involved DNA repair, stress response, cell cycle control and apoptosis. Our findings support the importance of TP53-related functions in the control of the low-dose cytogenetic radioadaptive response and suggest that certain low-dose-induced alterations in cellular functions are predictive for the risk of subsequent genomic damage.",2005,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Matthew A.

183209f37f3b4ce2f9fefeec9af7d002ef244a98,Capillary Zone Electrophoresis-Tandem Mass Spectrometry with Activated Ion Electron Transfer Dissociation for Large-scale Top-down Proteomics.,"Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has been recognized as an efficient approach for top-down proteomics recently for its high-capacity separation and highly sensitive detection of proteoforms. However, the commonly used collision-based dissociation methods often cannot provide extensive fragmentation of proteoforms for thorough characterization. Activated ion electron transfer dissociation (AI-ETD), that combines infrared photoactivation concurrent with ETD, has shown better performance for proteoform fragmentation than higher energy-collisional dissociation (HCD) and standard ETD. Here, we present the first application of CZE-AI-ETD on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer for large-scale top-down proteomics of Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells. CZE-AI-ETD outperformed CZE-ETD regarding proteoform and protein identifications (IDs). CZE-AI-ETD reached comparable proteoform and protein IDs with CZE-HCD. CZE-AI-ETD tended to generate better expectation values (E values) of proteoforms than CZE-HCD and CZE-ETD, indicating a higher quality of MS/MS spectra from AI-ETD respecting the number of sequence-informative fragment ions generated. CZE-AI-ETD showed great reproducibility regarding the proteoform and protein IDs with relative standard deviations less than 4% and 2% (nâ€‰=â€‰3). Coupling size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to CZE-AI-ETD identified 3028 proteoforms and 387 proteins from E. coli cells with 1% spectrum level and 5% proteoform-level false discovery rates. The data represents the largest top-down proteomics dataset using the AI-ETD method so far. Single-shot CZE-AI-ETD of one SEC fraction identified 957 proteoforms and 253 proteins. N-terminal truncations, signal peptide cleavage, N-terminal methionine removal, and various post-translational modifications including protein N-terminal acetylation, methylation, S-thiolation, disulfide bonds, and lysine succinylation were detected.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Elijah N.

cba2ad759448d056ff7a5a67cca0d1e9e50d1ac1,A fully-automatic fast segmentation of the sub-basal layer nerves in corneal images,"Corneal nerves changes have been linked to damage caused by surgical interventions or prolonged contact lens wear. Furthermore nerve tortuosity has been shown to correlate with the severity of diabetic neuropathy. For these reasons there has been an increasing interest on the analysis of these structures. In this work we propose a novel, robust, and fast fully automatic algorithm capable of tracing the sub-basal plexus nerves from human corneal confocal images. We resort to logGabor filters and support vector machines to trace the corneal nerves. The proposed algorithm traced most of the corneal nerves correctly (sensitivity of 0.88 Â± 0.06 and false discovery rate of 0.08 Â± 0.06). The displayed performance is comparable to a human grader. We believe that the achieved processing time (0.661 Â± 0.07 s) and tracing quality are major advantages for the daily clinical practice.",2014,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Pedro GuimarÃ£es"", ids = ""144672651""); list(name = ""Jeffrey Wigdahl"", ids = ""1813547""); list(name = ""Enea Poletti"", ids = ""2313841""); list(name = ""Alfredo Ruggeri"", ids = ""27589571"")",2d4231eb6da0339aedd9632a1aefc1d52dad7a37; d8ac724bba8c7f84f823b7bc8a74dadbde5304ca; ca04adaf61482ce85eb896dff22b6dbf7b87db5f,0fb280a700dffab6f0ee268ca7e2b1480027be9b; b0c621dd6fdd000265d73d7607ed270ac258ad9f; 234907c600a71ef50f24ace9b81a55f947ff8d7e; b183546f6c30c79a7b4ac6f58593554276867755; d39ab151841a65fc92ebd9c924a0f4e1ddff736d; 4e234772b283e9e274791ed25911c20e08e6c462; 25d29583ec1961029fa0117a1e3038eaacd19d6f; 273dfbcb68080251f5e9ff38b4413d7bd84b10a1; 6818668fb895d95861a2eb9673ddc3a41e27b3b3; 6a5822ef26f0235c64e1c7c1391ffb30eda9a37a; 389113070226e5b30f4de2f7aa266b2265d6c9ee; e96933a280d7a10c686b8d68a06d01cebc1bf99c; 90311a9aed41340f8820f288f4f24a5e7c4baef5; fcf9fc4e23b45345c2404ce7d6cb0fc9dea2c9ec; 74b3e6ca1216bb420cd48167c0b4d998945ab8f2; 5c08a514f95b5b26c2639e1fc06a202e133bbc8a,2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,,5422-5425
a6905378857bf8b0a8f5bf1f971ed4d3d30b2ef9,HLA Haplotypes Are Associated with Multiple Myeloma Risk in the African American Multiple Myeloma Study (AAMMS),"Background: Persons of African ancestry (AA) have a 2-3-fold higher risk of multiple myeloma (MM) than persons of European ancestry (EA). Like other B-cell malignancies, genome-wide association scans (GWAS) have identified MM risk variants in the HLA region in persons of EA. We conducted a case-control analysis with data from the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)1comprising MM patients typed for bone marrow transplant to donor controls matched by race-ethnicity, and found associations between specific HLA alleles/haplotypes and MM risk that varied by race and ethnicity. To confirm our results and identify additional novel signals, we have now investigated associations between HLA alleles and haplotypes and MM risk in the African American Multiple Myeloma Study (AAMMS) Cohort. Methods: The source of subjects was the AAMMS, in which AA MM patients were identified from 10 cancer centers and 4 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results (SEER) Program cancer registries in order to identify genetic risk factors for MM among AAs. A GWAS was conducted using the Illumina Human Core BeadChip array on DNA samples from 1,305 AA MM patients in the AAMMS comparing results to those from 7,078 AA controls with GWAS data generated from the Illumina 1MDuo2. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were imputed to classical HLA variants using HIBAG. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate HLA associations, adjusting for sex, age and the first 2 principal components. P-values were adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR) for each locus group. Results: We did not identify any single HLA alleles associated with MM risk among AAs. However, several B*07:02-containing haplotypes were associated with MM risk (odds ratios [OR] ranging from 2.38 to 2.64 and FDR P-values ranging from 1.43 x 10-6 to 3.57 x 10-8). We found associations between MM risk and genotypes containing DRB3*02:02, including DRB3*02:02~DRB1*11:01+ DRB3*02:02~DRB1*11:01 (OR=1.93, PFDR= 9.36 x 10-5) similar to those observed in the NMDP study1. Novel findings included associations between MM risk and HLA Class I haplotypes B*53:01+ B*57:01 (OR=1.94, PFDR= 0.003) and C04:01~B*53:01+C*06:02~B*57:01 (OR=1.96, PFDR= 0.0050). Results from an ongoing meta-analysis between the two data sets (one based on an imputed GWAS and one based on NMDP HLA typing) will be presented. Conclusions: This study is the second to examine HLA alleles and risk of MM among AA9s and is by far the largest. We confirmed a previously observed association between an HLA Class II DRB3 variant and MM risk and confirmed an association with B*07 haplotypes previously observed among EAs1. We also identified novel associations between other HLA Class I haplotypes and MM risk in AA9s. Because HLA is highly polymorphic, many HLA alleles are rare variants for which genetic associations are difficult to detect without very large sample sizes. Further investigation with large sample sizes will be necessary to refine these associations in order to better identify the underlying causal alleles and determine the functional significance of these HLA associations. 1Beksac M, Gragert L, Fingerson S, et al.: HLA polymorphism and risk of multiple myeloma.Leukemia. 2016 Jul 27. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.199. 2Rand KA, Song C, Hwang AE, et al.

1a0c3fcdae93feecfaaa9cc2859f059479d57f7f,An alternative pruning based approach to unbiased recursive partitioning,"Tree-based methods are a non-parametric modelling strategy that can be used in combination with generalized linear models or Cox proportional hazards models, mostly at an exploratory stage. Their popularity is mainly due to the simplicity of the technique along with the ease in which the resulting model can be interpreted. Variable selection bias from variables with many possible splits or missing values has been identified as one of the problems associated with tree-based methods. A number of unbiased recursive partitioning algorithms have been proposed that avoid this bias by using p -values in the splitting procedure of the algorithm. The final tree is obtained using direct stopping rules (pre-pruning strategy) or by growing a large tree first and pruning it afterwards (post-pruning). Some of the drawbacks of pre-pruned trees based on p -values in the presence of interaction effects and a large number of explanatory variables are discussed, and a simple alternative post-pruning solution is presented that allows the identification of such interactions. The proposed method includes a novel pruning algorithm that uses a false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure for the determination of splits corresponding to significant tests. The new approach is demonstrated with simulated and real-life examples.",2017,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Alberto Alvarez-Iglesias"", ids = ""1399572049""); list(name = ""John Hinde"", ids = ""144782191""); list(name = ""John Ferguson"", ids = ""145782127""); list(name = ""John Newell"", ids = ""48376070"")",98120b390de5de17662acd6bdfbdb49d8073a373,7591298e447db01db4f3b799a9937ed9b98b69fc; 8a438f6a68b101b5ab66973d8c61c056f2e88195; fef1250e6784ca2fa007d71f1e598be3cfa0a140; a835dfe3726ee46001c0fcbdd09fa308c0748f81; 5447b71c96aaff6400ccf4267f373f184eec07d2; afe9ea6acd258a7f09f5686a629bfc514d1502a8; 072d09ba865b5c2cfac279696c555730f0cdbce4; c4625b78634985bb98fe4e1289d6ee220c3fb8e2; 957728a4244d3b323e98e351098a0125382f1199; cd9400ce555bea3901f145976a120b1010ed0706; 46b6018bf921cb814274d4ec9fa15767090757e9; 3280902c91d6213fb4fad8bba14925676bcdf717; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a0c88b49fcdc36c76c913f0a74afa60f5626789a; 297e6802cf71adc7a3e018a416ad0bcac86697da; 2134ce7f8e0f2f59a50306a84dbc9c91cdb04718; 4544ec96d5ec6e71f7795fa5498f542cb9985c7a; 1bddf0884c1629f77833eb59b8fa76fe02773bab; 0d4164ac5591c5a42ef3c2d819e82a978dbfddc3,Comput.

ad6bfb92c99fc5fed67fb7a755a84bd07333c785,A novel transcriptomic based approach to the detection of recombinant human erythropoietin doping,"Administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) improves endurance performance. Hence rHuEpo is, allegedly, frequently subject to abuse by athletes, although rHuEpo is prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency. A transcriptomic-based longitudinal screening approach has the potential to improve further the performance of current detection methods. AIM: To assess the effects of rHuEpo on blood gene expression profiles in order to identify a â€œmolecular signatureâ€ of rHuEpo doping. METHODS: 19 Caucasian trained males at sea-level (Scotland â€“ SCO) and 20 Kenyan endurance runners at moderate altitude (~2,150 m, Kenya â€“ KEN) received rHuEpo injections of 50 IUâˆ™kg-1 body mass every two days for 4 weeks. Blood was obtained 2 weeks before, during and 4 weeks after administration. 3,000 m time trial performance was measured pre, post administration and at the end of the study. RNA was extracted from blood stabilized in Tempus RNA tubes, amplified, labelled and hybridized to Illumina HumanHT-12v4 Expression BeadChips. Expression data was analyzed using Rank Products with a 5% false discovery rate and an additional 1.5 fold-change threshold. A subset of target and housekeeping genes was further validated using QuantiGene Plex assay. RESULTS: Despite markedly different baseline values between SCO and KEN, as exemplified by the haematocrit (41.9 Â± 1.8% vs. 45.3 Â± 2.6, p 0.188). These results confirmed that the perturbation involving rHuEpo worked effectively. Relative to baseline, the expression of hundreds of genes were found to be altered by rHuEpo. In particular, 30 transcripts were already differentially expressed two days after the first injection while 15 transcripts were profoundly up-regulated during and subsequently down-regulated up to 4 weeks post administration in both groups. Importantly, the same pattern was observed in all subjects. The functions of the discovered genes were mainly related to either the functional or structural properties of the erythrocyte or to the cell cycle and its regulation. CONCLUSION: This research successfully identified the blood â€œmolecular signatureâ€ of rHuEpo administration and provides the strongest evidence to date that gene biomarkers have the potential to substantially improve the performance of current anti-doping methods such as the Athlete Biological Passport for rHuEpo detection.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""JÃ©rÃ´me Durussel"", ids = ""49235867"")",,6fb6c65302880b94dc51ebe79bc2120b875c1688; c72c5d4d0f2e69bc4605478adcb1a0aec77d750b; 68fc48fabee2874107e25e2db122d665f9900f03; 34f90ba49f2dd7a8bd655a81e6b7537545e9e3e9; 50aa84dac933e5c80d2d2b72c1ebdd2483b9234c; 06a77799fa23ec3a99162287cd894d5f42f51db8; f7b886a3ccd077179c01c074f1351d9b9695fc3c; 4d5e566249e791c466a74e660799b27e1d472723; bb69ef205429d31b6ea7c2f3c26f02a8f888cdd3; 8a85a603a8db36941e694c0662907598092fc840; 68ab6e71b3b273e223af2c459f8c60cec521fdf5; a0c6e88ed548ee3673e1569cbb62536357640e4d; ad3b016ae9938dea52e4461f299743b4415963f2; 06ec6d61a0e15aeed648bdbba06652f261ac44e8; b3bf03bc2f86ef38b6e0b0fe3c61c2720da500ea; 0f2df43d688a82fd28caa4f68f711708238bb7c1; a08b15d4b03bebbd50bb2779af1d51a84f34d766; fb2c99b8acaf47c47b32e7d8bc3ffdbc06c35b67; 5a8da2d5c34dcc6390fb56349abc0d9b6750f471; efe5373977aaff753717a84d3c1b323c0fd8084d; 1fdde5b0cb16d7650965b306398a92ddf060d813; 295ac511ec9953f177c1cf9fb50487112207fce7; a89fd4566fcd5a218074d96fc7406d93564a8193; 09ac7bc5fec87fd74499143d31c0c6a3efd4441a; 049b1b4f937c210facbffdf5bdc02881005df08f; 9aa2d4346774ce8a5a036c81f0c5fe0381fa863f; b5e5ab3600ed84c0924b9874f95221ad8b17a952; 73772090069b3a238f7ec8574f8d884ad9cb4ebf; 413dc3dbc1887b25c102d6b316fff6ff00f37274; b325aacf64e32fdf7fd115ed181134e1dbc5f647; 9f78408d949f68a95a90647f539e1cc208bca382; 517e9d33f5fee8e519b9225bd47cd4b1de7f905a; 4ffd8490e0eb0b41e792850542ad0d7bf1a5e5c9; 0b37b92aeb120ccece8d0d1165a7352c3a0e4da8; 66f9552b086d6f858b35cde0090364f9201fe1da; bfdbe47d969a8f2c67338d077eb320c0c1c0606a; 7afaddffaaf03bba3b4eb1ea2695eb28954204ab; 499471b58ce0d2b31845bc2c929f7c2dca546d5b; f1c2de5cf87c34618f6d8c038e79d143fd653ba2; eddef5c559de9cabe10df77e76de39d06f843681; 6075b19b431d4be3f7e43e57a175606858fb6d53; 271d2d50b2124faa0f4dab1c695066ffe14f3163; 392e9f895a681e47313cdf7fd6ee1bc410229c37; 36fbe384462a12605aba12691409806f67a07e8d; 6d54ad2e795f33b589fa63aa4aac4e7ca9bf8408; d089377e9db3dc2190246ee345f2dc113fae9cd5; 3694acf7406a0acf7c4fb89c0de528713f88e089; 7e3791397bdb724f09e194d2609d92c9465e271a; 056d0ff64404162aaab2685cd867c1813defcd7e; 2016d7134c6e17e1c9d4bd8479c84e2c0b148183; 5e231d9f22222e23cfbd2ddd20c6deb1689bc858; 7caa8034a3927bb8a583c1d62210c66242647abb; 7a1feb3f775fcb5c34b50a03dc8cef713771a7eb; ebd3c4dc28f92842a539eaded4e63bc193466204; bcdbe7a382a1b7b538855164b6593c15d9e1cc9f; a1c2c1665c74c3c899fddee924d58a0604816ae0; 1b28bae6d4827a48c8ad6b5162a2243c0170adbf; 00ac936683a5dbac54628a294118f9f1d9363a06; b9ee30d800acdccd9afdaa10dafaa4e2484bfb78; 0498ecdf8a2723f7d36459149616336be378b0cd; 6b8202e2a24851f6c3c961bfa4120a96d11fbc17; 2e061bad942d16e25a1d67685da882756e8c38bd; a2cf07da3a524840c1829c49fcf123502f894b29; 4c6853e176a915dacf9ab7c6c78ea50ee12f0480; ecb194a1b05c46ac519f2af753dcf0854d8c3475; 4d5a0089d443de3f14ba1f750c8c844eb980b59f; 69c50652d88203bc8e04b5d5fc1ecbefc9779c83; e19fcd4236d0def74ed7ff6a31e23d7035cd89c3; c37fa1d165f9ed206be067e8f1f642f152999b11; e37d9bc1e0a564d58e83e16da0823b0db65713b0; 0ce19c587a4d22be714fe97e6e7608806151b553; b8433c5da14ce467b7dcfdec8bc195c26befe9ef; f3a794cec080717b4d6bd0be752df328272e29af; f8f2e85b702c8e30433301a221ed46368210f790; b5f206811bca38db85a238ff702100d006b74200; bc692185f4e09cfea6e4f18eea7266c7d0af1882; bb3488c1317e6d86f3f732ad8452d86d8c3510fc; 0f17c8fd4b306f179201f740466699d2d5c7a1d8; 65feb644002cc990697aead65a9fa2751f8e9309; 4c3979f4583218d94434a4af4ffd57ccfb7a23b9; 9c4f0d2df433a1ac107cc26c25d255fa53968884; 8b112d994211654e4b32fa6eb952b9022818e3bf; d404ab5e8a39e29eb3627a63d3b19f9a9f698a10; c94f7030b66f77b4bcf4295657c62754f01e72d2; 4e468de6d528b8cdebc4cc2987646c1de19b4ad9; 7615b802ad5d65b395044f5fe8e267b989a6bd76; 7d6b03c30153fd75df8fc9ce0df4990e48681962; a35aeb5e0593a7bba5e11b411608c183b3bf5979; f032c38b1543f5956775a6eb1faa9e33153508a7; 20b990743d7032beed6418521c70d042286508cb; f4442ae62f768e03ef2120ae6781eae43fa49735; 7731b3101954ac67f822f1d84480ad01bf6a0a12; abce79bccfe172077d070320f0cf6db4c698e596; 5270221ce85b8a239f3e37f05b9cd6234e4abb1d; bc2ce757c1abc645c7c0c4b177f3d258f45981b1; cf724ab9330cb6e29daf810672e512741bbc8149; 880ff9a2d1b63cc77e6fcf02a68a38ab8439bcc3; bf1d575a010adca2896dd4c4bba35d87916619f0; 6b92290d4a840260eeaac64ea75c29a33e13c4de; 85179b5341663ef3ad0b8938592fc606da0ae5b3; 294611f089e009f8718c7100126344125c67ac18; 7e92a528257d39ba009ae23a4148da617ecd93b5,,,
ebcd7cfebdd5cd40a55745431a61c68980b669ba,AB0156 Quantitative Proteomic Approaches for Identifying Urinary Biomarkers in Lupus Nephritis,"Background Lupus nephritis (LN) is a severe clinical manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Assessment of severity and activity of renal involvement in SLE requires a kidney biopsy, an invasive procedure with limited prognostic value. Despite years of research, a need remains for proximal, non-invasive biomarkers to help inform treatment decisions and to monitor disease activity and progression. Recent retrospective studies have revealed that baseline urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) and reduction in UPCR during induction therapy are significantly associated with renal outcome 1 . Although proteinuria is highly correlated with disease progression in LN, the composition of the urinary proteome of LN patients remains poorly characterized. Objectives To better characterize the urinary LN proteome, we performed a preliminary proteomics study comprised of three complimentary discovery proteomic methods to identify urinary biomarkers of LN. Methods Urine samples from three female patients with biopsy confirmed LN, high proteinuria (>3 mg/mmol, and low serum complement C3 ( Results Using these combined approaches >2600 proteins were identified, 290 of which are up-regulated >2-fold in LN samples compared to healthy controls. While the chemical labeling approach enabled identification of more total proteins (2,598 with chemical labeling vs. 919 with DIA, 1% False Discovery Rate), the DIA approach outperformed the chemical labeling approach in identification of proteins significantly up-regulated in LN samples (52 with chemical labeling vs. 173 with DIA). Conclusions These results suggest that DIA-based approaches are less biased towards high abundance analytes and therefore potentially more suitable for proteomic profiling of biological matrices with a broad dynamic range like urine. Furthermore, candidate biomarkers identified using the DIA method are easily adapted into a targeted, multiplexed mass spectrometry assay suitable for absolute quantitation of candidate biomarkers in a clinical trial. Results from this study will be used to inform longitudinal and interventional studies focused on understanding the biological implications of these candidate biomarkers and to direct development of novel tools to evaluate disease progression and treatment efficacy of current and future LN therapeutics.

0626042ab84767dfa43465bc784188236b7c0628,Guest Editor's Note: Computer-Intensive Methods with Emphasis On Bootstrap and Medical Research Applications,"In the late 1970s when computing was considered getting fast, Brad Efron and some other statisticians and computer scientists were recognizing that brute force computing could finally be realistically used in statistical inference. The bootstrap, permutation methods, and Markov-chain Monte Carlo became fixtures of statistical research during the period from 1980 up to the present. Also, data mining moved from being a badword to something that can be embraced, andmultiple searching can be accounted for with new concepts such as false discovery rate. With the complete mapping of the human genome and the advent of microarrays for studying gene expression, new and computer-intensive statistical techniques were needed to address the complexities of the problems and the newly available massive data sets. This has touched all branches of science, as well as marketing and management. Certainly it has had a place in biology and pharmaceuticals. To make this clear, the topic of computer-intensive methods with emphasis on bootstrap and medical research applications was chosen for this special issue of the Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics. It is fitting that the first article is by Brad Efron on the topic of Markovchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the bootstrap. In the article Efron describes the similarities between MCMC and the bootstrap and illustrates with a simple problem where a Bayesian analysis based on MCMC benefits from the use of either a parametric or a nonparametric bootstrap. Efronâ€™s article is followed by Gunter et al., â€œVariable Selection for Qualitative Interactions in Personalized Medicine While Controlling the Family-Wise Error Rate,â€ discussing an approach that is particularly important in clinical trial data analysis because it picks out variables that, although they may not be the best predictors of response, are certainly important because they are variables that interact with the response in a way that might cause the physician to change treatment for individual patients. There are many issues associated with variable selection, and Gunter et al. deal with the problem of multiple testing that is inherent in subset selection procedures (e.g., stepwise selection procedures).",2011,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael R.

1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c,Adapting to unknown sparsity by controlling the false discovery rate,"We attempt to recover an n-dimensional vector observed in white noise, where n is large and the vector is known to be sparse, but the degree of sparsity is unknown. We consider three different ways of defining sparsity of a vector: using the fraction of nonzero terms; imposing power-law decay bounds on the ordered entries; and controlling the lp norm for p small. We obtain a procedure which is asymptotically minimax for l r loss, simultaneously throughout a range of such sparsity classes. The optimal procedure is a data-adaptive thresholding scheme, driven by control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR). FDR control is a relatively recent innovation in simultaneous testing, ensuring that at most a certain fraction of the rejected null hypotheses will correspond to false rejections. In our treatment, the FDR control parameter qn also plays a determining role in asymptotic minimaxity. If q = lim qn âˆˆ [0,1/2] and also qn > Î³/log(n) we get sharp asymptotic minimaxity, simultaneously, over a wide range of sparse parameter spaces and loss functions. On the other hand, q = lim qn âˆˆ (1/2,1], forces the risk to exceed the minimax risk by a factor growing with q. To our knowledge, this relation between ideas in simultaneous inference and asymptotic decision theory is new. Our work provides a new perspective on a class of model selection rules which has been introduced recently by several authors. These new rules impose complexity penalization of the form 2 ï¿½ log( potential model size / actual model size ). We exhibit a close connection with FDR-controlling procedures under stringent control of the false discovery rate.",2005,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Felix Abramovich"", ids = ""2025123""); list(name = ""Yoav Benjamini"", ids = ""50679934""); list(name = ""David L.

b6b12cfe342067acd37bc0274e7f35d271afcbe0,Transcriptional profiling of feline infectious peritonitis virus infection in CRFK cells and in PBMCs from FIP diagnosed cats,"BackgroundFeline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is a lethal systemic disease, caused by the FIP Virus (FIPV); a virulent mutant of Feline Enteric Coronavirus (FECV). Currently, the viruses virulence determinants and host gene expressions during FIPV infection are not fully understood.MethodsRNA sequencing of Crandell Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells, infected with FIPV strain 79â€“1146 at 3 hours post infection (h.p.i), were sequenced using the Illumina next generation sequencing approach. Bioinformaticâ€™s analysis, based on Felis catus 2X annotated shotgun reference genome, using CLC bio Genome Workbench mapped both control and infected cell reads to 18899 genes out of 19046 annotated genes. Kalâ€™s Z test statistical analysis was used to analyse the differentially expressed genes from the infected CRFK cells. Real time RT-qPCR was developed for further transcriptional profiling of three genes (PD-1, PD-L1 and A3H) in infected CRFK cells and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from healthy and FIP-diseased cats.ResultsBased on Kalâ€™s Z-test, with False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.05 and >1.99 fold change on gene expressions, a total of 61 genes were differentially expressed by both samples, where 44 genes were up-regulated and the remainder were down-regulated. Most genes were closely clustered together, suggesting a homogeneous expression. The majority of the genes that were significantly regulated, were those associated with monocytes-macrophage and Th1 cell functions, and the regulation of apoptosis. Real time RT-qPCR developed focusing on 2 up-regulated genes (PD-L1 and A3H) together with an apoptosis associated gene PD-1 expressions in FIPV infected CRFK cells and in PBMCs from healthy and FIP diagnosed cats produced concordant results with transcriptome data.ConclusionThe possible roles of these genes, and their importance in feline coronaviruses infection, are discussed.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mohammad Syamsul Reza Harun"", ids = ""5306892""); list(name = ""Choong Oi Kuan"", ids = ""5592880""); list(name = ""Gayathri Thevi Selvarajah"", ids = ""3867218""); list(name = ""Tan Sheau Wei"", ids = ""40472365""); list(name = ""Siti Suri Arshad"", ids = ""3011828""); list(name = ""Mohd Hair Bejo"", ids = ""5209704""); list(name = ""Abdul Rahman Bin Omar"", ids = ""52177072"")",66a6a5cb7b41fb6edd030629be7c455c079f47bf; 6c3023e983a638d2259f291cbe280578554bc5bb; ff47306a2c697b834025798441bdf26daf8b3c60; d2541d62f17ca8ee6ba7a6f03dca29b7a675ff12; 2355a349cbd11961bf9d141811c2336ba365563d; 9b0a00a98ecc9503c928d30e7cd30a0a56b196f0; 8f30a867d5a2d71ce0a64963f9ddda53102e0175; c04a69b7e1b0b642d84d105c8931353996b19e04; e0b414d488d8bb0f3b28f8fcedb8d1555e563029; e78773f693dbd7f7ece3286263bbff2f9928574f; 0dd1b0f6338742e9e3d896b7f816011992d3aaa8; 828f87454dd05574362637d59bf3d468da576a61; ebd781f1bacf68fbaa6efa2aff4390c20a405999,7730ae7a5b81adf9168a39252e0be8fed9a0ef7e; 8b521c7d9b2581a0ab4e3221fbf97df2e6b486ba; 48fe5b7f2cf07f58c158902bfb9ec8dd6257da93; c6ee4ab7ec836b9a9c751f7b48b319d9ace13b5e; e20f76ad9dd64f56631aa6dcaec8503b8b4e0ac8; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; 9cf48ebf7dbd9e617585abbd68c7935d399913d3; 79d8cd6dc8f8c55162612d4ce38da626c3d91ed2; 80b382c7f695942fc787a2a97d9fa186d3be9386; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; c58ed5382c8d01d45f250cec0c412db078d4f4d2; 386c851f61544084d59557dfdf9da8a2906689ff; f1c062a94ab24e7383a25d6d7c36d8d3a2d36e89; 798fa01a64b091ca57dfe94922089a2ee52ff48c; 63788c4bfc530f72ef2ee4506412faf98f9e0570; 888dbcac2a725e458b6b83175361a752115ddf37; b00bc5b3e12b99992401e760a6a8e070c0e9cf34; 070eb63031af260d840534b33fd8385b7152fda6; c56b8b11404891835d393d0740ff3b6874692bed; 16441b5e1dfa1a4de0e1521d7eda2806cbce2d3a; 81cd0d4f30bf150b3f46b0aa32a761c3e11e2812; 344cbca937f1fb12deb512314bd3b83aa1e160a7; a76bfc9015aa46288f9a042085f5ed453b457812; de0151c125d9c1b952370d7fd0a92d985fdff95d; 2cd7adc91059899ed1adf8cb42a37cb4cd7a486d; 9ea7488f842f416e2bf5c417eac4dd9c2d7109ba; b5e4bbde88479d069840558148e0f0a2e6116c3a; 5cad6c001d2fb9fb5f7c8e08755aff520c83f417; 9992ed959c9454efef4089fe8d71db2f1af3351e; 1a00e340917294fa11f66819a8983f6ba808ca4f; 09062e21cd6a3b2402016bdfa835339110f8b2e1; 8df50539b24a29b855a4a4d0f11bc885cad27699; f1c7a85f4275af5ddf2b71106a4621860e840b4b; 29d66d40cd3955590ffadd7c322045f18ebaad6b; 3ed78a87b3f7faaaf40a57fcdfb9490d621468a8; 1da9b7beb1d2e4e6676be44c34b004b4e29bd915; c14c365a50d70ed188fab87d069a254d177be59a,Virology Journal,10,329 - 329
8d2c4ff9b2d9299badff3b17740f744b8880b5b2,A Generalized Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure for Multivariate Hypothesis Testing,"The introduction of the false discovery rate (FDR) by Benjamini and Hochberg has spurred a great interest in developing methodologies to control the FDR in various settings. The majority of existing approaches, however, address the FDR control for the case where an appropriate univariate test statistic is available. Modern hypothesis testing and data integration applications, on the other hand, routinely involve multivariate test statistics. The goal, in such settings, is to combine the evidence for each hypothesis and achieve greater power, while controlling the number of false discoveries. This paper considers data-adaptive methods for constructing nested rejection regions based on multivariate test statistics (z-values). It is proved that the FDR can be controlled for appropriately constructed rejection regions, even when the regions depend on data and are hence random. This flexibility is then exploited to develop optimal multiple comparison procedures in higher dimensions, where the distribution of non-null z-values is unknown. Results are illustrated using simulated and real data.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Kasra Alishahi"", ids = ""1694256""); list(name = ""Ahmad Reza Ehyaei"", ids = ""47515476""); list(name = ""Ali Shojaie"", ids = ""2204469"")",24b9bbf8a420f1013d7d08e49a17f6e116b8f06e,715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 07811c68763d350c4501d3dba877ca7b53e29367; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a97e8af759381536766a5c2dfcb611fa0066c93c; fd4b45dcbdca97567ef0b0a085824a5044d884d4; 0b9d10bdb1d86124420f28d2ad4e628224f18332; eddb3766525ad09e831933782f9d210e15449065; 0cc325ee022c258b30da3247a60828f7adf4d14c; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98; 4440efc12b63fd87c8e9336ea39ee35b33d8c1c7; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; 00936a6bb9d35908640da9043b3f5a955014d478; aae7c875fc7531233c2a3ebefa31a33f1a0d7f49; 9098c74b172c86f0e61cc2b3879ccbdfbad9c5a8; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf,arXiv: Methodology,,

To identify effective stripe rust resistance loci, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted using 232 elite durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) lines from worldwide breeding programs. Genotyping with the 90Â K iSelect wheat single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array resulted in 11,635 markers distributed across the genome. Response to stripe rust infection at the seedling stage revealed resistant and susceptible accessions present in rather balanced frequencies for the six tested races, with a higher frequency of susceptible responses to United States races as compared to Italian races (61.1 vs. 43.1% of susceptible accessions). Resistance at the seedling stage only partially explained adult plant resistance, which was found to be more frequent with 67.7% of accessions resistant across six nurseries in the United States. GWAS identified 82 loci associated with seedling stripe rust resistance, five of which were significant at the false discovery rate adjusted P value <0.1 and 11 loci were detected for the field response at the adult plant stages in at least two environments. Notably, Yrdurum-1BS.1 showed the largest effect for both seedling and field resistance, and is therefore considered as a major locus for resistance in tetraploid wheat. Our GWAS study is the first of its kind for stripe rust resistance in tetraploid wheat and provides an overview of resistance in elite germplasm and reports new loci that can be used in breeding resistant cultivars.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Weizhen Liu"", ids = ""49663122""); list(name = ""Marco Maccaferri"", ids = ""87467934""); list(name = ""Peter Bulli"", ids = ""3534451""); list(name = ""Sheri Rynearson"", ids = ""8110033""); list(name = ""Roberto Tuberosa"", ids = ""4374097""); list(name = ""Xianming Chen"", ids = ""1767481""); list(name = ""Michael O.

3fa66786ea07c55f1544e1b24b4d704f2ee439af,P4-01-05: The Multikinase Inhibitor Sorafenib Can Overcome Antiestrogen Resistance in Patients with Progressive Metastatic Estrogen Receptor (ER) Positive Breast Cancer.,"Background Resistance to antiestrogens is a major problem in metastatic breast cancer. Preclinical data suggest that growth factor signaling and angiogenesis may promote endocrine resistance and blocking such pathways may delay resistance. Methods : We conducted a phase II clinical trial of adding sorafenib, a VEGFR and Ras/Raf/MAPK inhibitor, to antiestrogen therapy in patients with metastatic ER-positive breast cancer. Patients were required to have progressive disease on an anstiestrogen or have maximum response with residual measurable disease. A core biopsy of accessible breast disease was offered at entry and after 28 days of sorafenib. Microarray experiments were performed on frozen tissue obtained from 4 paired biopsies using Affymetrix Gene Chip HG-U133 Plus 2. Data was normalized based on the GCRMA method and Expression values of each gene were analyzed based on the significant analysis of microarray (SAM) method for paired data. Gene set analysis on KEGG pathways was performed using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method, where genes were ranked based on the absolute values of their SAM test statistics. Serum was collected on day 1 and day 28 for biomarker comparison using ELISA. Primary study endpoint was response rate by RECIST criteria after 3 months of sorafenib and secondary endpoints were safety, time to progression (TTP), and biomarker assessment. Results : Planned sample size was 43 but the study closed after 11 patients because of slow accrual. Median age was 45 years (Range 39â€“72). 7 patients were on tamoxifen, 3 on an aromatase inhibitor, and 1 on fulvestrant. Of the 11 patients enrolled, 8 had progressive disease (PD) on entry and 3 had confirmed stable disease (SD) on antiestrogen alone. One patient with SD at entry discontinued sorafenib after 2 weeks because of a grade 3 rash. Of the 10 patients evaluable for response, 7 had SD (70%) and 3 had PD. Median TTP after adding sorafenib was 182 days (6 months) and in the 8 patients who entered the study with PD, 5 converted to SD (62%) with a median TTP of 192 days (6.4 months). One patient remains on treatment after 16 months of enrollment. Most common adverse events were rash in 9 patients, weight loss in 8 and hypertension in 6. Hypophosphatemia was seen in 11 patients, hypokalemia in 9, and elevated ALT/AST in 4. The majority of toxicities were grade 1. There were 6 grade 3 toxicities; rash, anorexia, hypokalemia, colitis, and 2 hypophosphatemia. No grade 4 toxicities occurred. Microarray analysis identified 29 enriched pathways with a false discovery rate of less than 25%. There was a significant reduction in mean serum Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) and platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFR-Î±) on day 28 (P values= Conclusions : Sorafenib can overcome resistance to antiestrogens, particularly tamoxifen, and may help avoid the routine early use of chemotherapy for endocrine resistant disease. Further study of strategies to overcome endocrine resistance is warranted to help preserve patient quality of life and to investigate mechanisms of resistance.

The inflammatory response induced by coal smoke components may promote lung tumor development. We studied the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in innate immunity and lung cancer risk in a population-based case-control study (122 cases and 122 controls) in Xuanwei. A total of 1,360 tag SNPs in 149 gene regions were included in the analysis. FCER2 rs7249320 was the most significant SNP (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.16-0.55; P: 0.0001; false discovery rate value, 0.13) for variant carriers. The gene regions ALOX12B/ALOX15B and KLK2 were associated with increased lung cancer risk globally (false discovery rate value <0.15). In addition, there were positive interactions between KLK15 rs3745523 and smoky coal use (OR: 9.40; P-interaction = 0.07) and between FCER2 rs7249320 and KLK2 rs2739476 (OR: 10.77; P-interaction = 0.003).

The language of medical research appears to be intrinsically tied to the culture of medical research and provides a unique window into broader trends in the culture of medicine.


Objective
To analyze medical language from 5 premier medical journals and investigate broader changes in the culture of clinical investigation during the last 40 years.


Design, Setting, and Participants
In this qualitative study using a data-driven analysis, 302 293 PubMed records were extracted from JAMA, The Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine, the BMJ, and New England Journal of Medicine from January 1, 1976, through December 31, 2015, to identify key trends in medical language. A frequency analysis was applied across the 40-year time frame in JAMA to assess the major trends in all publication types. Patient-centered language was analyzed in clinical trials in the flanking time periods (1976-1980 and 2011-2015) across the 5 journals. Data were analyzed from November 16, 2016, through November 9, 2018.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Increasing or decreasing frequency of words (monograms) and word pairs (bigrams) and the proportion of patient-centric words in journal article titles.


Results
In JAMA, 50â€¯277 articles of all publication types were included. In the frequency analysis, the most increased terms were reflective of the language of epidemiological research. The bigram analysis revealed a decline in causal language (-2.42/100 000 words to -2.03/100â€¯000 words; false discovery rate [FDR], <0.01) and an increased description of patients in the plural form (6.92/100 000 words to 11.4/100â€¯000 words; FDR, <0.01). A trend to separate patient from disease was observed; for example, there was a decrease in describing a patient as a diabetic (-2.21/100â€¯000 words; FDR, <0.01) compared with a patient with diabetes. In the analysis of clinical trials in all 5 journals, 3125 titles were identified (range, 193-932 per journal). In 4 of the 5 journals, use of patient-centric keywords increased significantly (absolute increase, 18.9%-34.3%; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001 for 3 journals; Pâ€‰=â€‰.01 for 1 journal), with the New England Journal of Medicine as the exception. This finding reflects a change from shorter disease-centric titles to longer titles that describe patients with a disease.


Conclusions and Relevance
Trends in medical language reflect the rise of evidence-based medicine, a shift in focus from individuals to populations, and a separation of patient and disease. Data-driven analysis of medical language provides a unique window into the changing landscape of medical culture.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gregory M.

39edea0a7127177817f3df558e305cabdf95e9a4,Preliminary findings of cortical thickness abnormalities in blast injured service members and their relationship to clinical findings,"Though cortical abnormalities have been demonstrated in moderate and severe traumatic brain injured (TBI) patients, there have been no studies examining cortical changes following blast related mild TBI (mTBI). The purpose of this study was to determine the effects and functional relevance of blast mTBI on cortical thickness in a small cohort of carefully screened blast injured US Service Members (SM). Twelve SM with mTBI acquired through blast injury were compared to 11 demographically matched control SM without TBI. Both mTBI and control participants were active duty and had completed a combat deployment. Subjects underwent MRI examination and the T1 weighted anatomic images were processed using the FreeSurfer suite of tools. Cortical thickness maps were compared between groups and examined for relationships with time since injury (TSI). Utilizing a large database of functional imaging results (BrainMap), significant regions of interest (ROI) were used to determine the behavioral profiles most consistently associated with the specific ROI. In addition, clinical variables were examined as part of post-hoc analysis of functional relevance. Group comparisons controlling for age demonstrated several significant clusters of cortical thinning for the blast injured SM. After multiple comparisons correction (False Discovery Rate (FDR)), two left hemisphere clusters remained significant (left superior temporal (STG) and frontal (SFG) gyri). No clusters were significantly correlated with TSI after FDR correction. Behavioral analysis for the STG and SFG clusters demonstrated three significant behavioral/cognitive sub-domains, each associated with audition and language. Blast injured SMs demonstrated distinct areas of cortical thinning in the STG and SFG. These areas have been previously shown to be associated with audition and language. Post-hoc analyses of clinical records demonstrated significant abnormal audiology reports for the blast injured SM suggesting that the thinning in these ROIs might be related to injury to the external auditory system rather than direct injury to the brain from the blast. It is clear that additional replication is needed in much larger cohorts. Importantly, the combination of imaging tools and methods in this study successfully demonstrated the potential to define unique ROIs and functional correlates that can be used to design future studies.",2013,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""David F Tate"", ids = ""145409692""); list(name = ""Gerald E.

4ee5ffef04dc3eeebe4335ede4a65c069bc81486,Assessment of band-based similarity coefficients for automatic type and subtype classification of microbial isolates analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.,"Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has been the typing method of choice for strain identification in epidemiological studies of several bacterial species of medical importance. The usual procedure for the comparison of strains and assignment of strain type and subtype relies on visual assessment of band difference number, followed by an incremental assignment to the group hosting the most similar type previously seen. Band-based similarity coefficients, such as the Dice or the Jaccard coefficient, are then used for dendrogram construction, which provides a quantitative assessment of strain similarity. PFGE type assignment is based on the definition of a threshold linkage value, below which strains are assigned to the same group. This is typically performed empirically by inspecting the hierarchical cluster analysis dendrogram containing the strains of interest. This approach has the problem that the threshold value selected is dependent on the linkage method used for dendrogram construction. Furthermore, the use of a linkage method skews the original similarity values between strains. In this paper we assess the goodness of classification of several band-based similarity coefficients by comparing it with the band difference number for PFGE type and subtype classification using receiver operating characteristic curves. The procedure described was applied to a collection of PFGE results for 1,798 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which documented 96 types and 396 subtypes. The band-based similarity coefficients were found to perform equally well for type classification, but with different proportions of false-positive and false-negative classifications in their minimal false discovery rate when they were used for subtype classification.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""JoÃ£o AndrÃ© CarriÃ§o"", ids = ""4908451""); list(name = ""Francisco R Pinto"", ids = ""144133066""); list(name = ""Carla Simas"", ids = ""4422129""); list(name = ""SÃ´nia Maria Viana Nunes"", ids = ""3688641""); list(name = ""Natacha G Sousa"", ids = ""15703568""); list(name = ""Nelson FrazÃ£o"", ids = ""4888578""); list(name = ""H de Lencastre"", ids = ""11525775""); list(name = ""Jonas S.

8876529647cb774027104c82818be3a553a9ceac,Diminished default mode network recruitment of the hippocampus and parahippocampus in temporal lobe epilepsy.,"OBJECT
Functional neuroimaging has shown that the brain organizes into several independent networks of spontaneously coactivated regions during wakeful rest (resting state). Previous research has suggested that 1 such network, the default mode network (DMN), shows diminished recruitment of the hippocampus with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This work seeks to elucidate how hippocampal recruitment into the DMN varies by hemisphere of epileptogenic focus.


METHODS
The authors addressed this issue using functional MRI to assess resting-state DMN connectivity in 38 participants (23 control participants, 7 patients with TLE and left-sided epileptogenic foci, and 8 patients with TLE and right-sided foci). Independent component analysis was conducted to identify resting-state brain networks from control participants' data. The DMN was identified and deconstructed into its individual regions of interest (ROIs). The functional connectivity of these ROIs was analyzed both by hemisphere (left vs right) and by laterality to the epileptogenic focus (ipsilateral vs contralateral).


RESULTS
This attempt to replicate previously published methods with this data set showed that patients with left-sided TLE had reduced connectivity between the posterior cingulate (PCC) and both the left (p = 0.012) and right (p < 0.002) hippocampus, while patients with right-sided TLE showed reduced connectivity between the PCC and right hippocampus (p < 0.004). After recoding ROIs by laterality, significantly diminished functional connectivity was observed between the PCC and hippocampus of both hemispheres (ipsilateral hippocampus, p < 0.001; contralateral hippocampus, p = 0.017) in patients with TLE compared with control participants. Regression analyses showed the reduced DMN recruitment of the ipsilateral hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) to be independent of clinical variables including hippocampal sclerosis, seizure frequency, and duration of illness. The graph theory metric of strength (or mean absolute correlation) showed significantly reduced connectivity of the ipsilateral hippocampus and ipsilateral PHG in patients with TLE compared with controls (hippocampus: p = 0.028; PHG: p = 0.021, after correction for false discovery rate). Finally, these hemispheric asymmetries in strength were observed in patients with TLE that corresponded to hemisphere of epileptogenic focus; 87% of patients with TLE had weaker ipsilateral hippocampus strength (compared with the contralateral hippocampus), and 80% of patients had weaker ipsilateral PHG strength.


CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrated that recoding brain regions by the laterality to their epileptogenic focus increases the power of statistical approaches for finding interhemispheric differences in brain function. Using this approach, the authors showed TLE to selectively diminish connectivity of the hippocampus and parahippocampus in the hemisphere of the epileptogenic focus.

4c850f993f637e55275c902ae43cf6019592016a,Asymptotic results on adaptive false discovery rate controlling procedures based on kernel estimators,"The False Discovery Rate (FDR) is a commonly used type I error rate in multiple testing problems. It is defined as the expected False Discovery Proportion (FDP), that is, the expected fraction of false positives among rejected hypotheses. When the hypotheses are independent, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure achieves FDR control at any pre-specified level. By construction, FDR control offers no guarantee in terms of power, or type II error. A number of alternative procedures have been developed, including plug-in procedures that aim at gaining power by incorporating an estimate of the proportion of true null hypotheses. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of a class of plug-in procedures based on kernel estimators of the density of the $p$-values, as the number $m$ of tested hypotheses grows to infinity. In a setting where the hypotheses tested are independent, we prove that these procedures are asymptotically more powerful in two respects: (i) a tighter asymptotic FDR control for any target FDR level and (ii) a broader range of target levels yielding positive asymptotic power. We also show that this increased asymptotic power comes at the price of slower, non-parametric convergence rates for the FDP. These rates are of the form $m^{-k/(2k+1)}$, where $k$ is determined by the regularity of the density of the $p$-value distribution, or, equivalently, of the test statistics distribution. These results are applied to one- and two-sided tests statistics for Gaussian and Laplace location models, and for the Student model.",2013,Mathematics; Physics; Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Pierre Neuvial"", ids = ""2225429"")",854d7a2532fb59bebba38833f95825da42bfd17f; 0fe28636c4aac89d6aa6101a2eeb4c446d5893ef; 2e5258900ba2f9134dcd5bee4a1f88091a972234; 3c8da7d27ce822b608375e5a5dbcb28d99a71025; fd4de5e69b3942e3ff28ed06f1722b0e17d5fadf; 1900e254a8923892e0bdd6a0315bb845ceb6bc3e,d6e13df3fbb2002ab5af4859853a96fd0d800127; 234cff6937c43cb1c4d3510faeda6c8720737f9d; 6470ca07d9fe23f4f364a6584da954417644fb94; e393c289a9c4311e3eb28369e273d52a84a013c2; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; 379daa0dabeffa72b9a0d8c48b361236c03fb302; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; feab2d46657bbc969290d4df82c6669f9fbf3c6b; 67400dc68fe23f9533e40c6102c662f0211d2a7c; 81b701cffbe068270e50481a4c97a2d584c9ad52; 92013517811f387db2d75b6f81a524813c760218; 297729649e7cc13fb54880ac4cf49ef89dfd72a7; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6; 1c49766cd3d2e19089fea703e579a73011946ac7; e256758abee0d7b25afc0b7d426780406e2c7f6b; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 5c5becc796db9bb107d4908f40746d82ccae0fe4; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; 9c277ec5dfa4cfb137b627b81a61651d8948173c; c0775b1f5d1b7cced27dd2d9262cafad1f4bc4dd; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e,J.

b752daaadf7a5e73665a71df1e2201fec1e9cf71,SNP calling by sequencing pooled samples,"BackgroundPerforming high throughput sequencing on samples pooled from different individuals is a strategy to characterize genetic variability at a small fraction of the cost required for individual sequencing. In certain circumstances some variability estimators have even lower variance than those obtained with individual sequencing. SNP calling and estimating the frequency of the minor allele from pooled samples, though, is a subtle exercise for at least three reasons. First, sequencing errors may have a much larger relevance than in individual SNP calling: while their impact in individual sequencing can be reduced by setting a restriction on a minimum number of reads per allele, this would have a strong and undesired effect in pools because it is unlikely that alleles at low frequency in the pool will be read many times. Second, the prior allele frequency for heterozygous sites in individuals is usually 0.5 (assuming one is not analyzing sequences coming from, e.g. cancer tissues), but this is not true in pools: in fact, under the standard neutral model, singletons (i.e. alleles of minimum frequency) are the most common class of variants because P(f) âˆ 1/f and they occur more often as the sample size increases. Third, an allele appearing only once in the reads from a pool does not necessarily correspond to a singleton in the set of individuals making up the pool, and vice versa, there can be more than one read â€“ or, more likely, none â€“ from a true singleton.ResultsTo improve upon existing theory and software packages, we have developed a Bayesian approach for minor allele frequency (MAF) computation and SNP calling in pools (and implemented it in a program called snape): the approach takes into account sequencing errors and allows users to choose different priors. We also set up a pipeline which can simulate the coalescence process giving rise to the SNPs, the pooling procedure and the sequencing. We used it to compare the performance of snape to that of other packages.ConclusionsWe present a software which helps in calling SNPs in pooled samples: it has good power while retaining a low false discovery rate (FDR). The method also provides the posterior probability that a SNP is segregating and the full posterior distribution of f for every SNP. In order to test the behaviour of our software, we generated (through simulated coalescence) artificial genomes and computed the effect of a pooled sequencing protocol, followed by SNP calling. In this setting, snape has better power and False Discovery Rate (FDR) than the comparable packages samtools, PoPoolation, Varscan : for N = 50 chromosomes, snape has power â‰ˆ 35% and FDR â‰ˆ 2.5%. snape is available athttp://code.google.com/p/snape-pooled/ (source code and precompiled binaries).",2011,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Emanuele Raineri"", ids = ""49067128""); list(name = ""Luca Ferretti"", ids = ""8106445""); list(name = ""Anna Esteve-Codina"", ids = ""1404536121""); list(name = ""Bruno Nevado"", ids = ""48214988""); list(name = ""Simon Heath"", ids = ""145851618""); list(name = ""Miguel PÃ©rez-Enciso"", ids = ""1396536611"")",6537d07f27819572539fa0a7701aa15aa4526ec6; d01aec95bfdec0f1b3bbac704606451dc8e23da6; d2164f71c8e3cd7dd38df2bb6a9f3df2386af3b2; 92b097067ea482716220162be57daa7d1407636d; 5244596a5fb2108e802f651799a3d886df61563c; b521cd36e2afe39c1e925c47a3bdd4541f2d17ed; 76ea9a548cb3a42c8bd0581574e8c7445c4fcb0e; 1b65678e56eb5cca86c322fbdc169324970ef36a; d526e2003a3bc2d769e24fc6839700f7c22d794f; bf8caaf9890902cffb7178f6b2d830421cd00b51; b752daaadf7a5e73665a71df1e2201fec1e9cf71; 940d18d1062ba564d6ba026e54d5fefd430bdda5; 8f6a46649b4ff5d7f214c458e39b438482bb32ca; 6134866d7ae75f477c043d1a0f9f87528e181aef; 47197e58eba639290668d6f6a05f472d8191a363; c762495744fc6d2cc6e28f25a7f403461471f4cf; 025c543ff637592c3d4a01436a663913036e4c94; 5ea012ad3d0d7dfc73f8fcc863e664c912257014; 5812437b0504be9eae7112a1e46f3a2e4ab59d7b; 9aa171581d5c02d6b53c38e7c41f4cdc128ce78c; 54c4d293eb4222049c93a36a68ba5ce0535f1fea; f9bc16d84d8dcf067c37bf6515f3f5689c0e64bd; 6a462164e2c223933a40cbb3387883768b8ad272; bf9db634f8a8824a531d171d05e9342ed1cff70d; fead9823e19214ccd06046bfee68121eed5cec42; 8987ad0a55a3d7cedaa6b623cbc6386402270bcd; fd196c6392e58a0a2a680ddc8025fa2c4b25e397; 7db2259357c5a386620023f7e7ca176418c9adfa; 842f1007087b1dfd6c1fa55f42cd9fdd1e061f1c; c7359227131a57a580d8d44590c517cdb0404812; b0c18317d99fa91a541e647fcc11188d02ab4e26; c104db512a16d357d832c1f85bd01001dd75a9b8; abb76318e368b6bc57895f1969a9cd7037b5aac4; c47cc7fef866ab2925a4704162a19bc12606abf5,d4be2eb1830c42f88406cce8f489eadb687454bd; 41b8fd09b3c0c02c30085f1f45e9c0bd366200a2; 3cd3283d11432202fc228e4c2dfdf4d814d1b1d3; 27e4b0095156673cebcd19d3d9d7dcd51e5c9075; 2811f76635d6ef9fe540afaaef388f4284655f75; a90bccd42e05422949ffc01771b7ea474041183a; b4da5cc2676b86904a898490fc1c0a86906983d8; c654498e77b46862a5eca337fb486f5fc60a73ab; 2cfa8d059c0a5df68c181bd674d2a18aca51c846; f64ecdce41bc7fa557c8feca136a37a98309e73c; cdb91f039a0e7f5fde482d930f2acab358758691; 507ea84199e2f47e3e6e98133eb028749937fd3e; b6de563c03eedf95d7e880a2aeb5688936ea1d26; f0ed10be856d7fc635a34d3d057a10e878ab33cb; 06545e577342e9bdcc94a9c0977742630e4fc396; b752daaadf7a5e73665a71df1e2201fec1e9cf71,BMC Bioinformatics,13,239 - 239
da5a6f4bcc3d0a51ef73bc068f7f4254af8d5e19,Multiple Testing of Submatrices of a Precision Matrix with Applications to Identification of Between Pathway Interactions.,"Making accurate inference for gene regulatory networks, including inferring about pathway by pathway interactions, is an important and difficult task. Motivated by such genomic applications, we consider multiple testing for conditional dependence between subgroups of variables. Under a Gaussian graphical model framework, the problem is translated into simultaneous testing for a collection of submatrices of a high-dimensional precision matrix with each submatrix summarizing the dependence structure between two subgroups of variables. A novel multiple testing procedure is proposed and both theoretical and numerical properties of the procedure are investigated. Asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic for an individual hypothesis is established and the proposed multiple testing procedure is shown to asymptotically control the false discovery rate (FDR) and false discovery proportion (FDP) at the pre-specified level under regularity conditions. Simulations show that the procedure works well in controlling the FDR and has good power in detecting the true interactions.

6e90d73af3254cfb656bf915e1789d8349e39741,Protein abundance ratios for global studies of prokaryotes.,"The use of multidimensional capillary HPLC combined with MS/MS has allowed high qualitative and quantitative proteome coverage of prokaryotic organisms. The determination of protein abundance change between two or more conditions has matured to the point that false discovery rates can be very low and for smaller proteomes coverage is sufficiently high to explicitly consider false negative error. Selected aspects of using these methods for global protein abundance assessments are reviewed. These include instrumental issues that influence the reliability of abundance ratios; a comparison of sources of nonlinearity, errors, and data compression in proteomics and spotted cDNA arrays; strengths and weaknesses of spectral counting versus stable isotope metabolic labeling; and a survey of microbiological applications of global abundance analysis at the protein level. Proteomic results for two organisms that have been studied extensively using these methods are reviewed in greater detail. Spectral counting and metabolic labeling data are compared and the utility of proteomics for global gene regulation studies are discussed for the methanogenic Archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis. The oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis is discussed as an example of an organism where a large percentage of the proteome differs in relative abundance between the intracellular and extracellular phenotype.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Qiangwei Xia"", ids = ""35673589""); list(name = ""Erik L.

9693ef210e0de62447ae0982112ec38c69b558c5,Association of genetic variants with myocardial infarction in Japanese individuals with different lipid profiles.,"Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI). We previously showed that gene polymorphisms associated with MI differed among individuals with different lipid profiles. We further examined whether genetic variants that confer susceptibility to MI might differ among individuals with low or high serum concentrations of triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, or low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. The study population comprised 5270 Japanese individuals, including 1188 subjects with MI and 4082 controls. The 150 polymorphisms examined in the present study were selected by genome-wide association studies of MI and ischemic stroke with the use of the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set. The initial Chi-square test revealed that the A->G polymorphism (rs12632110) of SEMA3F was significantly (false discovery rate <0.05) associated with MI among individuals with high serum HDL-cholesterol or among those with low serum LDL-cholesterol. Subsequent multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates revealed that rs12632110 was significantly (P<0.01) associated with MI in individuals with high serum HDL-cholesterol or with low serum LDL-cholesterol. The genetic variants that confer susceptibility to MI differ among individuals with different lipid profiles, and the genetic component for the development of MI is more apparent in individuals at low-risk (high HDL- and low LDL-cholesterol levels) compared to those at high-risk. Stratification of subjects according to lipid profiles may thus be important for personalized prevention of MI based on genetic information.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Tetsuro Yoshida"", ids = ""9796442""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Kiyoshi Yokoi"", ids = ""2332668""); list(name = ""Mitsutoshi Oguri"", ids = ""5005355""); list(name = ""Sachiro Watanabe"", ids = ""66974556""); list(name = ""Norifumi Metoki"", ids = ""6157218""); list(name = ""Hidemi Yoshida"", ids = ""35118819""); list(name = ""Kei Satoh"", ids = ""49245021""); list(name = ""Yukitoshi Aoyagi"", ids = ""5446851""); list(name = ""Yoshinori Nozawa"", ids = ""3526189""); list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711"")",eda20fe48f0bd03b6c1687af4c7837b3671fbb19; 33200bc034cd2a2b7c33bced8d8a5476233e0dad; d401626b8887e7a12961fd2c44101366d7128402; 4b54b402f135d96caba9c04659765f629cc7400b; 6a9b4d5b58cfddd2afe470ea83e350fde9960edc,4b669b0394c7408b79ec0198822554cd5c6a9ae0; 3b0528b12ad9da2c5f4eef0050539a1c96950210; 4406a4ea9cc265888f75d36d942f0af6c28c8244; f306752069740c58dbef9cd2349421aa33c961db; e3f29f25ee82aaea8cb61ce360d57bfb03409a18; 4bf6308006f1aa53559504afd4d704082fbffeca; a6318caa665a7c6d60d9fd4ca3f344824820462b; 25d311acc42a879a557b4f8710006620f1d59ae8; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 5aaafa212640191412c214f54eb5e044599f05ba; 1572a03e619648ff016d6497ea25597a21484a5f; e63297b87e2120d8c2dbf530be4f01d2c1a8606e; 423df7d78cd7e556c7e7ef351a9081aa80496668; df9b906b5c2ca1122f2359dc39bd6c060b4d139a; 4888aaa6a7e1d415c9653802a3bf54199324e348; c6c5bbe025441bb878530bbd85db55cb110ef15a; 28a76c403c6ba6c57a9860ae0e78c0da54658053; babefe1234b18cc52c605dc6a0bd45c79ac00bfd; 6a617f74cd0dc618417093cb55a5809760e2670d; b665548b03eaba00f13fc3c895b5d0ecc5e3d5be; 73afd844605a54f8a9a63388eb02471279a8cb74; 26490d36ddf87e9eccf37f25bc943c61b1474beb,International journal of molecular medicine,25 4,"

db8be5eb0a05b84336b9428da30bd8c1d0c348b0,Effects of mRNA amplification on gene expression ratios in cDNA experiments estimated by analysis of variance,"BackgroundA limiting factor of cDNA microarray technology is the need for a substantial amount of RNA per labeling reaction. Thus, 20â€“200 micro-grams total RNA or 0.5â€“2 micro-grams poly (A) RNA is typically required for monitoring gene expression. In addition, gene expression profiles from large, heterogeneous cell populations provide complex patterns from which biological data for the target cells may be difficult to extract. In this study, we chose to investigate a widely used mRNA amplification protocol that allows gene expression studies to be performed on samples with limited starting material. We present a quantitative study of the variation and noise present in our data set obtained from experiments with either amplified or non-amplified material.ResultsUsing analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple hypothesis testing, we estimated the impact of amplification on the preservation of gene expression ratios. Both methods showed that the gene expression ratios were not completely preserved between amplified and non-amplified material. We also compared the expression ratios between the two cell lines for the amplified material with expression ratios between the two cell lines for the non-amplified material for each gene. With the aid of multiple t-testing with a false discovery rate of 5%, we found that 10% of the genes investigated showed significantly different expression ratios.ConclusionAlthough the ratios were not fully preserved, amplification may prove to be extremely useful with respect to characterizing low expressing genes.",2002,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Vigdis Nygaard"", ids = ""2076121""); list(name = ""Anders LÃ¸land"", ids = ""88727456""); list(name = ""Marit Holden"", ids = ""51325726""); list(name = ""Mette Langaas"", ids = ""2899111""); list(name = ""HÌŠavard Rue"", ids = ""3227746""); list(name = ""Fang Liu"", ids = ""1713096""); list(name = ""Ola Myklebost"", ids = ""3255614""); list(name = ""Ã\230ystein Fodstad"", ids = ""5299626""); list(name = ""Eivind Hovig"", ids = ""1925617""); list(name = ""Birgitte Smith-SÃ¸rensen"", ids = ""1400849915"")",a2572f61898137d7d9c0635b77235d52c2866a23; 25d0f63edd608fdf7c033f31d5868f7be4bceca6; 458555d2e2a9e830a970e6a4954eacb9f266f5e2; 84b62c1d9b1fafe8838ba9685441b6826478ca57; e3e2798c46391f97389e699b623c6773ba979d78; dda377115b51a64dc0db86d7b3f589f14f47c9c8; 7c00d3f1c010b42f20b9632b35edd72359cac220; 1670abbc444e34989c45110d807b24b506edb2f8; 726b22fc5dd4d5f20242aa9a9fa048114da4ac24; 95d370fcc579015ed9435af2312dfdeb9fdb5026; ede08bd51eff65b20fdd6ad8af4d1688e958e0d5; 33fa2bd9d974c8ac6e392db3d40c3665a3ab6670; 13a4b0a6d92f8edde800225ddcb682ee9db3940f; 3692f0b5eaafd6882184d1ad246c99035c714441; 4d192be6a36be6c289dac3f96d36636d0dc7165f; 7ad866450a82e0de154b7ef63bde5b6a1dcd82c5; 4ce2b47839e658fe2079e07f0e3b399c81ca79e0; 819d5dcca608d214f8513cd3440cac62e666efb8; f0505e9721ddbc747384cc70491678ff5516084e; 76287a2bb32b5b91412eb05aff10347769f1aafa; 2e53d015a5f8b5454bbee9049a275adbdddf444f; bc1532c3663bbe83d9695bb0a0710de6252a9773; ee42a5a194ad44581026fc2c324425f3094020fc; ff2c03d0e5b740d737bb5638b51565f7e3db6c09; 7163d030712ae838758827f85d43ae1365b3fcac; 11490f1ef030345e7b1240f5e0cea0f72d63f983; f9d08673ddabb0de65d548e813360685d6ca47de; d674c6df004a3462f80511e74213c5453087578b; 1c3e752f2a6321b265d3ff8fa3879bf95556a44f; 367b2d457b529e50be25470ef34bd484c38fb76b; 0ec5dec20bd7fa6fcc59eef1d60fdd86a6b5decb; 3309e80d69a61b282020404ca8be7724c1b09d9d; b9b07c4f86573b842fd8ce88e54ad0d3f1c2bc20; b5c3744d6a303b871ddf38c0df779075174905df; 7e7c6fe65b10c70ff9cb43fc0e100a6fe3f31ca7; cab75a68bac9479b62926307d92c7c9508e46669; 62e7128e28ad756a46c5f56448165891144106c3; c84d8ae6b56a9e989d5162e6dcf198c340300d7d; db4c61a25cf149d8957350396b8a0ba99180b53a; 395cf0392550a4d11fe0cf148c5b5c8cc7487778; 687ed1024bd5bb16606919ffed538407dbbffd45; d6479929aafb5c527c2f6d483b7daaaa445c7a8a,310d10f1afba93d2ae5e1eca866506b78f384f2e; b70d6211b5bd92ee7e57d22b8dc84d598e6fe46c; ae3434f973111aff560cd61920514a6e6ac3e6ca; b4956a78493f3725578d06a917e494624fe3bf14; e440be6391c26f14363c8203f2256e96a63a4fbf; 430236a3d1b7aa9f67aa2107833308d7d5528698; 65c4f601132902530ff0217b21e321e9c7e7812a; 4323a1db27efc560677bb00b13809e7b0119b1c9; a6f5a5fe0d2d1e3f2a1bbfc40c63cb579f30346d; 769f53dd4e4b80f573202346233ea347e605c858; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 6e55cb731d112a2761bc8a0de509aaf2baf27d55; 3b97df43eeaa39c6aeee0bb4748f7ed3ada169dd; f8651c4cfafced6aaf1d3fa9e53c237c649e0fe7; d8cecf1fc7987f8304c14c5f4ae73b866f8ca75b; ccea618f9a2851e33398de395c4fc27d2ef982aa; 386712a12541e1d8a29303133fc79a3f79df8d13; e5409b0f74ec841ee36c6d3597b46258dbec5a37; 351476b0a489dd58a953973c5a924fed0646072d; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; 813ad0288dea08a7d66c1bcc0149e783a6773d32; 19f0f9bb6118dad6255364625d0755eef743835c; 3bdceda9fc7eb3faffc2ac4cf366aa4cbf744ed6; 2c9ea0c1487a355694264689b304a700015cd55e; efd913a16aaa6e3e7a1fe4487824151d17d2110e; d4b386986c0fc8270e065c93f518b292f7fbd69b,BMC Genomics,4,11 - 11
201335b9ed127f1dd1a7ff18cb9ab46ff64a03b8,Exhaustively Identifying Cross-Linked Peptides with a Linear Computational Complexity,"Chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry is a powerful tool to study protein-protein interactions and protein conformations. Two linked peptides are ionized and fragmented to produce a tandem mass spectrum. In such an experiment, a tandem mass spectrum contains ions from two peptides. The peptide identification problem becomes a peptide-peptide pair identification problem. Currently, most existing tools donâ€™t search all possible pairs due to the quadratic time complexity. Consequently, a significant percentage of linked peptides are missed. In our earlier work, we developed a tool named ECL to search all pairs of peptides exhaustively. While ECL does not miss any linked peptides, it is very slow due to the quadratic computational complexity, especially when the database is large. Furthermore, ECL uses a score function without statistical calibration, while researchers1,2 have demonstrated that using a statistical calibrated score function can achieve a higher sensitivity than using an uncalibrated one. Here, we propose an advanced version of ECL, named ECL 2.0. It achieves a linear time and space complexity by taking advantage of the additive property of a score function. It can analyze a typical data set containing tens of thousands of spectra using a large-scale database containing thousands of proteins in a few hours. Comparison with other five state-of-the-art tools shows that ECL 2.0 is much faster than pLink, StavroX, ProteinProspector, and ECL. Kojak is the only one tool that is faster than ECL 2.0. But Kojak does not exhaustively search all possible peptide pairs. We also adopt an e-value estimation method to calibrate the original score. Comparison shows that ECL 2.0 has the highest sensitivity among the state-of-the-art tools. The experiment using a large-scale in vivo cross-linking data set demonstrates that ECL 2.0 is the only tool that can find PSMs passing the false discovery rate threshold. The result illustrates that exhaustive search and well calibrated score function are useful to find PSMs from a huge search space.",2016,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Fengchao Yu"", ids = ""2898242""); list(name = ""Ning Li"", ids = ""145367351""); list(name = ""Weichuan Yu"", ids = ""38549423"")",,cbef3c33739f207c010a88ddb7e7c69333b0d9e8; 611c2c20f6566946694d832e58bfd7b7cb58b66e; 0f5751f76cef4a502b22ad088c381a4d0bb10121; 47f664efe54f7d4c76ad9542b90f2476c0d0b2b6; 05cd6287f4f48ecab4609a7ee447f04b1ac05ab3; 69dd19a43c9112d8365f6e8c90a6eeee0eafa349; 2c03084390ab3e102d501c3d7fae01c2c2e71f63; 192aa8f561360c1078981cc8cec4cb809b940515; 1b03414ebace3aae831362dc3ab07619e1ecb36f; a7a581f7f052570fa099dcb887b9934617760791; 85bf572c5faec8e8ff422892130b996c2b0a1c7b; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; a3df6588a84ee06fe1c9653040e44eede03edc32; 8270409069017c9597fa5a4a2315f108ae93cfca; b522bc9094ba1341ce6df358a09d77e37ab8464e; 0d7ba2f3111674bc3957d51188768b76387a2f1a; 0d7ee3f200a044b594606c9067bbcd1638ec32e3; 5c49743f50ab4a4577cd098f56bcb9dd443fc24d; cdacb9d12b93a0c55e9ced5524b72ec719a71082; 9f8e9fc4fadf4123ffa470db0cf0790437103567; 8233bfb3051ea6e9547af157f4d4995657da115c; 452f510d80653be529ffcd2408f2a31df8cb85a0; 4f94d90e2558511101f3470052547a1a9662c468; e45a8d7176bd738c1e63de1f6791a88e704f8b4b; e413557d7171ee61fc8ffea4630c2923964bbda3; 75e069eff49c89cd73365fd5acbcbe3cce28fae8; 7d48dcefb51e49116326bb99a0c4d59dc0e58997; 26b2280e6b18007685d30158d8b85582d06f1626; 36522079e6a659a5ef0d831a873fc6e374028c5d; 2a62b04461f9e01fb2d159e678659cd06a89a267; 1458943019d76ed6019d7d4bd91da262a0b29f0b; 2f110fbf461a5b5d8984fbae7f6d00daa7fe0413; 9f654a6194bd73767f19fc694e8e913b1ad5fbd8; 72ea65e7b53e3566a655cbeba45044dd526cbe20; 16e8e4fcd91e87834205f6f550e3f45c14b11390; 480f791f6d6b6f51e844ce2a59c3a67511e30e54; 1abf08cdd76a91e8ad3bc1bb8de65dc3030c8a6a; ca278a4cd769721bb148f9fcc9d6e34446b090e4; efa33db3f186c7801f738c6dd251f19a51415e87; b173d710be4defffe374093def0b4657bd6d7b20; 1936b1a962a72f99d29d01ab1d6c650aac1519d9; 22ebba6fb27fa6978bcda41193d48e1205193f16; a5a24e4aa0434727ed33774b999e575db08a2a81; 3dec9156722f58775a7de0781f333c37f62a6dd1; 427f417dba8d6b16ea372e28f129fc517f769fb4; 0feacf3c462968fcdb4c675d077443330aba826c; 6fbcc7c0260a409dea7f118395c11a8d0ac51297; f09d4a533a221b9b85c591ba1dc862dd2fe808a1; a4935c4283eaced5c52c3dda98e7e3c4590b4de2; 3971def8c66fb75e7c858cce8e2e48bda8d3f410; d84b42584aa17f31ce1281af81a56b59249df180; e0e48c3754dd1850561b2ba598d5a75259baa357,bioRxiv,,

As an alternative to Single Marker Analysis (SMA), all or subsets of markers can be tested simultaneously. This approach requires a form of Penalized Regression (PR) as the number of SNPs is much larger than the sample size. Here we review PR methods in the context of GWAS, extend them to perform penalty parameter and SNP selection by False Discovery Rate (FDR) control, and assess their performance (including penalties incorporating linkage disequilibrium) in comparison with SMA. PR methods were compared with SMA on realistically simulated GWAS data consisting of genotype data from single and multiple chromosomes and a continuous phenotype and on real data. Based on our comparisons our analytic FDR criterion may currently be the best approach to SNP selection using PR for GWAS. We found that PR with FDR control provides substantially more power than SMA with genome-wide type-I error control but somewhat less power than SMA with BenjaminiHochberg FDR control. PR controlled the FDR conservatively while SMA-BH may not achieve FDR control in all situations. Differences among PR methods seem quite small when the focus is on variable selection with FDR control. Incorporating LD into PR by adapting penalties developed for covariates measured on graphs can improve power but also generate morel false positives or wider regions for follow-up. We recommend using the Elastic Net with a mixing weight for the Lasso penalty near 0.5 as the best method.",2014,,"list(name = ""Hui Yi"", ids = ""49511751"")",,267d0e4cfbecf7206ceeb768af8dd54bbe57c15c; c3620866f75cf4d2cd498abc91b598ae1ddd1300; c61bf7414278ad46459990f68100375ae4639bdb; d68bb77f29ce1b19e13166f16c81e3841f03d8db; 68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; 5bb4c0f83877dc2485ab99120bd4a94780a8a17b; e9b0af9cbfcbc0f0ac59743e441eb4c3d49f45d5; 2eced4351be4bf8fa4177d5196bba4c8f0fa916a; d440eeaf5a78af05fee03adc77c802332e44a615; 0bfd57b42c4620d3f51d0c75a3919eb9c7b73e83; 7953ea921cbd3c62cac3004dafcd630e31eae81d; 44d934d1b52b1e6d0cb2f6725157078a631b3efb; 50b6a37dea80346593c2539245da25291c3678b0; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 1dbfa2053ddb473fcb1558eb2f0358381f277a28; ff597598040c8ce9e27327274f74510b413ed595; 1e94dbacf2fedaeaab614dfad3b1b40ebb7f4537; 0cb64a5dc4b4ebca3a3e1d3d50c4ae74ce7c5af2; ac0cd0ba89d33a3c05e81624c686f9b425c70b86; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; 2b1e7ef69cf6319cf98be8bdd401f52413b736f8; d28633983821aa3d886fd6379c52ea78dca51f28; e367c25f33176c8dd5737d55b58454c7df248836; cf6da91d65cf8f01c4708fd95044e55fa495478c; d9b5e89b643aa852b5d9ecdaeef43d7b5bc13824; 000551662c3902ed66709be879053d95dafc0211; eeca494ed4f29143b8c342fe4b939e6a77936d42; eb5e8213a462581cb43286f5c5307fa5398576ea; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6,,,

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develop autoantibodies against a spectrum of antigens, but the clinical significance of these autoantibodies is unclear. Using a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach, we examined the association between autoantibodies and clinical subphenotypes of RA.


METHODS
This study was conducted in a cohort of RA patients identified from the electronic medical records (EMRs) of 2 tertiary care centers. Using a published multiplex bead assay, we measured 36 autoantibodies targeting epitopes implicated in RA. We extracted all International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for each subject and grouped them into disease categories (PheWAS codes), using a published method. We tested for the association of each autoantibody (grouped by the targeted protein) with PheWAS codes. To determine significant associations (at a false discovery rate [FDR] of â‰¤0.1), we reviewed the medical records of 50 patients with each PheWAS code to determine positive predictive values (PPVs).


RESULTS
We studied 1,006 RA patients; the meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SD age of the patients was 61.0â€‰Â±â€‰12.9 years, and 79.0% were female. A total of 3,568 unique ICD-9 codes were grouped into 625 PheWAS codes; the 206 PheWAS codes with a prevalence of â‰¥3% were studied. Using the PheWAS method, we identified 24 significant associations of autoantibodies to epitopes at an FDR of â‰¤0.1. The associations that were strongest and had the highest PPV for the PheWAS code were autoantibodies against fibronectin and obesity (Pâ€‰=â€‰6.1 Ã— 10-4 , PPV 100%), and that between fibrinogen and pneumonopathy (Pâ€‰=â€‰2.7 Ã— 10-4 , PPV 96%). Pneumonopathy codes included diagnoses for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia and obliterative bronchiolitis.


CONCLUSION
We demonstrated application of a bioinformatics method, the PheWAS, to screen for the clinical significance of RA-related autoantibodies. Using the PheWAS approach, we identified potentially significant links between variations in the levels of autoantibodies and comorbidities of interest in RA.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Katherine P.

When a large proportion of the null hypotheses are false, as in the case of widespread effects such as cortical thinning throughout much of the brain, adaptive FDR methods can surprisingly reject more null hypotheses than not accounting for multiple testing at all-i.e., using uncorrected p-values. A straightforward mathematical argument is presented to explain why this can occur with the q-value method of Storey and colleagues, and a simulation study shows that it can also occur, to a lesser extent, with a two-stage FDR procedure due to Benjamini and colleagues. We demonstrate the phenomenon with reference to a published data set documenting cortical thinning in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

We wish to do so while offering finite-sample guarantees about the fraction of false positivesâ€”selected variables Xj that in fact have no effect on Y after the other features are known. When the number of features p is large (perhaps even larger than the sample size n), and we have no prior knowledge regarding the type of dependence between Y and X , the model-X knockoffs framework nonetheless allows us to select a model with a guaranteed bound on the false discovery rate, as long as the distribution of the feature vector X = (X1, . . . , Xp) is exactly known. This model selection procedure operates by constructing â€œknockoff copiesâ€ of each of the p features, which are then used as a control group to ensure that the model selection algorithm is not choosing too many irrelevant features. In this work, we study the practical setting where the distribution of X could only be estimated, rather than known exactly, and the knockoff copies of the Xj â€™s are therefore constructed somewhat incorrectly. Our results, which are free of any modeling assumption whatsoever, show that the resulting model selection procedure incurs an inflation of the false discovery rate that is proportional to our errors in estimating the distribution of each feature Xj conditional on the remaining features {Xk : k 6= j}.

BN Chr2 may contain genes that reduce vascular inflammation. The aim was to identify BN Chr2 genes that are anti-inflammatory under NSD and high-salt diet (HSD). Methods: Four-to-6 week-old male SS rats and congenic SB2a and SB2b rats containing different portions of BN Chr2 were fed a NSD or HSD (4% NaCl) for 8 weeks or until they developed a stroke as manifested by seizures. Systolic BP (SBP) was measured by telemetry. RNA was extracted from aorta and used for small and total RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq-2500. Sequences were mapped by STAR to Rattus norvegicus release-86 genome, annotated and counted by miRDeep2 for miRNA and HTSeq-count for mRNA and long non-coding RNA, and differential expression analysis done in R. Results: SBP was lower in SB2a and SB2b compared to SS (125â€ŠÂ±â€Š3, 127â€ŠÂ±â€Š6 vs 146â€ŠÂ±â€Š2â€Šmm Hg, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.05) under NSD. SBP tended to be higher in SB2b but not in SB2a when compared to SS (185â€ŠÂ±â€Š8, 167â€ŠÂ±â€Š7 vs 168â€ŠÂ±â€Š5â€Šmm Hg) under HSD. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) encoded in BN Chr2 introgressed portions were identified with fold change â‰¥1.5 and False discovery rateâ€Š<â€Š0.05. Ddah1 was commonly down-regulated in SB2a vs SS rats fed NSD and HSD while Acad9, Agtr1b, AABR07012047.1, Fbxw7, Ptgfrn were commonly down-regulated and AABR07012585.3, Bbs12, Kcnab1 up-regulated in SB2b vs SS rats fed NSD and HSD. Conclusion: BN Chr2 encoded DEGs were identified in aorta of congenic SB2a and SB2b rats fed NSD and HSD.

000140b16443a66107b854612857a4d10f3bafc7,Identification of genes regulated by interleukin-1beta in human endometrial stromal cells.,"Interleukin-1beta (IL-1b) is an important immune regulatory factor that in human endometrium plays a role in both menstruation and implantation in the event of pregnancy. It promotes inflammatory-like processes and also stimulates tissue remodelling. We present a cDNA microarray study documenting the major effects of IL-1beta on gene expression in stromal cells from human endometrium. Endometrial stromal cells from five normal healthy women at the mid secretory phase were cultured with or without IL-1beta at 50 and 500 pg/ml for 48 h. cDNA microarrays were used to compare the levels of gene expression in total RNA isolated from cells stimulated with IL-1beta. These cDNA arrays were produced containing 15 164 sequence-verified clones, which included genes known to be important in angiogenesis, immune modulators, apoptosis, cell signalling, extra-cellular matrix (ECM) remodelling and cell cycle regulation. Genes which were regulated by IL-1beta were identified by analysis of the microarray data using the Significance Analysis of Microarrays software package. Upregulated (n = 23) and downregulated (n = 6) different genes were observed, which changed at least 3-fold, at a false discovery rate of less than 2% (P < 0.02). Our results have identified genes regulated by IL-1beta, which are involved in leukocyte recruitment, ECM remodelling and other cellular functions. Changes in three genes, IL-8, colony-stimulating factor 2 and aldoketo reductase family 1 member 1, which were upregulated by IL-1beta, were verified using real-time PCR. Novel functions regulated by IL-1beta in endometrium, including genes involved in free radical protection, and fatty acid metabolism were also identified. These results also provide new insights into the role of IL-1beta in disorders of the endometrium, especially in implantation-related infertility and endometriosis, in which this cytokine plays a major role.",2005,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Marco Rossi"", ids = ""145801552""); list(name = ""Andrew M Sharkey"", ids = ""8896444""); list(name = ""Paola Vigano'"", ids = ""144612508""); list(name = ""Giovina Fiore"", ids = ""38356434""); list(name = ""Rob Furlong"", ids = ""144969201""); list(name = ""P.

1a33287c7579f7db5856a4cd77e1c8e4f10a1c56,Epigenome-wide association study for 28-day survival of acute respiratory distress syndrome,"Dear Editor, Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung disease with a mortality rate of over 40% among moderate-to-severe patients. A recent study demonstrated an association of microRNA (miRNA), an epigenetic regulator, with ARDS mortality [1]. Another epigenetic biomarker, DNA methylation, is associated with several inflammatory and pulmonary diseases [2]. DNA methylation, as a reversible epigenetic modification, offers potential diagnostic/prognostic and therapeutic value [2]. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) between DNA methylation and 28-day survival time in 185 moderate-to-severe ARDS patients from intensive care units (ICUs) (Table 1). DNA was extracted from whole blood, and methylation levels were measured on over 480,000 CpG sites. Associations between methylation and survival were evaluated by Cox models in two phases (discovery and validation) with adjustment for age, gender, APACHE III score, and cell-type heterogeneity. Results were described as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) per 0.01-unit increment of methylation beta values. Multiple testing corrections were performed using false discovery rate (FDR). Details are provided in the Supplementary Methods. We identified four CpG sites that were significantly associated with ARDS survival in both discovery and validation phases (FDR < 0.05) (Supplementary Table 1). Two sites are related to inflammation and infection, which are common manifestations in ARDS. Site cg08504659 (discovery phase: HR = 1.34, P = 7.53 Ã— 10âˆ’6; validation phase: HR = 1.22, P = 1.58 Ã— 10âˆ’4) is located within PTGDR (encoding prostaglandin D2 receptor), which is a mediator of allergic inflammation and is recognized as a drug target of asthma [3]. Another site, cg04740513 (discovery phase: HR = 0.97, P = 1.23 Ã— 10âˆ’5; validation phase: HR = 0.98, P = 1.06 Ã— 10âˆ’4), is located within ATP11A (encoding integral membrane ATPase), which is associated with pulmonary disorders related to inflammation and fibrosis [4] and was recently identified as a novel element of the innate immune response and inflammatory response [5]. By integrating all four statistically significant methylation sites, we built a methylation risk score for each patient (Supplementary Methods). Patients with a higher methylation risk score had a significantly higher hazard of death within 28 days (HR = 1.72 per 1-unit increment, P = 2.73 Ã— 10âˆ’7); the mortality HR was comparable to that of APACHE III score (HR = 1.71 per 40-unit increment, P = 5.00 Ã— 10âˆ’4) (Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for prediction of 28-day ARDS mortality was comparable between methylation risk score (0.68) and APACHE III score (0.67) (Supplementary Fig. 1).",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yichen Guo"", ids = ""6062007""); list(name = ""Ruyang Zhang"", ids = ""7265522""); list(name = ""Zhaozhong Zhu"", ids = ""5287292""); list(name = ""Sipeng Shen"", ids = ""10997919""); list(name = ""Li Su"", ids = ""145235478""); list(name = ""David C.

AMD3100, a selective antagonist of CXCR4, rapidly mobilizes hematopoietic progenitor cells into the circulation, has a synergistic effect on CD34+ cell mobilization when combined with G-CSF, and is currently being evaluated as a single agent to mobilize allografts. Apheresis collections mobilized with a single injection of AMD3100 contain a similar number of T-cells as those collected following 5 daily doses of G-CSF. We investigated whether T-cells mobilized with AMD3100 undergo changes in cytokine polarization status as described to occur with G-CSF mobilization. Using real time PCR, we investigated the expression of 84 genes associated with TH1, TH2, and TH3 T-cell pathways at baseline and following mobilization with a single injection of AMD3100 (dosed at 240 or 320 mcg/kg; n=12 subjects) or following 5 daily doses of G-CSF(n=5 subjects). RNA was extracted from CD3+ T-cells isolated using immunomagnetic beads (>95% purity) from PBMCs collected immediately before mobilization and 6 hours after AMD3100 administration or 5 days after G-CSF mobilization. The RT2 Profiler â„¢ PCR Array was used which contains pathway specific cytokine genes associated with TH1, TH2, and TH3 cells. Expression levels of 16 genes changed significantly (false discovery rate=0.10) from baseline following G-CSF mobilization; 9 genes were up-regulated and 7 genes were down-regulated from baseline. Five up-regulated and 4 down-regulated genes had greater than a 2-fold change in expression (Figure). In contrast, none of the 84 genes examined, including the 16 altered with G-CSF, changed significantly following AMD3100 administration. Our results are concordant with current literature that shows the expression of several genes effecting T-cell cytokine polarization are altered in G-CSF mobilized T-cells. It has been suggested that the TH2 polarization in G-CSF mobilized products contributes to the comparable incidence of acute GVHD and the higher incidence of chronic GVHD compared to bone marrow allografts. In contrast, T-cells mobilized with AMD3100 appear similar to non-mobilized T-cells, and do not undergo a change in TH1- and TH2-related gene expression. Whether the differences in cytokine polarization of T-lymphocytes mobilized with AMD3100 compared to G-CSF will impact immune reconstitution or other immune sequela (i.e. GVHD, graft-vs.-tumor) associated with HCT is currently being assessed in a pilot allogeneic transplantation trial in humans using AMD3100 to mobilize donors.",2007,Medicine,"list(name = ""Aleah L.

In this paper, we provide an improved method of constructing the test and null statistics which only requires 2 arrays under one condition if the number of arrays under the other condition is at least 3. The conventional testing method defines the rejection region by controlling the probability of Type I error. In this paper, we propose to determine the critical values (or the cut-off points) of the rejection region by directly controlling the false discovery rate. Simulations were carried out to compare the performance of our proposed method with several existing methods. Finally, our proposed method is applied to the rat data of Pan et al. (2003). It is seen from both simulations and the rat data that our method has lower false discovery rates than those from the significance analysis of microarray (SAM) method of Tusher et al. (2001) and the mixture model method (MMM) of Pan et al. (2003).",2006,Mathematics; Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Shunpu Zhang"", ids = ""33687207"")",ba305d28ab5570a7022982b3e80b7985d8279753; 67a4f670883d8c682b433418203fee4afc7a97ec; d79e1ecc3b689c443568d30ee439291740572785; 4676d3e962ef2cca57693e27570c86684c9c7843; 45b98abcedee993059e9cc87e5a4120ce859576c; 758b7d38db3a12cf1e00c399bd4ad88926d1007e; 91e488385853ca61894f342e35d4b4b65ed93bd0; f4b3f57bfd28028dd2c02d0717da39727e563ab4; 4dfc7249fc29d612476cc396cea9839a550f5efb; 278a5314461a71ecd0aa93ae01a653a487944bcb; 9725b023dd062ff6412e52f30511f12af170e26a; 7e0f38c8c5a64eb3f356c1743d637f4230e0ae05; 78d7c7bf918ade8b4ecc4455e437d16144cb07ed; c0ef59ffcfb43afe37977b4b8ffea2eb6329269b; 3f2627e0d856e3acfe1a67461119c7a36c19ee13,65c4f601132902530ff0217b21e321e9c7e7812a; a7d731ccc3a83e9567734265ddd41bb377286c17; 686abad29d835044cf97434c3c0fb9f80321c856; 7be801da3bb1274cd75faeef551a30473144c4be; a380e424e71ee719ef326d38f2baee2f32752d23; 427c5c5ab35ba8d7015e20469aee48370ee40215; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 4f2b48d49c81233aba44396af5b9848f04ed283d; 4d65e9ceb2981fc081f42544b5110ccd07d28976; ea0190e9062c66e170a26a2861323010b1e65ec3; e205a9cf860a45b34941cc0c0e0ac953134606a8; 9393721879cae0d9becd88aa9392800ec71dd005; 1746ef5dd71d1c7e3b41fb59d06f7970d19a16d6; d65ab6603658382103f1883c30fc0dea849667fb; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 460bc5461711b9dec056438a9197c4565bcc8cfb; 869e99037469fa9caa7b62e913b689812e6767e5,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology,5,
2ce75dfb91d70dc90280213c766a0f5e769a612f,An extensive survey of tyrosine phosphorylation revealing new sites in human mammary epithelial cells.,"Protein tyrosine phosphorylation represents a central regulatory mechanism in cell signaling. Here, we present an extensive survey of tyrosine phosphorylation sites in a normal-derived human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) line by applying antiphosphotyrosine peptide immunoaffinity purification coupled with high sensitivity capillary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 481 tyrosine phosphorylation sites (covered by 716 unique peptides) from 285 proteins were confidently identified in HMEC following the analysis of both the basal condition and acute stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF). The estimated false discovery rate was 1.0% as determined by searching against a scrambled database. Comparison of these data with existing literature showed significant agreement for previously reported sites. However, we observed 281 sites that were not previously reported for HMEC cultures and 29 of which have not been reported for any human cell or tissue system. The analysis showed that a majority of highly phosphorylated proteins were relatively low-abundance. Large differences in phosphorylation stoichiometry for sites within the same protein were also observed, raising the possibility of more important functional roles for such highly phosphorylated pTyr sites. By mapping to major signaling networks, such as the EGF receptor and insulin growth factor-1 receptor signaling pathways, many known proteins involved in these pathways were revealed to be tyrosine phosphorylated, which provides interesting targets for future hypothesis-driven and targeted quantitative studies involving tyrosine phosphorylation in HMEC or other human systems.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Tyler H.

6a9a16ac47b4292b9cb0ca2522387ef7f4c51c55,"IFNâ€stimulated Gene Expression, Type 2 Inflammation, and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Asthma","Rationale: Quantification of type 2 inflammation provided a molecular basis for heterogeneity in asthma. Nonâ€type 2 pathways that contribute to asthma pathogenesis are not well understood. Objectives: To identify dysregulated pathways beyond type 2 inflammation. Methods: We applied RNA sequencing to airway epithelial brushings obtained from subjects with stable mild asthma not on corticosteroids (n = 19) and healthy control subjects (n = 16). Sequencing reads were mapped to human and viral genomes. In the same cohort, and in a separate group with severe asthma (n = 301), we profiled blood gene expression with microarrays. Measurements and Main Results: In airway brushings from mild asthma on inhaled corticosteroids, RNA sequencing yielded 1,379 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate < 0.01). Pathway analysis revealed increased expression of type 2 markers, IFNâ€stimulated genes (ISGs), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressâ€related genes. Airway epithelial ISG expression was not associated with type 2 inflammation in asthma or with viral transcripts but was associated with reduced lung function by FEV1 (&rgr; = â€0.72; P = 0.0004). ER stress was confirmed by an increase in XBP1 (Xâ€box binding protein 1) splicing in mild asthma and was associated with both type 2 inflammation and ISG expression. ISGs were also the most activated genes in blood cells in asthma and were correlated with airway ISG expression (&rgr; = 0.55; P = 0.030). High blood ISG expression in severe asthma was similarly unrelated to type 2 inflammation. Conclusions: ISG activation is prominent in asthma, independent of viral transcripts, orthogonal to type 2 inflammation, and associated with distinct clinical features. ER stress is associated with both type 2 inflammation and ISG expression.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Nirav R Bhakta"", ids = ""5157369""); list(name = ""Stephanie A Christenson"", ids = ""5053395""); list(name = ""Srilaxmi Nerella"", ids = ""1761504""); list(name = ""Owen D.

536c6b5600aafe59afe982199b7c455579ca93fb,Functional disconnectivity of the medial temporal lobe in Aspergerâ€™s syndrome,"BACKGROUND
Autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions that may be caused by abnormal connectivity between brain regions constituting neurocognitive networks for specific aspects of social cognition.


METHODS
We used three-way multidimensional scaling of regionally parcellated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to explore the hypothesis of abnormal functional connectivity in people with ASD. Thirteen high-functioning individuals with Asperger's syndrome and 13 healthy volunteers were scanned during incidental processing of fearful facial expressions.


RESULTS
Using permutation tests for inference, we found evidence for significant abnormality of functional integration of amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus (p < .05, false discovery rate [FDR] corrected) in people with Asperger's syndrome. There were less salient abnormalities in functional connectivity of anterior cingulate, inferior occipital, and inferior frontal cortex, but there was no significant difference between groups in whole brain functional connectivity.


CONCLUSIONS
We conclude there is evidence that functional connectivity of medial temporal lobe structures specifically is abnormal in people with Asperger's syndrome during fearful face processing.",2005,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""David Welchew"", ids = ""4153092""); list(name = ""Chris Ashwin"", ids = ""145542036""); list(name = ""Karim Berkouk"", ids = ""48249894""); list(name = ""Raymond Salvador"", ids = ""143662276""); list(name = ""Ed T.

45476ed0bc4a9f9381ec908f7da4fe89aac8617d,Pregnancy-Induced Changes in Systemic Gene Expression among Healthy Women and Women with Rheumatoid Arthritis,"BACKGROUND
Pregnancy induces drastic biological changes systemically, and has a beneficial effect on some autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, specific systemic changes that occur as a result of pregnancy have not been thoroughly examined in healthy women or women with RA. The goal of this study was to identify genes with expression patterns associated with pregnancy, compared to pre-pregnancy as baseline and determine whether those associations are modified by presence of RA.


RESULTS
In our RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset from 5 healthy women and 20 women with RA, normalized expression levels of 4,710 genes were significantly associated with pregnancy status (pre-pregnancy, first, second and third trimesters) over time, irrespective of presence of RA (False Discovery Rate (FDR)-adjusted p value<0.05). These genes were enriched in pathways spanning multiple systems, as would be expected during pregnancy. A subset of these genes (n = 256) showed greater than two-fold change in expression during pregnancy compared to baseline levels, with distinct temporal trends through pregnancy. Another 98 genes involved in various biological processes including immune regulation exhibited expression patterns that were differentially associated with pregnancy in the presence or absence of RA.


CONCLUSIONS

d15257c6d42ce0e2015d493ded343b099df2f4b1,Novel Statistical Methods Applied in Clinical Trials and Gut Microbiota,"Ethical clinical trials need both societal and personal equipoise. Recently, personal equipoise has been disturbed by the introduction of interim analyses; after an interim analysis has been performed the study administrators have additional information about the treatments, which is withheld from new recruits. For true informed consent, this information should be given to new study recruits to use in making a personal decision about their desired treatment. We present a method (and the rationale behind the method) that provides unbiased estimates of hazard ratios when new recruits are given information from interim analyses and allowed to choose their own treatments. We then developed a novel procedure that allows for the identification of longitudinal gut microbiota patterns (corresponding to the gut ecosystem evolving), which are associated with an outcome of interest, while appropriately controlling for the false discovery rate. Finally, using novel statistical models, we investigated the impact of POPs (in particular, non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl, IUPAC no.: 153; â€PCB153â€) on human health through the disruption of natural gut microbiota establishment in infants. We created novel distributed lag two-part models to account for the cumulative exposure of POPs.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Richard Aubrey White"", ids = ""49091191"")",,,,,
5e0d47d4fddfdd4b1616dae70696af657db6b044,Accelerated cortical thinning within structural brain networks is associated with irritability in youth,"Irritability is an important dimension of psychopathology that spans multiple clinical diagnostic categories, yet its relationship to patterns of brain development remains sparsely explored. Here, we examined how transdiagnostic symptoms of irritability relate to the development of structural brain networks. All participants (nâ€‰=â€‰137, 83 females) completed structural brain imaging with 3 Tesla MRI at two timepoints (mean age at follow-up: 21.1 years, mean inter-scan interval: 5.2 years). Irritability at follow-up was assessed using the Affective Reactivity Index, and cortical thickness was quantified using Advanced Normalization Tools software. Structural covariance networks were delineated using non-negative matrix factorization, a multivariate analysis technique. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with irritability at follow-up were evaluated using generalized additive models with penalized splines. The False Discovery Rate (qâ€‰<â€‰0.05) was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Cross-sectional analysis of follow-up data revealed that 11 of the 24 covariance networks were associated with irritability, with higher levels of irritability being associated with thinner cortex. Longitudinal analyses further revealed that accelerated cortical thinning within nine networks was related to irritability at follow-up. Effects were particularly prominent in brain regions implicated in emotion regulation, including the orbitofrontal, lateral temporal, and medial temporal cortex. Collectively, these findings suggest that irritability is associated with widespread reductions in cortical thickness and accelerated cortical thinning, particularly within the frontal and temporal cortex. Aberrant structural maturation of regions important for emotional regulation may in part underlie symptoms of irritability.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Robert J.

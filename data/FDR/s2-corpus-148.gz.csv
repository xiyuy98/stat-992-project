8c640bece6a260c402a88d745be00c517be1d2dd,Genome-wide pathway analysis in pancreatic cancer.,"The purpose of this study was to identify candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that might play a role in susceptibility to pancreatic cancer, elucidate their potential mechanisms, and generate SNP-to-gene-to-pathway hypotheses.A genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset of pancreatic cancer that included 496,959 SNPs from 3,851 pancreatic cancer patients and 3,934 control subjects of European descent was used in this study. The Identify candidate Causal SNPs and Pathways (ICSNPathway) method was applied to the GWAS dataset.ICSNPathway analysis identified 18 candidate SNPs, 11 genes (including HNF1A and HNF4G), and 30 pathways, which revealed 11 hypothetical biological mechanisms. The strongest hypothetical biological mechanism was one wherein rs2230739 alters the role of ADCY9 in various pathways and processes, including cyclase activity, phosphorus oxygen lyase activity, hsa04912, hsa04540, hsa04020, and hsa00230 (0.010 â‰¤ p < 0.001; 0.038 â‰¤ false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤ 0.016). The second strongest mechanism was that rs16859886 modulates ADCY10 to affect its role in pathways including cyclase activity, phosphorus oxygen lyase activity, nucleobase, nucleoside, and nucleotide metabolic processing, and hsa00230 (0.010 â‰¤ p < 0.001; 0.038 â‰¤ FDR â‰¤ 0.016).By using the ICSNPathway to analyze pancreatic cancer GWAS data, 18 candidate SNPs, 11 genes (including ADCY9, ADCY10, HNF1A, and HNF4G), and 30 pathways were identified that might contribute to the susceptibility of patients to pancreatic cancer.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Lee Yh"", ids = ""65733151""); list(name = ""G GyuSong"", ids = ""80869528"")",0cbb02eeea9bcb817123a209c8994ae77e51de90,,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,20,1565-1575
62a435515f958467e7363027b99fb5127f78a4f8,Novel Developmental Analyses Identify Longitudinal Patterns of Early Gut Microbiota that Affect Infant Growth,"It is acknowledged that some obesity trajectories are set early in life, and that rapid weight gain in infancy is a risk factor for later development of obesity. Identifying modifiable factors associated with early rapid weight gain is a prerequisite for curtailing the growing worldwide obesity epidemic. Recently, much attention has been given to findings indicating that gut microbiota may play a role in obesity development. We aim at identifying how the development of early gut microbiota is associated with expected infant growth. We developed a novel procedure that allows for the identification of longitudinal gut microbiota patterns (corresponding to the gut ecosystem developing), which are associated with an outcome of interest, while appropriately controlling for the false discovery rate. Our method identified developmental pathways of Staphylococcus species and Escherichia coli that were associated with expected growth, and traditional methods indicated that the detection of Bacteroides species at day 30 was associated with growth. Our method should have wide future applicability for studying gut microbiota, and is particularly important for translational considerations, as it is critical to understand the timing of microbiome transitions prior to attempting to manipulate gut microbiota in early life.",2013,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Richard A.

b0a8003939b352cae26ce97d235881c213915093,An efficient multi-locus mixed model approach for genome-wide association studies in structured populations,"Population structure causes genome-wide linkage disequilibrium between unlinked loci, leading to statistical confounding in genome-wide association studies. Mixed models have been shown to handle the confounding effects of a diffuse background of large numbers of loci of small effect well, but they do not always account for loci of larger effect. Here we propose a multi-locus mixed model as a general method for mapping complex traits in structured populations. Simulations suggest that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of power as well as false discovery rate. We apply our method to human and Arabidopsis thaliana data, identifying new associations and evidence for allelic heterogeneity. We also show how a priori knowledge from an A. thaliana linkage mapping study can be integrated into our method using a Bayesian approach. Our implementation is computationally efficient, making the analysis of large data sets (n > 10,000) practicable.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Vincent SÃ©gura"", ids = ""46913946""); list(name = ""Bjarni J.

1799c8723edd710a1c1d1e22b0a1d2e603851e01,Meta-analysis on the association between genetic polymorphisms and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response,"Sensorimotor gating measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response (ASR) has been proposed as one of the most promising electrophysiological endophenotypes of schizophrenia. During the past decade, a number of publications have reported significant associations between genetic polymorphisms and PPI in samples of schizophrenia patients and healthy volunteers. However, an overall evaluation of the robustness of these results has not been published so far. Therefore, we performed the first meta-analysis of published and unpublished associations between gene polymorphisms and PPI of ASR. Unpublished associations between genetic polymorphisms and PPI were derived from three independent samples. In total, 120 single observations from 16 independent samples with 2660 study participants and 43 polymorphisms were included. After correction for multiple testing based on false discovery rate and considering the number of analyzed polymorphisms, significant associations were shown for four variants, even though none of these associations survived a genome-wide correction (P<5âˆ—10-8). These results imply that PPI might be modulated by four genotypes - COMT rs4680 (primarily in males), GRIK3 rs1027599, TCF4 rs9960767, and PRODH rs385440 - indicating a role of these gene variations in the development of early information processing deficits in schizophrenia. However, the overall impact of single genes on PPI is still rather small suggesting that PPI is - like the disease phenotype - highly polygenic. Future genome-wide analyses studies with large sample sizes will enhance our understanding on the genetic architecture of PPI.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Boris B.

ec29d761ed33876c5810e8130123a797e55f2d5c,"Morphological, transcriptomics and biochemical characterization of new dwarf mutant of Brassica napus.","Plant height is a key trait of plant architecture, and is responsible for both yield and lodging resistance in Brassica napus. A dwarf mutant line (bnaC.dwf) was obtained by chemical mutagenesis of an inbred line T6. However, the molecular mechanisms and changed biological processes of the dwarf mutant remain to be determined. In this study, a comparative transcriptome analysis between bnaC.dwf and T6 plants was performed to identify genome-wide differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and possible biological processes that may explain the phenotype variations in bnaC.dwf. As a result of this analysis, 60,134,746-60,301,384 clean reads were aligned to 60,074 genes in the B. napus genome, and accounted for 60.03% of the annotated genes. In total, 819 differentially expressed genes were used for GO (Gene Ontology) term and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway enrichment analyses with a FDR (false discovery rate) criterion of <0.001, |log2Ratio|â€¯â‰¥â€¯1. We focused on plant hormone signal transduction pathways, plant-pathogen interaction pathway, protein phosphorylation and degradation pathways and sugar metabolism pathways. Taken together, the decrease in local auxin (IAA) levels, the variation in BnTCH4, BnKAN1, BnERF109, COI1-JAZ9-MYC2, auxin response genes (BnGH3.11, BnSAUR78, and AUX/IAA19), and ABA (abscisic acid) signaling genes (BnADP5, BnSnRK2.1, BnABF3.1) partially accounted for variations of cell proliferation in internodes, shoot and root apical meristem maintenance, abiotic and biotic stress resistance, and pre-harvest sprouting. As a comprehensive consequence of the cross-talk between plant hormones, sugar metabolism, plant-pathogen interactions and protein metabolism, bnaC.dwf presents distinct phenotypes from T6. These results will be helpful for shedding light on molecular mechanisms in the dwarf mutant, and give insight into further molecular breeding of semi-dwarf B. napus.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Chao Kun Wei"", ids = ""47152051""); list(name = ""Lixia Zhu"", ids = ""71991818""); list(name = ""Jing Wen"", ids = ""144711579""); list(name = ""Bin Yi"", ids = ""46803558""); list(name = ""Chaozhi Ma"", ids = ""6584155""); list(name = ""Jinxing Tu"", ids = ""1783882""); list(name = ""Jinxiong Shen"", ids = ""3965131""); list(name = ""Tingdong Fu"", ids = ""145182128"")",439cd27c0ec60aee09e5ef0034e749f975b2300f; c60ed20dcb8b8b70c7c8c168461b018fc1d830b2,,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,270,"

24dd47402687e5b9cdc5a4a510b518538808d0c9,Upregulation of stress-response genes with cell cycle arrest induced by carbon ion irradiation in multiple murine tumors models.,"OBJECTIVE
To elucidate the in vivo biological effects induced by carbon-ion irradiation using comprehensive expression analysis.


RESULTS
In all tumors, the level of expression of several tens of genes, including Ccl3, Ccng1, Cd80, Cdkn1a, Cxcl2, IL7r, Lrdd, Mgmt, Mmp8 and Polk, was significantly altered 6 h and day 1 following C-ion irradiation. At day 3, several hundred genes, many of which are also classified as stress-response or cell-communication genes, including Tnfrsf5, Ikbke and Icam1, were upregulated following C-ion irradiation. The expression level of the majority of these genes was similar following gamma-ray treatment, although the change was not as extensive and intertumor variance was apparent. Several genes, including Ikbke, Serpina3n and Saa3, responded differentially following C-ion irradiation than after gamma-ray irradiation. Pathological investigation and immunohistochemical analysis of Cdkn1a revealed cell cycle arrest with mitotic catastrophe in tumors irradiated by C-ions.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We examined gene expression changes after carbon-ion (C-ion) irradiation (290 MeV/m, SOBP 6 cm middle, 50 kev/microm) with a single dose of 30 Gy in four mouse tumors (NR-S1, SCCVII, NFSa and #8520) transplanted into the hind legs of C3H/HeNrs mice, using 44K single-color oligo-microarrays at six hours (h), one day and three days after irradiation. Gamma rays of 30 Gy and 50 Gy were used as a reference beam. Identification of C-ion-responsive genes was based on a false discovery rate of <5% using the Wilcoxon test (p < 0.001) and the Benjamini-Hochberg correction.

7ec68a870bd61810ee957b7ffaa3740da86ae9c7,Bias in the estimation of false discovery rate in microarray studies,"MOTIVATION
The false discovery rate (FDR) provides a key statistical assessment for microarray studies. Its value depends on the proportion pi(0) of non-differentially expressed (non-DE) genes. In most microarray studies, many genes have small effects not easily separable from non-DE genes. As a result, current methods often overestimate pi(0) and FDR, leading to unnecessary loss of power in the overall analysis.


METHODS
For the common two-sample comparison we derive a natural mixture model of the test statistic and an explicit bias formula in the standard estimation of pi(0). We suggest an improved estimation of pi(0) based on the mixture model and describe a practical likelihood-based procedure for this purpose.


RESULTS
The analysis shows that a large bias occurs when pi(0) is far from 1 and when the non-centrality parameters of the distribution of the test statistic are near zero. The theoretical result also explains substantial discrepancies between non-parametric and model-based estimates of pi(0). Simulation studies indicate mixture-model estimates are less biased than standard estimates. The method is applied to breast cancer and lymphoma data examples.

An R-package OCplus containing functions to compute pi(0) based on the mixture model, the resulting FDR and other operating characteristics of microarray data, is freely available at http://www.meb.ki.se/~yudpaw

ccabfdc02cc40af01475f4c08679eea1b118a48e,Microarray-based prediction of cytotoxicity of tumor cells to cantharidin.,"Cantharidin (CAN) is the active principle of the Chinese blister beetle (Mylabris phalerata) which exerts profound cytotoxicity towards tumor cells. The aim of this study was to identify the molecular determinants of sensitivity and resistance of tumor cells to CAN. We mined the microarray database of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), for genes whose expression correlated with the IC(50) values for CAN of 60 cell lines of different tumor types. By COMPARE analysis Kendall's tau test, and false discovery rate (FDR) analysis, 21 out of 9706 genes or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were identified. If the mRNA expression of the 21 genes or ESTs was subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and cluster image mapping, sensitivity or resistance of the 60 cell lines to CAN was predictable with statistical significance. The majority of these genes are involved in DNA damage response, DNA repair, and/or apoptosis. In conclusion, sensitivity or resistance of tumor cells to CAN is multi-factorial in nature. DNA repair and apoptosis play a major role as determinants of cellular response to CAN. The present investigation represents a starting point to dissect the genes and molecular pathways responsible for cellular response to cantharidin in more detail.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Thomas Efferth"", ids = ""3131602"")",f98cec7d9f553e4f9c64c092ed56bcc239ea2086; 5c46f6e42735f32e87b5e8784867d344d2c29cdd; 183f4a4078ac20f29840bc5097470dbecede4f1e; f63a49bd7d78c71e46ef016a3fbd6cb67ccc4378; 430a8701df2602b6ac5162f5cbb57ad13d15bd56; 68376cc53a1ca6011244ccb1c4fb676019f3579a; 250599ac7da1a298fa5334317b5c546379ee693c; ba01c62902abda88ec0aebe4c03372a87217d79e; c0dbf3bbd77b9dd89cbcc753817024034445181c; 1d75906e20a0f11581db85c859c982e0321a466e; 7f4a9bfca49beafb1090a0eb94d473e0eefd7594; 81bc479b3e4ac2526d6c5353a66d4fd756ba1de1; bc5ce4262a355be5e45977bd8c9e647dd9887105,,Oncology reports,13 3,"

Lesion studies in rats have indicated that the dorsal hippocampus preferentially plays a role in spatial learning and memory, while the ventral hippocampus is involved in anxiety-related behaviors. Based on such findings our aim was to investigate the molecular differentiation along the dorso-ventral axis of the hippocampal granular cell layer of the rat dentate gyrus. Homogeneous isolation of this specific area was performed by laser-capture microdissection and Illumina microarray chips were used to identify genes differentially expressed in dorsal and ventral granular cell layer, respectively. Selected genes were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. From the total amount of 22518 probes 229 genes were found to be differentially expressed between dorsal and ventral granular cell layer with a false discovery rate below 5% and with a relative change in gene expression level of 20% or more. From this pool of genes 45 genes were more than two-fold regulated, 13 genes being dorsally enriched and 32 genes being ventrally enriched. Moreover, cluster analysis based on all genes represented on the microarray chip showed a clear differentiation between dorsal and ventral subgroups. Our findings demonstrate a dorso-ventral differentiation in gene expression even at the subregional level of the rat hippocampus, more specifically in the granular cell layer, substantiating the existence of functional heterogeneity along the dorso-ventral axis of the hippocampus.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Thorkil Christensen"", ids = ""143911199""); list(name = ""Christina F.

95899c0bd8aed43166b0e06d3d0f8afcd39f3aa3,Genetics of human plasma lipidome: Understanding lipid metabolism and its link to diseases beyond traditional lipids,"Aim Genetic investigation of human plasma lipidome to get insights into lipid-related disorders beyond traditional lipid measures. Methods and Results We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 141 lipid species (n=2,181 individuals), followed by phenome-wide scans (PheWAS) with 44 clinical endpoints related to cardiometabolic, psychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders (n=456,941 individuals). SNP-based heritability for lipid species ranged from 0.10-0.54. Lipids with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids showed higher heritability and genetic sharing, suggesting considerable genetic regulation at acyl chains levels. We identified 35 genomic regions associated with at least one lipid species (P<5Ã—10âˆ’8), revealing 37 new SNP-lipid species pair associations e.g. new association between ABCG5/8 and CE(20:2;0). PheWAS of lipid-species-associated loci suggested new associations of BLK with obesity, FADS2 with thrombophlebitis, and BLK and SPTLC3 with gallbladder disease (false discovery rate <0.05). The association patterns of lipid-species-associated loci supplied clues to their probable roles in lipid metabolism e.g. suggestive role of SYNGR1, MIR100HG, and PTPRN2 in desaturation and/or elongation of fatty acids. At known lipid loci (FADS2, APOA5 and LPL), genetic associations provided detailed insights to their roles in lipid biology and diseases. We also show that traditional lipid measures may fail to capture lipids such as lysophospatidylcholines (LPCs) and phosphatidylcholines (PCs) that are potential disease risk factors, but are not included in routine screens. The full genome-wide association statistics are available on the web-based database (http://35.205.141.92).

The goal of this study was to identify genomic regions and genes for CL with or without CP (CL/P). Methods: We performed linkage analyses of a 10 cM genome scan in 820 multiplex CL/P families (6,565 individuals). Significant linkage results were followed by association analyses of 1,476 SNPs in candidate genes and regions, utilizing a weighted false discovery rate (wFDR) approach to control for multiple testing and incorporate the genome scan results. Results: Significant (multipoint HLOD â‰¥3.2) or genome-wide-significant (HLOD â‰¥4.02) linkage results were found for regions 1q32, 2p13, 3q27-28, 9q21, 12p11, 14q21-24 and 16q24. SNPs in IRF6 (1q32) and in or near FOXE1 (9q21) reached formal genome-wide wFDR-adjusted significance. Further, results were phenotype dependent in that the IRF6 region results were most significant for families in which affected individuals have CL alone, and the FOXE1 region results were most significant in families in which some or all of the affected individuals have CL with CP. Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of careful phenotypic delineation in large samples of families for genetic analyses of complex, heterogeneous traits such as CL/P.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mary L.

3c1c4e496cbf862d5b812b8aa3c6e9ae3d2b0e14,Systematic Identification and Analysis of Expression Profiles of mRNAs and Incrnas in Macrophage Inflammatory Response,"ABSTRACT Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), once thought to be transcriptional noise, have been recently shown to regulate a variety of biological processes. However, their roles in the inflammatory response are largely unexplored. In this study, we performed high-throughput sequencing to identify the profiles of mRNA and lncRNA transcriptomes in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, followed by a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. We found a total of 325 lncRNAs and 1,187 mRNAs to be significantly dysregulated in RAW264.7 cells stimulated with LPS (fold change >4.0 or <0.25, false discovery rate <0.01). Further validation with qRT-PCR demonstrated that Cd40 and Traf1 mRNAs were significantly upregulated, whereas Slc43a2 and Ccnd1 were downregulated in RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS. Gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the altered mRNAs and lncRNAs were mainly involved in the immune response, inflammation response, chemokine receptor binding, protein binding, and regulation of cytokine production. KEGG pathway analysis showed that altered lncRNAs and mRNAs were significantly enriched in immune- and inflammation-related signaling pathways, such as Herpes simplex infection, cytokineâ€“cytokine receptor interaction, and TNF, PI3K-Akt, MAPK, NF-&kgr;B, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. lncRNA-mRNA network analysis showed that the coexpression network profile for mRNAs and lncRNAs from the immune category consisted of 93 network nodes and 145 connections among 70 differentially expressed mRNAs and 23 dysregulated lncRNAs, suggesting that lncRNAs play an important role in the regulation of functional mRNA expression in LPS-induced inflammation.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lei Li"", ids = ""50703861""); list(name = ""Yankui Zhang"", ids = ""46867397""); list(name = ""Haihua Luo"", ids = ""34148753""); list(name = ""Chenyang Huang"", ids = ""48908356""); list(name = ""Shan Li"", ids = ""22212559""); list(name = ""Aihua Liu"", ids = ""144730219""); list(name = ""Yong Jiang"", ids = ""145859335"")",f97d1cb4af4f4d542c8a83d7231956785aacd6e9,24b67d6b516b30ebc2d67e8914277a8685ceb8e5; f8b15b2af1e484486a21b7b23c651833e3fe1397; 46787ae7976030814c7a0a9b786dcee821bd244a; 59e2253cfaaeb338590a0eb53b91f1f9a3c36039; 04f990e77f549bb2c3845accdba2a0240272c4bb; 1753efc613af2f4deab38171027cb3e0e45f8549; 14720113389473fcebd0a226c3cdb81099f7ac96; 0ddb3b9f9ca10eac6581fc4f226876c283315b6a; 9dd8031a4f7ddfc075148dca94a0b1bef9f4afe2; f473cfa5676f973872b091be0ad6175ace7aa0b9; 555760a7cfa340ed905844a6145753a081320db7; 8f2141a84339f320ab388b263bb450b1f5d9158d; 4b84ac3192918eca8f88a30fbfe00bab5ba346da; 6d09163a67522069d082b98e8c51ab3a695e5f73; bed435222ddb9e9390677ad3eef22422468512e8; 5dbba6bd1e6841fee6f9549e38f050b7e91858be; e8096f77d96410845f4343f8a123c75f43f641fc; a6d3ecc910e6ae8bd57282f97e060012fc98d98c; ad08d996f3b7ee6fb0b5de8f3f541751631a4777; 2371accfa43210d263e445493e9d43ad940ff987; ada7bac12eb78f8d9c8562f0ee0227f97b616b77; b029b29da941e337ffd311281336bc385e7094fb; 807aa6a9d0adb7f695cdb20643777fe1700ebe19; 7d597047bac02ae6c67b0e4c7c2e6045cf39c828; 78f7d505a8841caeb9c3e08fce8948e34caa69ab; 51a2f0041796b3fa527ea9a64cc3683b39b1c39f; f1bfbfea4eb2e8e4b73ebe6dc1775e28c74cf727; 65a7c5603370ae6b46fc9fea6e6a291e679bec9a; 6e3bdcaac7b8f9be6bb8153319f424cf18e54735; 5fd4a419e5772246c00300b19dd4655fcfbdd4fb; 306145655e3e9adaf8ceceed760b8372292fae8e; 636dec7febfd0f488eef005cf2b34fc46ad855d9; a29f83c92a24109c393ed5eadd0b5129d4f873cd; 5ba323f2a0ddf59ebf6298cbbb847bec6834ad85; 3c6fa86b725cb112a6bf364e2ca52a79699ca53b,SHOCK,51,770â€“779
fa12de18e21d3a9661691a4c759eac5d55f6e45a,Identifying nineteenth century genealogical links from genotypes,"We have developed a likelihood method to identify moderately distant genealogical relationships from genomewide scan data. The aim is to compare the genotypes of many pairs of people and identify those pairs most likely to be related to one another. We have tested the algorithm using the genotypes of 170 Tasmanians with multiple sclerosis recruited into a haplotype association study. It is estimated from genealogical records that approximately 65% of Tasmaniaâ€™s current population of 470,000 are direct descendants of the 13,000 female founders living in this island state of Australia in the mid-nineteenth century. All cases and four to five relatives of each case have been genotyped with microsatellite markers at a genomewide average density of 4Â cM. Previous genealogical research has identified 51 pairwise relationships linking 56 of the 170 cases. Testing the likelihood calculation on these known relative pairs, we have good power to identify relationships up to degree eight (e.g. third cousins once removed). Applying the algorithm to all other pairs of cases, we have identified a further 61 putative relative pairs, with an estimated false discovery rate of 10%. The power to identify genealogical links should increase when the new, denser sets of SNP markers are used. Except in populations where there is a searchable electronic database containing virtually all genealogical links in the past six generations, the algorithm should be a useful aid for genealogists working on gene-mapping projects, both linkage studies and association studies.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jim M Stankovich"", ids = ""4937936""); list(name = ""Melanie Bahlo"", ids = ""2456658""); list(name = ""Justin P.

Methods Saliva samples were collected from 45 patients with RAU and 49 healthy individuals, and the salivary metabolites were quantified using liquid chromatographyâ€“tandem mass spectrometry. The metabolomic profiles were then analyzed using multivariate and univariate statistical methods, and enrichment of the metabolites in various biological pathways was assessed. Results In total, 206 significant differentiating metabolites (Wilcoxon test, false discovery rate [FDR] of <0.05) were identified between patients with RAU and healthy individuals. These metabolites were implicated in tryptophan metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and other metabolic pathways. Two commonly circulating steroids, estrone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, were significantly lower in the saliva of patients with RAU (Wilcoxon test, FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05, powerâ€‰>â€‰0.9).

O estudo 2 teve como objetivo caracterizar as vias metabolicas associadas ao inicio da lactacao em vacas Holandesas utilizando dados de RNA-seq obtidos de amostras de tecido adiposo subcutÃ¢neo coletadas em tres momentos: em 2 (T0), 30 (T1) e 90 (T3) dias apos o parto. No estudo 1 foi explorado a metilacao de dinucleotideos citosina-guanina (CpGs) em populacoes de espermatozoides de AM e BM de Bos taurus separados por Percoll. Padroes de metilacao de espermatozoides de alta e baixa motilidade foram investigados por sequenciamento de bissulfito. A comparacao entre as populacoes desses espermatozoides revelou que a variacao da metilacao afeta os genes envolvidos na organizacao da cromatina, no qual houve metilacao em genes associados a remodelacao da estrutura do DNA, bem como em um elemento repetitivo BTSAT4 em regioes pericentromericas. Desta forma, sugere-se que a manutencao da estrutura cromossomica atraves da regulacao epigenetica seja crucial para a funcionalidade correta do espermatozoide. Para o estudo 2, o RNA total foi extraido a partir do tecido adiposo subcutÃ¢neo no dia do parto (T0), 30 dias apos o parto (T1) e noventa dias apos o parto (T3), e comparacoes foram feitas entre os grupos mencionados.

a126e9bbcdce1b4ca4a3da33fecae9a35addf2ee,Reconocimiento de redes de genes mediante regresiÃ³n,"Novel strategies are required in order to handle the huge amount of data
produced by microarray technologies. To infer gene regulatory networks,
the first step is to find direct regulatory relationships between genes building
the so-called gene co-expression networks, i.e. it is filling gaps in the
metabolic networks. They are typically built using correlation statistics as
pairwise similarity measures. Correlation methods are very useful in order
to determine whether two genes have a strong global similarity but do not
detect local similarities.
We propose model trees as a method to identify gene interaction networks.
Model trees are very useful techniques to estimate the numerical
values for the target genes by linear regression functions. They are very
often more precise than linear regression models because they can adjust
different linear regressions to separate areas of the search space favoring to
infer localized similarities over a more global similarity. While correlationbased
methods analyze each pairs of genes, in our approach we generate a
single regression tree for each gene from a set of genes, taking the remaining
genes as input. Finally, a graph from all the relationships among output and
input genes is built taking into account whether the pair of genes is statistically
significant. For this reason we apply a statistical procedure to control
the false discovery rate. The performance of our approach named RegNet
is experimentally tested on the well-known data set Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
Furthermore, we analyze a data set from normal and Alzheimer's
disease-affected subjects. In this case, our result provide new evidences for
the hypothesis that cardiovascular, diabetes type 2 and Alzheimer's disease
are linked.
The application of information encoded in molecular networks for prognostic
purposes is a crucial objective of systems biomedicine. Standard approaches
to biomarker discovery are based on the identification of differentially
expressed genes. However, it is known that biomarkers may be encoded
by genes that are not highly differentially expressed across control and disease patients. Network-based prognostic approaches have not been widely
investigated in the cardiovascular research area where the prediction of clinical
outcome would represent a significant contribution to translational
research. We developed a new supervised prediction method for this prognostic
problem based on the discovery of clinically-relevant transcriptional
association networks (obtained by RegNet). The new method named SA-
TuRNo integrates clinical class-specific networks, and can be applied to
other clinical domains.
Before analyzing our cardiovascular disease dataset, we tested the usefulness
of our approach on a benchmark dataset with control and disease
patients. We also compared it to several algorithms to infer transcriptional
association networks and classification models. Comparative results provided
evidence of the prediction power of our approach. Next, we discovered new
models for predicting good and bad outcomes after myocardial infarction.
Using blood-derived gene expression data, our models reported areas under
the receiver operating characteristic curve above 0.70. Our model could also
outperform different techniques based on co-expressed gene modules. We
also predicted processes that may represent novel therapeutic targets for
heart disease, such as the synthesis of leucine and isoleucine. To conclude,
gene association networks provide new insights into underlying molecular
mechanisms leading to bad prognosis after Miocardial Infarction and set the
basis for potential novel prognostic models in Heart Failure.
Finally, the integration of huge databases with searching techniques in
order to automatically validate results from different sources is a key factor
in bioinformatics. Several tools have been developed for analysing geneenrichment
in terms. Most of them are Gene Ontology-based tools, i.e.,
these analyse gene-enrichment in GO annotations. In this work, we introduce
a software tool, named CarGene (Characterisation of Genes), that helps
scientists to validate sets of genes by using the biological knowledge on metabolic
pathways stored in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(Kegg), and providing a friendly graphical environment to analyse and compare
results generated by different clustering and/or biclustering techniques.
CarGene is based on the degree of coherence of genes in (bi)clusters with
respect to metabolic pathways of organisms stored in Kegg, and provides an
estimate of obtaining results by chance, including two statistical corrections
(Bonferroni, andWestfall and Young). One of the most important features of
CarGene is the possibility of simultaneously comparing and statistically
analysing the information about many groups of genes in both visual and
textual manner. Furthermore, it includes its own web browser to explore in
detail the information extracted from Kegg.",2011,Biology,"list(name = ""Isabel A. Nepomuceno-Chamorro"", ids = ""1399137966"")",,,,,
e37ce084232f25088b9db53a48f2d4b0161c6ede,Detection of systemic inflammation in severely impaired chronic pain patients and effects of a multimodal pain rehabilitation program,"Abstract Background and aims Recent research indicates a previously unknown low-grade systemic or neurogenic inflammation in groups of chronic pain (CP) patients. Low-grade inflammation may have an important role in symptoms that have previously not been well depicted: widespread pain, tiredness and cognitive dysfunctions frequently seen in severely impaired CP patients. This study aimed to investigate the plasma inflammatory profile in a group of very complex CP patients at baseline and at a 1-year follow-up after participation in a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)-based multimodal pain rehabilitation program (PRP). Methods Blood samples were collected from 52 well-characterized CP patients. Age- and sex-matched healthy blood donors served as controls. The samples were analyzed with a multiple Proximal Extension Analysis allowing a simultaneous analysis of 92 inflammation-related proteins consisting mainly of cytokines, chemokines and growth-factors. At follow-up, 1-year after participation in the RPR samples from 28 patients were analyzed. The results were confirmed by a multi-array technology that allows quantitative estimation. Results Clear signs of increased inflammatory activity were detected in the CP patients. Accepting a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, there were significant differences in 43/92 inflammatory biomarkers compared with the controls. In three biomarkers (CXCL5, SIRT2, AXIN1) the expression levels were elevated more than eight times. One year after the PRP, with the patients serving as their own controls, a significant decrease in overall inflammatory activity was found. Conclusions Our results indicate that the most impaired CP patients suffer from low-grade chronic systemic inflammation not described earlier with this level of detail. The results may have implications for a better understanding of the cluster of co-morbid symptoms described as the â€œsickness-syndromeâ€ and the wide-spread pain seen in this group of patients. The decrease in inflammatory biomarkers noted at the follow-up after participation in the PRP may reflect the positive effects obtained on somatic and psycho-social mechanisms involved in the inflammatory process by a rehabilitation program. Besides the PRP, no major changes in medication or lifestyle factors were implemented during the same period. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting that a PRP may induce inflammatory-reducing effects. Further studies are needed to verify the objective findings in CP patients and address the question of causality that remains to be solved. Implications The findings offer a new insight into the complicated biological processes underlying CP. It may have implications for the understanding of symptoms collectively described as the â€œsickness-syndromeâ€ â€“ frequently seen in this group of patients. The lowering of cytokines after the participation in a PRP indicate a new way to evaluate this treatment; by measuring inflammatory biomarkers.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eva-Britt Hysing"", ids = ""49682386""); list(name = ""Lena Smith"", ids = ""79828653""); list(name = ""MÃ¥ns Thulin"", ids = ""10250373""); list(name = ""Rolf Karlsten"", ids = ""49052156""); list(name = ""Kristoffer Bothelius"", ids = ""12885815""); list(name = ""Torsten E Gordh"", ids = ""4550651"")",4361852ae7f4a60efb02ab9a59d3af56bb59479b; 3316bca5a4ef77236df8f35c25ba0352c6d8581e; 479d7c5802567dcef163c1a52fdbceb5ad8e8b0f; 5e081a987fddd8a5149403f163216d0dee33bf1f,e84912f55b967e02d1126d1513370eb55cb78ce1; e6caa51eeb4423f9001e79821d376b4f454e1433; f1a09c7b1ce183ea640ca23ba935c513efa6c7e7; 53677f1d9a2511d75fe7d020a93c9fa563bc7a1b; d0c80ff613a4d866f63f69a126c04af18f02a1df; b2c290d23880f26b42d3ffc66a4bb5f5c9a75083; fc5e034196286ee2145a4f723c70fba8aae7f006; ee8ce24b9afd2334620beab8e6d82eecb34e690d; d902e896019a96efc05ae57f2cce12aeb160559f; 02ada1231b2efb07c0bd29b70fddf4ea5309030c; 34229d94fb3b4c6d2fa85f074421d604ec60f571; 696eda9b067335f4f57eed1e66b69701b8aac0ac; 991ff6634baca0732b9f23da84d2826cbb1c0f0b; 52bf94b39998e29bbebf5868cd4daa9c9a734d58; b4f472b643024f621c7310d684bc8e247e3f05b3; 551da0be98e63dda2c32399476d8e481fb790d80; c6656e32140b1f2e03d50a5db1669c4c40457727; 0f44d1c4eaeba9496136d2558244524c4ca1e0c2; 3e63a620d337b028ed0b6aeedcaad5e42a10e794; 0460632462b86160bb36a419011c85990ca2f5bb; a5301eae53f9d7acc8e3b36f639ea97cfc40f9f8; f6dec5c66cb547b9a917a3f43731bef38cba9641; 9ee8d9a492a5601082a999c8796ad25b54528f28; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 5082f6dd27c1d0dc876ce36a16b575a8efc30b58; 454e58c4eed16ea976d6fa3a9ec9971b016269f7; cca5b515c11620bd98299aa77e5629f498a66b3b; dde336550557ac1c1595d8c7b97a5ba5caae2775; f95ab8171a63c7051bf5f6006429a06ec50adcd3; ccd10d18d1ffcd2f0dc3daf28e8d1b0feba3f9ab; e6e6c31d8d766aec4df8f3c6f9e5900b32f4c75e; 17f7b480a7398331b8a676282c69f3ad938e2202; 0d8e4326b69258fadc8421d854860d218aace4bc; 63c88900cec574f710ecf830a3857b692fe68358; 468ea242d4e050059170ec65f28c7722b04bf592; d2d6af3a669f10dbb1c68a525409350cd9431d5b; 94f9f3b0b209bb2c6cc9694477b8b353dc202145; 2e7bd25cb4fc05412c63b7b9f8da0c4b3294bfd6; 6a2e77bcb8eec07a84a4396e60ff900ebaefabbf; 5f5020f78a7bc31ec5824e3e1d0395264b2618a0; e40e556e43674399459f1c42afb216afb6068317; fd4724c1eb4df16a20ae2b00f55425ae16dcecb1; 0746ac8995dceccbd29686cb9ac9142fc9526cc5; 87b18c8b41db473f369bb33729c9e971b3814f26; e6cd9991d7da887457817ecf7d9d7f9c6df80632; 6822b28cbe316ecb265405feb93d9a0f8c5e33d5; d8b32a47553253452ec0da362ec6d376793ccf21; acd0d5d89cec63228f20ca03d8a59e242e5363af; 25080f5d9b46a87e49d98d888779f977666ed33e; b39158dae858fa7568dba42767d11c5fde7247f3; ce88f742567453a672547646aa68bde285f5771c; 4f40d9fc205e43c81e82e2afea60307a79dac95c; 48d43bf0eb0d32a8521488f33537c48a5cd6e6c9; bfb0207b5d1753e948126d8787280a98ee36daed; da15b6e1b13cef6c65cb8211f1d5d6dbb4d20049; a314a7be7021c5d09397fb737f70a897d4be0dec; c6729d97527edf84e796615bc7adf2a0b040e505; e0bbbef1827d8f68826d317f0f84b7799345fe81; 2fc0c3d0a35349126d969baf80e12ed0a04454c0,Scandinavian Journal of Pain,19,235 - 244

We hypothesised that identifying proteins co-purifying with RNAP in stationary phase would make possible to discover the sigma factors active in this condition. We thus used a tandem affinity purification approach to isolate S. meliloti RNAP. A strain expressing a tagged form of the ï¢' subunit of RNAP at wild type (wt) levels was generated by introduction of a 217 bp extension encoding the SPA-tag at the 3' end of the native chromosomal copy of the rpoC gene. The resulting strain (CBT789) grew as efficiently as the wt strain (GMI11495) at 28Â°C in either rich LBMC medium or Vincent minimal medium supplemented with sodium succinate as carbon source. This indicates that the tagged RNAP efficiently interacts with the vegetative sigma factor RpoD as well as with the alternative sigma factor RpoN required for succinate utilisation [1]. An RpoE2-dependent promoter-lacZ reporter fusion was also found to be inducible following a heat shock in this strain (not shown), demonstrating that the tagged RNAP is able to interact with the ECF sigma factor RpoE2. Altogether, these observations indicated that the tagged RNAP was fully active and able to interact with both vegetative and alternative sigma factors. rpoC-SPA cells grown in minimal medium to either exponential or early stationary phase were used to isolate RNAP by tandem affinity purification. As a control, the same treatment was applied to wt (untagged) S. meliloti cells. Purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and coomassie staining revealed a number of discrete bands in lanes corresponding to the rpoC-spa samples, as expected, whereas no band was visible from the control samples. As no qualitative or quantitative difference was visible between the two rpoC-spa samples, gel lanes were sliced, proteins were in-gel digested with trypsine and subjected to liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The whole experiment was repeated twice independently, and only proteins represented in both repeats of each condition were kept for further analysis. A complete list of the proteins identified and validated with a false discovery rate < 1% is given in Table S3.

7ad8ec2bcc091ec2a6c77609122e3a2da9f5dbbf,Association of Synergistetes and Cyclodipeptides with Periodontitis,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbial community (MC) composition as it relates to salivary metabolites and periodontal clinical parameters in a 21-d biofilm-overgrowth model. Subjects (N = 168) were enrolled equally into 5 categories of periodontal status per the biofilm-gingival interface classification. Microbial species within subgingival plaque samples were identified by human microbiome identification microarray. Whole saliva was analyzed by liquid chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry and gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry for metabolite identification. Phylum was grouped into MCs according to principal component analysis. Generalized linear and regression models were used to examine the association among MC, species, periodontal clinical parameters, and salivary metabolome. Multiple comparisons were adjusted with the false discovery rate. The study population was distributed into 8 distinct MC profiles, designated MC-1 to MC-8. MC-2 explained 14% of the variance and was dominated by Synergistetes and Spirochaetes. It was the only community structure significantly associated with high probing depth (P = 0.02) and high bleeding on probing (P = 0.008). MC-2 was correlated with traditional periodontal pathogens and several newly identified putative periodontal pathogens: Fretibacterium fastidiosum, Fretibacterium sp. OT360/OT362, Filifactor alocis, Treponema lecithinolyticum, Eubacterium saphenum, Desulfobulbus sp./OT041, and Mogibacterium timidum. Synergistetes phylum was strongly associated with 2 novel metabolitesâ€”cyclo (-leu-pro) and cyclo (-phe-pro)â€”at 21 d of biofilm overgrowth (P = 0.02). In subjects with severe periodontitis (P2 and P3), cyclo (-leu-pro) and cyclo (-phe-pro) were significantly associated with increased changes in probing depth at 21 d of biofilm overgrowth (P â‰¤ 0.05). The analysis identified a MC dominated by Synergistetes, with classic and putative newly identified pathogens/pathobionts associated with clinical disease. The metabolomic discovery of 2 novel cyclodipeptides that have been reported to serve as quorum-sensing and/or bacteriocidal/bacteriostatic molecules, in association with Synergistetes, suggests a potential role in periodontal biofilm dysbiosis and periodontal disease that warrants further investigation.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Julie Teresa Marchesan"", ids = ""3690214""); list(name = ""Thiago Morelli"", ids = ""36009939""); list(name = ""Kevin Lee Moss"", ids = ""37105051""); list(name = ""S.

Such a multivariate selection takes into account the interactions between variables but is not easy to interpret in a statistical sense. We propose a statistical procedure to measure variable importance that tests if variables are significantly useful in combination with others in a forest. We show experimentally that this new importance index correctly identifies relevant variables. The top of the variable ranking is, as expected, largely correlated with Breimanâ€™s importance index based on a permutation test.

One open problem in this context is represented by the definition of an appropriate significance threshold that takes into account the multiple comparison problem. We explore the con- ceptual and practical implications of the multiple testing procedure known as False Discovery Rate (FDR). We argue that controlling the FDR better represents the interest of researcher in this area than more traditional approaches. We then explore the applicability of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) FDR controlling procedure in the specific context of association mapping from case-control data. We analyze the nature of dependency between the test statistics with an- alytic work and simulations and we conclude that the BH rule effectively controls FDR in our context of interest. The dependency between test statistics translates into a decrease of power, which highlights the necessity of developing resampling based rules to control FDR.",2002,Geography,"list(name = ""Chiara Sabatti"", ids = ""2139035""); list(name = ""Nelson B.

4a438b60a080977bb95b2b764a07a528bc7ca900,Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Brain Morphology Study in Infants and Toddlers With Down Syndrome: The Effect of Comorbidities.,"BACKGROUND
Down syndrome (DS) is the most prevalent chromosomal disorder characterized by intellectual disability, multiple organ anomalies, generalized muscular hypotonia, and characteristic physical features. The presence of DS-associated medical comorbidities has contributed to brain morphologic changes. The aim of this study was to evaluate brain morphologic characteristics during infant and toddler ages in patients with DS using structural brain magnetic resonance imaging.


METHODS
Structural brain T1-weighted magnetic resonance images from participants with DS with complete chromosome 21 trisomy (nÂ = 20; 1.6 Â± 0.6 [mean Â± standard deviation] years old) were analyzed using FreeSurfer. The measurements were compared with those of 60 gender- and age-matched neurotypical controls by Cohen's d statistic and unpaired t test with false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons and analyzed using a univariate general linear model with the following DS-associated medical comorbidities: congenital cardiac disease, infantile spasms, and hypothyroidism.


RESULTS
We identified 27 candidate measurements with large effect sizes (absolute d > 0.8) and statistically significant differences (P < 6.9Â Ã— 10-3). Among them were decreased volumes in bilateral cerebellar gray matter and right cerebellar white matter and brainstem and cortical abnormalities in the right superior temporal, right rostral anterior cingulate, and left rostral middle frontal gyrus, independent of comorbid effects. Only bilateral cerebellar gray matter volumes and brainstem volume showed differences between DS and healthy groups during infancy.


CONCLUSION
These results suggest that cerebellar gray matter and brainstem may represent the primary regions affected by the presence of an additional copy of chromosome 21.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tadashi Shiohama"", ids = ""2638762""); list(name = ""Jacob Levman"", ids = ""48702879""); list(name = ""Nicole Baumer"", ids = ""10785219""); list(name = ""Emi Takahashi"", ids = ""3457491"")",46b0a560efa1f3e6e41db2c2184a6c93296c4a63; 70149f8469a2f7038407cd07fc32ca834470e7cf,,Pediatric neurology,,

Many research in geography and spatial economics have been addressing this issue to explain and theorize such mechanism. This paper proposes a new statistical approach that allows extracting coagglomeration patterns of industries from available national datasets. The approach takes two steps; the first step finds spatial clusters of each industry using the false discovery rate-controlling statistical test, and the second step searches for colocation relationships among industries through the frequent pattern mining of detected cluster location and the Monte Carlo simulation. This approach identifies coagglomeration patterns of industries. The proposed new method is applied to the 500-meter grid data of the 2012 Economic Census for Business Frame of Japan, to check its applicability and validity. _______________________________________________________ R.

5e77864f4cb820911d2e32d127fdf6f54eb16cb3,Persistent epigenetic changes in adult daughters of older mothers.,"Women of advanced maternal age account for an increasing proportion of live births in many developed countries across the globe. Offspring of older mothers are at an increased risk for a variety of subsequent health outcomes, including outcomes that do not manifest until childhood or adulthood. The molecular underpinnings of the association between maternal aging and offspring morbidity remain elusive. However, one possible mechanism is that maternal aging produces specific alterations in the offspring's epigenome in utero, and these epigenetic alterations persist into adulthood. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of the effect of a mother's age on blood DNA methylation in 2,740 adult daughters using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 array. A false discovery rate (FDR) q-value threshold of 0.05 was used to identify differentially methylated CpG sites (dmCpGs). We identified 87 dmCpGs associated with increased maternal age. The majority (84%) of the dmCpGs had lower methylation in daughters of older mothers, with an average methylation difference of 0.6% per 5-year increase in mother's age. Thirteen genomic regions contained multiple dmCpGs. Most notably, nine dmCpGs were found in the promoter region of the gene LIM homeobox 8 (LHX8), which plays a pivotal role in female fertility. Other dmCpGs were found in genes associated with metabolically active brown fat, carcinogenesis, and neurodevelopmental disorders. We conclude that maternal age is associated with persistent epigenetic changes in daughters at genes that have intriguing links to health.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Aaron M.

Study Design Observational assessment of DNA copy number, miRNA, and RNA expression in primary and metastatic OSCC. Setting University of Washington Medical Center and affiliated hospitals. Subjects Tumor samples were taken from patients with primary incident OSCC; cells were laser-capture microdissected from 17 nonmetastatic primary tumors and 20 metastatic lymph nodes. Methods DNA copy number aberrations and gene expression profiles were previously determined using Affymetrix 250K Nsp I SNP arrays and HU133 plus 2.0 expression arrays. miRNAs were interrogated with Exiqonâ€™s Ready-to-Use PCR Panels assessing the expression of 368 human miRNAs. Results Investigators found 31 miRNAs differentially expressed between metastatic and nonmetastatic samples (false discovery rate <0.4; 26 overexpressed and 5 underexpressed in metastatic samples). Expression of 7 of these miRNAs was significantly associated with their DNA copy numbers, and expressions of 8 of these miRNAs were significantly associated with their target genes. Among these unique miRNAs, miR-140-3p, miR-29c, and miR-29a were differentially expressed in metastasis versus nonmetastatic samples and had a strong positive correlation with their DNA copy numbers and a negative correlation with the expression of their target genes. Conclusion Results suggest that DNA copy number aberration may play a role in the dysregulation of some differentially expressed miRNAs in OSCC metastasis, warranting further investigation.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Nicholas A.

fb2f539e1c7ea40c9f218d507094fd8235b73fcb,Use of the false discovery rate for evaluating clinical safety data,"Clinical adverse experience (AE) data are routinely evaluated using between group P values for every AE encountered within each of several body systems. If the P values are reported and interpreted without multiplicity considerations, there is a potential for an excess of false positive findings. Procedures based on confidence interval estimates of treatment effects have the same potential for false positive findings as P value methods. Excess false positive findings can needlessly complicate the safety profile of a safe drug or vaccine. Accordingly, we propose a novel method for addressing multiplicity in the evaluation of adverse experience data arising in clinical trial settings. The method involves a two-step application of adjusted P values based on the Benjamini and Hochberg1 false discovery rate (FDR). Data from three moderate to large vaccine trials are used to illustrate our proposed â€˜Double FDRâ€™ approach, and to reinforce the potential impact of failing to account for multiplicity. This work was in collaboration with the late Professor John W. Tukey who coined the term â€˜Double FDRâ€™.",2004,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Devan V.

0526a79d4c1493f211baac1551714e5eb4e3c68c,Shared common variants in prostate cancer and blood lipids.,"BACKGROUND
Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest comorbidity between prostate cancer (PCA) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. However, the relationship between these two phenotypes is still not well understood. Here we sought to identify shared genetic loci between PCA and CVD risk factors.


METHODS
We applied a genetic epidemiology method based on conjunction false discovery rate (FDR) that combines summary statistics from different genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and allows identification of genetic overlap between two phenotypes. We evaluated summary statistics from large, multi-centre GWA studies of PCA (n=50 000) and CVD risk factors (n=200 000) [triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, waist-hip ratio and type 2 diabetes (T2D)]. Enrichment of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PCA and CVD risk factors was assessed with conditional quantile-quantile plots and the Anderson-Darling test. Moreover, we pinpointed shared loci using conjunction FDR.


RESULTS
We found the strongest enrichment of P-values in PCA was conditional on LDL and conditional on TG. In contrast, we found only weak enrichment conditional on HDL or conditional on the other traits investigated. Conjunction FDR identified altogether 17 loci; 10 loci were associated with PCA and LDL, 3 loci were associated with PCA and TG and additionally 4 loci were associated with PCA, LDL and TG jointly (conjunction FDRâ€‰<0.01). For T2D, we detected one locus adjacent to HNF1B.


CONCLUSIONS
We found polygenic overlap between PCA predisposition and blood lipids, in particular LDL and TG, and identified 17 pleiotropic gene loci between PCA and LDL, and PCA and TG, respectively. These findings provide novel pathobiological insights and may have implications for trials using targeting lipid-lowering agents in a prevention or cancer setting.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ole Andreas Andreassen"", ids = ""1777021""); list(name = ""Verena Zuber"", ids = ""2882566""); list(name = ""Wesley K.

e082861b8572cfe785bfcbcfd9acb71c37bb8517,Validation of Splicing Events in Transcriptome Sequencing Data,"Genomic alignments of sequenced cellular messenger RNA contain gapped alignments which are interpreted as consequence of intron removal. The resulting gap-sites, genomic locations of alignment gaps, are landmarks representing potential splice-sites. As alignment algorithms report gap-sites with a considerable false discovery rate, validations are required. We describe two quality scores, gap quality score (gqs) and weighted gap information score (wgis), developed for validation of putative splicing events: While gqs solely relies on alignment data wgis additionally considers information from the genomic sequence. FASTQ files obtained from 54 human dermal fibroblast samples were aligned against the human genome (GRCh38) using TopHat and STAR aligner. Statistical properties of gap-sites validated by gqs and wgis were evaluated by their sequence similarity to known exon-intron borders. Within the 54 samples, TopHat identifies 1,000,380 and STAR reports 6,487,577 gap-sites. Due to the lack of strand information, however, the percentage of identified GT-AG gap-sites is rather low. While gap-sites from TopHat contain â‰ˆ89% GT-AG, gap-sites from STAR only contain â‰ˆ42% GT-AG dinucleotide pairs in merged data from 54 fibroblast samples. Validation with gqs yields 156,251 gap-sites from TopHat alignments and 166,294 from STAR alignments. Validation with wgis yields 770,327 gap-sites from TopHat alignments and 1,065,596 from STAR alignments. Both alignment algorithms, TopHat and STAR, report gap-sites with considerable false discovery rate, which can drastically be reduced by validation with gqs and wgis.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Wolfgang Kaisers"", ids = ""1832545""); list(name = ""Johannes Ptok"", ids = ""10434572""); list(name = ""Holger Schwender"", ids = ""46356916""); list(name = ""Heiner Schaal"", ids = ""46615357"")",eb1db7923d7bfa266a6e6b8ad59185ac7fc6150a; 6fdf408e4b1796d995db0229a461258349953961; 38ccdf2898d3dad4b34bbceb308bb3f3c736d37f,23268c5cae7a8975a5090cc70a9ae2ec2fc41440; 5ef063030bbfb53a21dfd019cb08b1e9476ede63; 8d9180b74ad8b02d3601853a312a8ff461def3e0; d4006b532fcd6ee2bdbd6e901085825dd91f59ef; 7de8b5ce383f19493ec3b1407115970229885b61; 57a5f14e2f90a153457588b5c989a8468c234b52; 5497b8a80829ee715dea851b11f0371c4afd2f32; dc8391072911b01630a926a834be3d2fd1a5e6d1; c44a67b3c364d2c3699edfbbc41b091fb5bffde8; cfb6521fd1c2c7cd68975a4618fd10c43493f82c; 0f80843d8860d4b3c045e6094c24127b527a9aee; 8daa38c63620c843ab2915ab3e573bf3d957e5dc; 08b67692bc037eada8d3d7ce76cc70994e7c8116; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; 78ce0c149860363bbbe34306c75a4454ad23828d; 5add188f4e7486671f7f1d687fcddd0299b88251; b4da5cc2676b86904a898490fc1c0a86906983d8; 2a0aeff0c49c486f38fa42dcafce60586e94c7bb; 6fca260e9a3c37e246cc15e7639d1a5fa2aed465,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,18,
f298a5d41088ab807d6db06525dcc0cf7c895bb5,Abstract A72: Do prognostic gene signatures exist in Ewing sarcoma? A report from the Children's Oncology Group,"Background & Objectives: Relapse of Ewing sarcoma (ES) can occur months or years after initial remission, and salvage therapy for relapsed disease is usually ineffective. There is great need to develop biomarkers that can predict which patients are at risk for relapse, so that therapy and post-therapy evaluation can be adjusted accordingly. In the current study we sought to identify prognostic gene expression signatures in patients diagnosed with ES. Methods: Specimens were obtained from the Children9s Oncology Group (COG) Biorepository. All samples were prospectively acquired from patients treated on clinical trials INT-0154 and AEWS0031. Criteria for inclusion included confirmation of localized ES, registration on a clinical trial and availability of frozen tumor. Total RNA was processed for whole genome expression profiling using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays. Affymetrix Power Tools (APT) were used to generate normalized gene-level signal intensity estimates from raw CEL file data. Differentially expressed genes with false discovery rate (FDR) of 1.3 were considered to be significantly associated with outcome (survivor vs. non-survivor, relapse vs. no-relapse). Differentially expressed genes were used to create prognostic gene signatures. An independent group of ES samples from the Euro-Ewing tumor Biorepository in Muenster, Germany was similarly analyzed as a validation cohort. Results: Frozen tumor tissue was available from 254 COG patients. Following RNA and sample QC, Affymetrix CEL files were successfully generated from 56 unique patients with localized disease for whom outcome data were available. Analysis of processed gene expression data led to exclusion of 10 cases from further analysis due to issues of batch effect and outlier status. The demographic, event-free (EFS), and overall (OS) characteristics of the remaining 46 cases were shown to be representative of the INT-0154 and AEWS0031 studies as a whole. Unsupervised clustering of transcript-level data failed to demonstrate segregation of the 46 tumors into groups based on relapse or survival status. Supervised analysis of survivors vs. non-survivors identified a small number of differentially expressed genes and several statistically significant gene signatures, but none of these candidate classifiers could be internally validated. Interestingly, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) reproducibly revealed that integrin and chemokine receptor pathways were significantly over-represented as discriminators of EFS and OS (FDR Conclusions: Robust prognostic gene signatures that pass internal and external cross-validation were not identified in this study. These findings demonstrate the profound degree of molecular heterogeneity in ES and suggest that the heterogeneous nature of these tumors is likely to preclude identification of prognostic signatures that will be clinically useful for all cases. Whether prognostic gene signatures will be useful for differentiating among subsets of ES cases is unknown and will require larger cohort analyses. Nevertheless, these studies support recent laboratory-based discoveries implicating cell adhesion and chemokine receptor signaling in ES aggression. Further investigation of these pathways in the context of tumor cell:tumor stroma interactions is warranted. Citation Format: Samuel L. Volchenboum, Jorge Andrade, Donald A.

5c85c7536f756a4b4feba32b787ee28f4bd07d37,Fibrinolysis Treatment for Cerebral Intraventricular Hemorrhage: A Temporal and Spatial Voxel-Based Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE
A voxel-based statistical approach on computer tomographic data in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and acute intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) was used to evaluate spatial and temporal patterns of intraventricular blood in patients treated with intraventricular fibrinolysis (IVF) or without.


METHODS
IVH shapes were systematically assessed three dimensionally in patients with supratentorial ICH at three intervals of time (day of admission, day 4 Â± 1, day 7+). The boundaries of the intraventricular blood clot were delineated on computed tomography (CT) scans using dedicated software. The CT scan and the IVH shape were transferred into stereotaxic space. In a second step, voxel-based statistics on group level were used to correlate the distribution of intraventricular blood with the interval and the treatment group.


RESULTS
Altogether 45 patients, 29 with IVF therapy and 16 without, were eligible to be included into this study. We found significant (false discovery rate [FDR] correction, q < .05) reduction of the intraventricular blood between day of admission and day 7 + for the third and fourth ventricle and parts of both lateral ventricles. In addition, we were able to show a significant difference between the IVF therapy and the conventionally treated group at day 4 Â± 1 for the third ventricle.


CONCLUSIONS
The data indicate that voxel-based analysis on group level can be used to compare the time course and the distribution of intraventricular hemorrhage. This technique could be an interesting tool for future research on ICH with IVH.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Marc Strinitz"", ids = ""1402657639""); list(name = ""Joji B Kuramatsu"", ids = ""5698923""); list(name = ""Iris N Kaschka"", ids = ""5850611""); list(name = ""S Kloska"", ids = ""5147203""); list(name = ""Arnd Doerfler"", ids = ""48042575""); list(name = ""Stefan Schwab"", ids = ""51006699""); list(name = ""Hagen B Huttner"", ids = ""144402929""); list(name = ""Frank Seifert"", ids = ""144224191"")",,b9a12f34d3e6629e6280ec91411e330eb2e430aa; 06c4b98843ebff39c60331617ab64e8767f0a689; ea7bd8634c9889448d4abba9632fdf4aede18f28; 2204b7b5f9a9b325be963e1d21438903ef91a86f; 95952eab6dc8aa166e399b49988d927e5aecbb3d; 89c9a39b892c8ca237b0c06bbfd91abef041a5cd; d79940f77e2dedbb2295e35aa04fa09d2dbc1c9a; cf00c823f3cc7faca417f164572495bea3b70b92; 8cf859444165d0878da16d65632c2af0cf6a4d28; 447d4e922aaf2dd054bd848656f7ae6851dade8e; 7581367ad6593cffbe528ae99f611015684ff97c; 2f5709493f2068c0425adc551a0fcd1c480ef583; 346e62447cba5ede3d8286e670320eafa87d1d49; 6289761ef8f3c812d00ab6e3c7146df27b2b10a3; 883e37906afce0a77a777e1cf14a62a004190f5f; 5542b25bde099f4803a4c0b87d8e8bd7004aa6df; 6eb3339314885a71ac3f5569707c7ac24c356bb2; 3e88ffe88286c48f0da8eed1a81317259841a86e; 44abfaddae2c5d995c6436d58864b143b82e9b12; 3da7c806daf0449ae15bda68ff29a20b70f66e6d; 6a1b51e2bff93461f47e33390161698e2ffb5d93; 6360fabb44ae946c87fd3a6f53015e07d617bfc0; 7adb96cc5fc8faf8c49f015aa69258e1b4089a0f; c14ee30a73261052a9750ae4a1c49b7fa5e9ef1d; 1921038098c7963c3eb9de4db6008dbd55206fef; 011ac116f052f557ddcfb75bbb9545eba4a4e26f; c104df9aabcd2e38345cbf5387b1bb4acc38ccc0; 814869c00d2ea3d3928dbf6cdf08da7834d5711a; 0064d9632c4fc889f281a117fed2104452ecd8bb; 547a2ecf8926a37455c7324065812978db6b0aa0; 1c632a59d46cdd69ff95f1325824cf7bfefdd6b4; 40f4c57037af8acc3c23bd8309645bb57cbe2a17; 10784bf6cccf14682c7dd3a890b7974db73f0690; d6e8e37e4f398a90f93c69984594fc545060bcf6,Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,26 5,"

The aortas were segmented from the CTAs into three-dimensional digital models, which were then subjected to finite-element analysis (FEA) without informing the software (VASCOPS A4clinics Research Edition) about age, gender, family history, or blood pressure. Peak wall rupture index (PWRI), derived from the FEA, was used as a marker of biomechanical rupture risk. Differential gene expression, adjusted for age and gender, was studied with R software. Enriched gene ontology processes were examined for annotated transcripts with the GOrilla and REVIGO online tools. Results: No transcript was significantly associated with PWRI after 5% false discovery rate correction was performed, in either media or adventitia. However, there were 1203 and 872 transcripts associated with PWRI at a nominal P of <.05 in media and adventitia, respectively. Analysis of enriched biological processes using the entire annotated transcript list ranked by fold-change revealed that extracellular matrix and structure organization in the media and nucleic acid metabolism and RNA metabolism in the adventitia were the most enriched biological processes in aneurysms with high PWRI. Conclusions: These results suggest that biomechanical rupture risk associates with expression of extracellular matrix genes as well as the level of bulk gene activity.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""RafaÃ«lle Spear"", ids = ""37524655""); list(name = ""Adrien Hertault"", ids = ""13326380""); list(name = ""Katrien Van Calster"", ids = ""16067756""); list(name = ""Matthieu Delloye"", ids = ""13580361""); list(name = ""Richard Azzaoui"", ids = ""145415590""); list(name = ""Jonathan Sobocinski"", ids = ""5653575""); list(name = ""StÃ©phan Haulon"", ids = ""6181232""); list(name = ""Dominique Fabre"", ids = ""2668572"")",,,Journal of Vascular Surgery,65,202S
e6fed017dbb5d2122bc5bc2638532197fed3b7db,[Evaluation of performance of five bioinformatics software for the prediction of missense mutations].,"OBJECTIVE
To study the prediction performance evaluation with five kinds of bioinformatics software (SIFT, PolyPhen2, MutationTaster, Provean, MutationAssessor).


METHODS
From own database for genetic mutations collected over the past five years, Chinese literature database, Human Gene Mutation Database, and dbSNP, 121 missense mutations confirmed by functional studies, and 121 missense mutations suspected to be pathogenic by pedigree analysis were used as positive gold standard, while 242 missense mutations with minor allele frequency (MAF)>5% in dominant hereditary diseases were used as negative gold standard. The selected mutations were predicted with the five software. Based on the results, the performance of the five software was evaluated for their sensitivity, specificity, positive predict value, false positive rate, negative predict value, false negative rate, false discovery rate, accuracy, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC).


RESULTS
In terms of sensitivity, negative predictive value and false negative rate, the rank was MutationTaster, PolyPhen2, Provean, SIFT, and MutationAssessor. For specificity and false positive rate, the rank was MutationTaster, Provean, MutationAssessor, SIFT, and PolyPhen2. For positive predict value and false discovery rate, the rank was MutationTaster, Provean, MutationAssessor, PolyPhen2, and SIFT. For area under the ROC curve (AUC) and accuracy, the rank was MutationTaster, Provean, PolyPhen2, MutationAssessor, and SIFT.


CONCLUSION
The prediction performance of software may be different when using different parameters. Among the five software, MutationTaster has the best prediction performance.",2016,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qianting Chen"", ids = ""34579069""); list(name = ""Congling Dai"", ids = ""13792258""); list(name = ""Qianjun Zhang"", ids = ""46324790""); list(name = ""Juan Du"", ids = ""49237391""); list(name = ""Wen Li"", ids = ""1702619"")",70f84c2f5c51277d845021a63bdbfd9ffe79a4da,,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,33 5,"

e5b2d672428aebb04e7c657558358b88129cb5d6,Title Improved Detection of Common Variants Associated with Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder Using Pleiotropy-Informed Conditional False Discovery Rate Permalink,"Several lines of evidence suggest that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have the potential to explain more of the â€˜â€˜missing heritabilityâ€™â€™ of common complex phenotypes. However, reliable methods to identify a larger proportion of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that impact disease risk are currently lacking. Here, we use a genetic pleiotropy-informed conditional false discovery rate (FDR) method on GWAS summary statistics data to identify new loci associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorders (BD), two highly heritable disorders with significant missing heritability. Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggest similar disease characteristics and overlapping genes between SCZ and BD. Here, we computed conditional Qâ€“Q curves of data from the Psychiatric Genome Consortium (SCZ; n = 9,379 cases and n = 7,736 controls; BD: n = 6,990 cases and n = 4,820 controls) to show enrichment of SNPs associated with SCZ as a function of association with BD and vice versa with a corresponding reduction in FDR. Applying the conditional FDR method, we identified 58 loci associated with SCZ and 35 loci associated with BD below the conditional FDR level of 0.05. Of these, 14 loci were associated with both SCZ and BD (conjunction FDR). Together, these findings show the feasibility of genetic pleiotropy-informed methods to improve gene discovery in SCZ and BD and indicate overlapping genetic mechanisms between these two disorders.

Here we demonstrate that heterobifunctional cross-linkers, while theoretically different from homobifunctional cross-linkers, need not be considered separately in practice. We develop and then evaluate the impact of applying a correct FDR formula for use of heterobifunctional cross-linkers and conclude that there are minimal practical advantages. Hence a single formula can be applied to data generated from the many different non-cleavable cross-linkers.",2018,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lutz Fischer"", ids = ""46445673""); list(name = ""Juri Rappsilber"", ids = ""2813740"")",,c11a91721633536ebfd291ded2e93df8ff68b588; ca278a4cd769721bb148f9fcc9d6e34446b090e4; e0f54c55beb1195decc4249a1290592ef4832ebd; b6befcbd40dfdf3341ce5dd9e805f1b2a177cde4; 68d5610b0eab933543da3212a074c743c756a0a7; 3f6d5eb9300dab591e58b56926b3d977f51e9eea; 7d86d71f2a2647c79927ba342a3522fc79c10501; 8b3437c411da360033abafb94d0a60afe29b69e6; 452f510d80653be529ffcd2408f2a31df8cb85a0; 63cc4395a6bedbe1abf01b299774de1a22095799; ac5f13d4cf926fa4f985fb209e8bde4e9c622aae; 35b0a607eda9a0a23ee631faced825383222a68e; a3df6588a84ee06fe1c9653040e44eede03edc32; 02e388f6c5e161add62a7a52e75bf042dbddc13a; 36522079e6a659a5ef0d831a873fc6e374028c5d; da10d71fb25f44f5b06bf6f5fdc3497a913b8c36; 1ac5009a4ab3ca6038326294d9cfef65d6eadbba; a36be38df3c552b241c990dc60bcc04ae1ba3826; e4191211368d5a4a637cecba18891014a4338368; a76a3ceb9f1cf558da95c2a11a074b3867c75ed7; f5fe8f9a7154312258bb74ace3440bded1febb9a; 1ffdc25e9aa3eea99dcf13a875f47f26ba42474d; 2debae33e7fe3509d2908cf0d41d83646f824145; 5875fb7b83900f77a6bba7cace18fc7988d03396; 060d90c5c5dbbcdb05fd085c1a77d53d6a8b3515; 72ea65e7b53e3566a655cbeba45044dd526cbe20; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79,PLoS ONE,13,
eed89d802b9e7e8f9fa8358afb057cbb16097fc1,A comprehensive map of the human urinary proteome.,"The study of the human urinary proteome has the potential to offer significant insights into normal physiology as well as disease pathology. The information obtained from such studies could be applied to the diagnosis of various diseases. The high sensitivity, resolution, and mass accuracy of the latest generation of mass spectrometers provides an opportunity to accurately catalog the proteins present in human urine, including those present at low levels. To this end, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of human urinary proteome from healthy individuals using high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry. Importantly, we used the Orbitrap for detecting ions in both MS (resolution 60 000) and MS/MS (resolution 15 000) modes. To increase the depth of our analysis, we characterized both unfractionated as well as lectin-enriched proteins in our experiments. In all, we identified 1,823 proteins with less than 1% false discovery rate, of which 671 proteins have not previously been reported as constituents of human urine. This data set should serve as a comprehensive reference list for future studies aimed at identification and characterization of urinary biomarkers for various diseases.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Arivusudar Marimuthu"", ids = ""2017569""); list(name = ""Robert.

b051689afa6db67723e4c4037db9184dc8a22833,High-Throughput Identification of the Plasma Proteomic Signature of Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"BACKGROUND
The molecular aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] and its two subtypes, ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD], have been carefully investigated at genome and transcriptome levels. Recent advances in high-throughput proteome quantification has enabled comprehensive large-scale plasma proteomics studies of IBD.


METHODS
The study used two cohorts: [1] The CERTIFI-cohort: 42 samples from the CERTIFI trial of anti-TNFÎ±-refractory CD patients; [2] the PROgECT-UNITI-HCs cohort: 46 UC samples of the PROgECT study, 84 CD samples of the UNITI I and UNITI II studies, and 72 healthy controls recruited in Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, USA. The plasma proteome for these two cohorts was quantified using high-throughput platforms.


RESULTS
For the PROgECT-UNITI-HCs cohort, we measured a total of 1310 proteins. Of these, 493 proteins showed different plasma levels in IBD patients to the plasma levels in controls at 10% false discovery rate [FDR], among which 11 proteins had a fold change greater than 2. The proteins upregulated in IBD were associated with immunity functionality, whereas the proteins downregulated in IBD were associated with nutrition and metabolism. The proteomic profiles were very similar between UC and CD. In the CERTIFI cohort, 1014 proteins were measured, and it was found that the plasma protein level had little correlation with the blood or intestine transcriptomes.


CONCLUSIONS
We report the largest proteomics study to date on IBD and controls. A large proportion of plasma proteins are altered in IBD, which provides insights into the disease aetiology and indicates a potential for biomarker discovery.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Antonio F Di Narzo"", ids = ""2704710""); list(name = ""Carrie Brodmerkel"", ids = ""2065856""); list(name = ""Shannon E.

9ebc3b9d9391af2a8847ae829d9dbc5a247b6733,A change-point model for identifying 3â€²UTR switching by next-generation RNA sequencing,"MOTIVATION
Next-generation RNA sequencing offers an opportunity to investigate transcriptome in an unprecedented scale. Recent studies have revealed widespread alternative polyadenylation (polyA) in eukaryotes, leading to various mRNA isoforms differing in their 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR), through which, the stability, localization and translation of mRNA can be regulated. However, very few, if any, methods and tools are available for directly analyzing this special alternative RNA processing event. Conventional methods rely on annotation of polyA sites; yet, such knowledge remains incomplete, and identification of polyA sites is still challenging. The goal of this article is to develop methods for detecting 3'UTR switching without any prior knowledge of polyA annotations.


RESULTS
We propose a change-point model based on a likelihood ratio test for detecting 3'UTR switching. We develop a directional testing procedure for identifying dramatic shortening or lengthening events in 3'UTR, while controlling mixed directional false discovery rate at a nominal level. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to analyze 3'UTR switching directly without relying on any polyA annotations. Simulation studies and applications to two real datasets reveal that our proposed method is powerful, accurate and feasible for the analysis of next-generation RNA sequencing data.


CONCLUSIONS
The proposed method will fill a void among alternative RNA processing analysis tools for transcriptome studies. It can help to obtain additional insights from RNA sequencing data by understanding gene regulation mechanisms through the analysis of 3'UTR switching.

ca698d600fd9c02c3c5526b217753a2d9f4abb34,"Changes in SPECT cerebral blood flow following Japanese style, superficial acupuncture at LI-4 and LI-11 in healthy volunteers.","OBJECTIVES
Japanese style, superficial acupuncture (SA) has been clinically evaluated for its therapeutic benefit, yet the neurophysiologic responses associated with SA remain unclear. This study was performed to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) following SA at LI-4 and LI-11 in healthy volunteers using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Changes in SPECT activity following Japanese style SA were compared to previous reports of SPECT changes following electroacupuncture (EA) at the same acupoints.


DESIGN AND SETTING
Ten (10) healthy volunteers were enrolled for this study. A few days after the baseline brain SPECT, SA was performed at LI-4 and LI-11 for 15 minutes and a second brain perfusion image was acquired for each subject. We used SPM2 to analyze the changes in rCBF after SA through a paired t test. In addition, the differences of rCBF changes between SA and EA were compared using a two-sample t test.


RESULTS
Cerebral blood perfusion significantly increased after SA in the left superior frontal gyrus, left middle cingulum, left insular, right medial orbital frontal gyrus, and right middle cingulum (paired t test, uncorrected pâ€‰<â€‰0.005), while no regions showed a significant decrease. The results comparing poststimulation images between SA and EA demonstrated that the perfusion in the right lingual, both thalamus, left middle temporal gyrus, left insula, and both cerebellum were significantly increased in SA compared with EA (false discovery rate [FDR] corrected pâ€‰<â€‰0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
There were specific increase patterns of rCBF following SA at LI-4 and LI-11, which were similar to those following EA. However, there were significant differences in the decrease pattern of rCBF between SA and EA, which might be due to the difference of the strength of acupuncture stimulation between the two methods. These results may contribute to developing a better strategy to a select stimulation method in acupuncture therapy.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Woo-sang Jung"", ids = ""6790214""); list(name = ""Seong-Uk Park"", ids = ""4895010""); list(name = ""Jung-Mi Park"", ids = ""2008540""); list(name = ""Deog-Yoon Kim"", ids = ""102921005""); list(name = ""Il-Ki Hong"", ids = ""66448099""); list(name = ""Young-sil An"", ids = ""1898094""); list(name = ""Sang-kwan Moon"", ids = ""8373979"")",32d9ed942936f2ac08fe44c30528fef24f43b59c; eb09995f2daea7b91c214ea500e0ece027b96c36; 3c3ca0398826d587606071c5719a63caec69e66d; aea2ed538e38658e94f7d2f3f19207d8ac27ed5f; 90021f37a661a11922c1c5c85440c6e3ace0680a; 9e405b11998a367c0a4d49b876ee3991e68f28a3; 7a165d6420a2b52cd316273fbe9469f3d6ea2029; d352382242e24ced9b2ac79ae84dc3c013223002; 54cb37a45dd862da450d6eb8e618df4d1ce444e6; be84405bc4a4722429927bef03fb75537232addc; 188a5e26fb21553863fd9c0c44ac227e5a3d6877; b500170a841735b859e90a07ca092ea21a008d3a,,Journal of alternative and complementary medicine,17 4,"

73aa8761b5bbf4d532f09d44dbaa37ddb875952c,Slow wave detection in sleeping mice: Comparison of traditional and machine learning methods,"BACKGROUND
During slow-wave sleep the electroencephalographic (EEG) and local field potential (LFP) recordings reveal the presence of large amplitude slow waves. Systematic extraction of individual slow waves is not trivial.


NEW METHOD
In this study, we used the neural network pattern recognition to detect individual slow waves in LFP recorded from mice as well as other commonly used methods that are based on fast frequencies modulation, amplitude, or duration.


RESULTS
The number and quality of events detected as slow waves depended on the chosen method of detection, level of thresholds, or on combination of methods. Each individual method yields some false-positive and false-negative detections. Typically, the fast frequency-method has a higher false discovery rate, but almost no missing waves; amplitude-based method has relatively high false-positive and false-negative rates; duration-based method has low false-negative rates; neural network pattern recognition approach has the lowest false-positive rate among individual methods, often rejecting waves that were falsely detected by other approaches. Combining all 4 detection methods practically eliminated false-positive errors, but a large number of slow waves remained undetected.


CONCLUSIONS
The use of a particular method of slow wave detection needs to be adjusted to the objectives of a given study: to detect all slow waves, but also numerous false positives can be achieved using the fast frequency approach. Neural network pattern recognition method alone can detect slow waves with the lowest false-positive rate, that can be further minimized with the use of combination of other methods.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Olga Bukhtiyarova"", ids = ""51196544""); list(name = ""Sara Soltani"", ids = ""144102899""); list(name = ""Sylvain Chauvette"", ids = ""4529146""); list(name = ""Igor Timofeev"", ids = ""144247380"")",a4bf362c7d92f2d6365e64b6628e5a11a4dbc26c; f73fe51faf7c807ad78c2160bfce68ba359b3475,,Journal of Neuroscience Methods,316,35-45
3599081d760853adfd59336f41223f27e197bc3d,Abstract 3880: Targeting the root of cancer: a data-driven approach for identification of lung cancer stem cell biomarkers,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small group of cancer cells with stem cell-like properties and have been revealed to be the drive force of tumorigenesis, metastasis and drug resistance in many cancers. Current CSC surface biomarkers, such as CD133, CD44 and CD166, have been used to isolate CSC population. However, they are often not specific and unassociated with tumor outcome. Here, we applied a data-driven approach to identify new and functional biomarkers of CSC. We systematically screened for genes whose expressions are statistically correlated with CSC surface biomarkers. Normalized DNA microarray data of 160 cases of squamous carcinoma and 33 cases of adenocarcinoma and 8 cases of normal lung were analyzed for association with CD133, CD44 and CD166 respectively. Multiple hypothesis testing was corrected with the false discovery rate (FDR) less than 1%. We find CD133, CD44 and CD166 each has a different set of statistically associated genes in either adeno or squamous subtypes. Moreover, correlated genes with each of the surface marker are different between adeno and squamous subtypes. Among the highly correlated receptor genes with CD133 in squamous subtype is a hormone receptor of the reproduction regulator oxytocin (OXTR, r=0.4276, p=1.699e-8). We experimentally validated the correlation between OXTR and CD133 in human lung cancer tissues and cell lines. Further with functional assays, we discovered a new role of OXTR in promoting the self-renewal and differentiation of lung CSC. Our study suggests highly heterogeneous molecular features of CSC in different lung cancer types and demonstrates that association studies of CSC surface markers can be applied to identify new CSC biomarkers, which can be potentially used for development of probes for CSC imaging and targeting.

7976c6e57cfdacb30164a876a73a89378c444105,Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach Report No . 47 / 2005 Statistische und Probabilistische Methoden der Modellwahl,"Aim of this conference with more than 50 participants, was to bring together leading researchers from roughly three different scientific communities who work on the same issue, data based model selection. Their different methodological approaches can be roughly classified into (1) Frequentist model selection and testing (2) Statistical learning theory and machine learning (3) Bayesian model selection The key task in model selection is to select a proper mathematical model based on information generated by data and/or by prior knowledge. Proper might mean a model with minimal prediction error, a model which describes the main qualitative data features, such as bumps and modes, or a model of low computational complexity. Mathematical techniques and concepts encountered with this workshop are wide spread, ranging from concentration and oracle inequalities, asymptotic analysis and distribution theory to testing theory, information measures and nonconvex optimization.

Introduction by the Organisers In order to achieve our goal to enhance discussion between these communities, every day the conference was opened by a survey talk. Friday afternoon the conference has been closed by a discussion session. 2612 Oberwolfach Report 47/2005 1. Frequentist model selection and testing Nils Hjort introduced in his talk the fundamental concept of a focused information criterion for model selction, which does not propagate a model per se, rather it reflects the more realistic situation, that specific aspects of a model should drive the model selction process. He adressed various questions related to this, e.g. robustness issues, or how do classical information criteria such as AIC or BIC behave from this perspectice. He gives strong evidenve by various examples that different models may result when focussing on different parameters of primary interest. The issue of testing a model was adressed by various talks, N. Neumeyer used bootstrap techniques applied to residual processes whereas L. GyÃ¶rfyâ€™s criterion is based on the L distance between densities. J. M. Loubes and N. Bissantz were concerned with model selection in inverse problems, i.e. for noisy integral operator equations. J.M. Loubes considers nonlinear operators which are locally linear and investigates convergence rates of penalized M-estimators. N. Bissantz focuses on L distance based model testing and selection methods and discusses various applications in astrophysics. To this end, a general analyisis of numerical and statistical regularisation methods is given. Finally, he constructed uniform confidence bands in deconvolution problems which allow graphically to select a proper model. The problem of deconvolution was also highlighted by J. P Kreiss in the context of time series analysis. Conceptually related to N. Hjorts talk, J.K. Ghosh discussed different roles of different penalties in penalized likelihood model selection rules, making the case that the penalty used should depend on the goal (typically either prediction or selection of the best model) and that it is important to incorporate practical features such as growing model dimension in choosing penalties. L. DÃ¼mbgen was concerned with prediction regions in gaussian shift models. He suggested a solution but also pointed out that adaptive construction of prediction regions via a sequence of nested models is limited in various ways. This is in contrast to adaptive estimation. He discussed a â€™no goâ€™ result on the asymptotic diameter of the confidence ball in the spirit of Li (1989). Other talks included topics on Empirical process techniques for locally stationary processes by Rainer Dahlhaus and Universal principles, approximation and model choice by Patrick Laurie Davies and Local Parametric Methods in Nonparametric Regression by Vladimir Spokoiny. 2. Statistical learning theory and machine learning Research on statistical learning theory and nonparametric classification has also been strongly represented by several attendants who partly or completely focus their research on these topics. Several talks have been given in these fields, offering a nice overview on some of the most active areas of investigation, such as oracle inequalities for penalized model selection, margin-based performance bounds, empirically calibrated penalties, model selection focusing on sparse solutions of corresponding optimization problems, convex aggregation of estimators, as well as Statistische und Probabilistische Methoden der Modellwahl 2613 some closely related issues emerging in density estimation, microarray analysis, etc. Peter Bartlett (UC Berkeley) gave a survey talk on nonparametric classification based on empirical minimization of convex cost functionals, a subject that offers a theoretical framework for many successful classification algorithms, including boosting and support vector machines. Marten Wegkampâ€™s talk (Florida State University) discussed a closely related problem of classification with a reject option. Another survey talk on a closely related subject was delivered by Sara van de Geer (ETH ZÃ¼rich) who showed why empirical process theory and concentration inequalities play a crucial role in model selection problems for classification and nonparametric regression. Similarly to Prof. van de Geer, Vladimir Koltchinskii (Georgia Tech) also considered L1-type penalties that lead to sparse models and derived sharp oracle inequalities. Both Alexandre Tsybakov (University of Paris 7) and Florentina Bunea (Florida State University) considered methods for convex aggregation of certain estimates for regression, and proved close-to-optimal performance bounds. LÃ¡szlÃ³ GyÃ¶rfi (Technical University of Budapest) presented a model selection method and a corresponding L1 performance bound for density estimation when the unknown density is assumed to be in one of an infinite sequence of â€parametricâ€ classes of densities. Andrew Nobel (University of North Carolina) discussed algorithmic and probabilistic problems arising in some problems of data mining that can be modeled as searching for large homogeneous blocks in random matrices. 3. Bayesian model selection In Bayesian model selection and BART, E. George and R. McCulloch gave a survey of the Bayesian approach to model selection, while giving an illustration (BART) that seems to have remarkable predictive properties in function estimation and variable selection. This was followed by Merlise Clyde, giving a talk on Bayesian nonparametric function estimation using overcomplete representations and LÃ©vy random field priors. This focused on the novel notion in Bayesian analysis that simultaneous use of multiple bases for functions (leasing to overcompleteness) can be quite valuable in practice, because it can allow for extremely sparse representations of functions. The final Bayesian talk on Monday was by Christian Robert, on Prior choice and model selection. This highlighted the key issue faced by Bayesians in model choice, namely the choice of the prior distribution. Modern approaches to this issue were reviewed, and a new approach (based on a criterion of â€˜matchingâ€™ between models) was introduced. Later talks included A synthesis and unification of Bayes factors for model selection and hypothesis testing, by Luis Pericchi. This talk discussed the prominent role of training samples (or bootstrapping), in many modern model selection scenarios. Valen Johnson, in A note on the consistency and interpretation of Bayes factors based on test statistics considered the problem of developing easy to use 2614 Oberwolfach Report 47/2005 Bayesian procedures as replacements for standard statistical procedures, such as chi-squared tests, t-tests, etc. He demonstrated how many Bayesian testing problems can be reduced to situations with only a one-dimensional unknown, which lend themselves to graphical description. On the final day, the issue of multiple testing was addressed. This is one of the currently hottest areas of statistical and scientific research, and two talks were presented. M.-J. Bayarri gave a survey talk entitled Multiple testing: the problem and some solutions, which reviewed the connections between â€˜false discovery rate,â€™ Bayesian posterior probabilities, and utility functions common in multiple testing scenarios. P. MÃ¼ller followed with elaborations on the utility side, involving applications to significant problems in bioinformatics and clinical trials. The final session in the workshop consisted of very short talks to give other participants (especially newer researchers) a chance to discuss their interests, and several Bayesian talks were presented. M. Bogdan presented Model selection approach to the problem of locating genes influencing quantitative traits, presenting a very nice generalization of BIC for a genetics problem. Katja Ickstadt presented Comparing classification procedures using misclassification rates, with an interesting application to determining genetic â€˜snips.â€™ Angelika van der Linde spoke on Posterior predictive model choice, discussing a new asymptotic Bayesian approach to model choice, requiring a careful decomposition of entropy. Closing Discussion Session: The workshop ended with a discussion session designed to identify key problems remaining to be addressed, and to identify key ways to bridge the gaps between the communities present at the workshop. The questions â€“ together with short descriptions of the results of the discussion â€“ are below. â€¢ Do we all mean the same thing by the phrase model selection? Is it selection of a statistical model for the data, selection of a prediction function, or some averaged version of either? â€“ Conclusion: If prediction is the identified goal, then the various communities have the same view of model selection. Otherwise, interesting differences exist. â€¢ Are fundamental problems of statistics and m",2006,,"list(name = ""James B.

04bd0e8c17d1d1d78680112d8509e10ac17f3adf,Phenotypic associations of genetic susceptibility loci in systemic lupus erythematosus.,"OBJECTIVE
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a clinically heterogeneous autoimmune disease. A number of genetic loci that increase lupus susceptibility have been established. This study examines if these genetic loci also contribute to the clinical heterogeneity in lupus.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
4001 European-derived, 1547 Hispanic, 1590 African-American and 1191 Asian lupus patients were genotyped for 16 confirmed lupus susceptibility loci. Ancestry informative markers were genotyped to calculate and adjust for admixture. The association between the risk allele in each locus was determined and compared in patients with and without the various clinical manifestations included in the ACR criteria.


RESULTS
Renal disorder was significantly correlated with the lupus risk allele in ITGAM (p=5.0 Ã— 10(-6), OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.35) and in TNFSF4 (p=0.0013, OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.25). Other significant findings include the association between risk alleles in FCGR2A and malar rash (p=0.0031, OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.33), ITGAM and discoid rash (p=0.0020, OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.33), STAT4 and protection from oral ulcers (p=0.0027, OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.96) and IL21 and haematological disorder (p=0.0027, OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.22). All these associations are significant with a false discovery rate of <0.05 and pass the significance threshold using Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.


CONCLUSION
Signifi cant associations were found between clinical manifestations and the FCGR2A, ITGAM, STAT4, TNSF4 and IL21 genes. The findings suggest that genetic profiling might be a useful tool to predict disease manifestations in lupus patients in the future.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Elena SÃ¡nchez"", ids = ""80589737""); list(name = ""Ajay Nadig"", ids = ""9521101""); list(name = ""Bruce C.

bab047cc2e4328d31eae2cef2ce5a1151d686660,A high-confidence human plasma proteome reference set with estimated concentrations in PeptideAtlas.,"Human blood plasma can be obtained relatively noninvasively and contains proteins from most, if not all, tissues of the body. Therefore, an extensive, quantitative catalog of plasma proteins is an important starting point for the discovery of disease biomarkers. In 2005, we showed that different proteomics measurements using different sample preparation and analysis techniques identify significantly different sets of proteins, and that a comprehensive plasma proteome can be compiled only by combining data from many different experiments. Applying advanced computational methods developed for the analysis and integration of very large and diverse data sets generated by tandem MS measurements of tryptic peptides, we have now compiled a high-confidence human plasma proteome reference set with well over twice the identified proteins of previous high-confidence sets. It includes a hierarchy of protein identifications at different levels of redundancy following a clearly defined scheme, which we propose as a standard that can be applied to any proteomics data set to facilitate cross-proteome analyses. Further, to aid in development of blood-based diagnostics using techniques such as selected reaction monitoring, we provide a rough estimate of protein concentrations using spectral counting. We identified 20,433 distinct peptides, from which we inferred a highly nonredundant set of 1929 protein sequences at a false discovery rate of 1%. We have made this resource available via PeptideAtlas, a large, multiorganism, publicly accessible compendium of peptides identified in tandem MS experiments conducted by laboratories around the world.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Terry Farrah"", ids = ""2605051""); list(name = ""Eric W.

f46129d66625691379f4ed524d0087b21ce9b9d9,Characterising cis-regulatory variation in the transcriptome of histologically normal and tumour-derived pancreatic tissues,"Objective To elucidate the genetic architecture of gene expression in pancreatic tissues. Design We performed expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis in histologically normal pancreatic tissue samples (n=95) using RNA sequencing and the corresponding 1000 genomes imputed germline genotypes. Data from pancreatic tumour-derived tissue samples (n=115) from The Cancer Genome Atlas were included for comparison. Results We identified 38â€‰615 cis-eQTLs (in 484 genes) in histologically normal tissues and 39â€‰713 cis-eQTL (in 237 genes) in tumour-derived tissues (false discovery rate <0.1), with the strongest effects seen near transcriptional start sites. Approximately 23% and 42% of genes with significant cis-eQTLs appeared to be specific for tumour-derived and normal-derived tissues, respectively. Significant enrichment of cis-eQTL variants was noted in non-coding regulatory regions, in particular for pancreatic tissues (1.53-fold to 3.12-fold, pâ©½0.0001), indicating tissue-specific functional relevance. A common pancreatic cancer risk locus on 9q34.2 (rs687289) was associated with ABO expression in histologically normal (p=5.8Ã—10âˆ’8) and tumour-derived (p=8.3Ã—10âˆ’5) tissues. The high linkage disequilibrium between this variant and the O blood group generating deletion variant in ABO (exon 6) suggested that nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of the â€˜Oâ€™ mRNA might explain this finding. However, knockdown of crucial NMD regulators did not influence decay of the ABO â€˜Oâ€™ mRNA, indicating that a gene regulatory element influenced by pancreatic cancer risk alleles may underlie the eQTL. Conclusions We have identified cis-eQTLs representing potential functional regulatory variants in the pancreas and generated a rich data set for further studies on gene expression and its regulation in pancreatic tissues.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mingfeng Zhang"", ids = ""38135432""); list(name = ""SÃ¸ren Lykke-Andersen"", ids = ""1398174472""); list(name = ""Bin Zhu"", ids = ""48021074""); list(name = ""Wenming Xiao"", ids = ""50988690""); list(name = ""Jason W.

7f4a583e169662fd646a3aa295b573f890719aad,Regulation of Gene Expression with Thyroid Hormone in Rats with Myocardial Infarction,"INTRODUCTION
The expression of hundreds of genes is altered in response to left ventricular (LV) remodeling following large transmural myocardial infarction (MI). Thyroid hormone (TH) improves LV remodeling and cardiac performance after MI. However, the molecular basis is unknown.


METHODS
MI was produced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in female SD rats. Rats were divided into the following groups: (1) Sham MI, (2) MI, and (3) MI+T4 treatment (T4 pellet 3.3 mg, 60 days release, implanted subcutaneously immediately following MI). Four weeks after surgery, total RNA was isolated from LV non-infarcted areas for microarray analysis using the Illumina RatRef-12 Expression BeadChip Platform.


RESULTS
Signals were detected in 13,188 genes (out of 22,523), of which the expression of 154 genes were decreased and the expression of 200 genes were increased in MI rats compared with Sham MI rats (false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05). Compared to MI rats, T4 treatment decreased expression of 27 genes and increased expression of 28 genes. In particular, 6 genes down-regulated by MI and 12 genes up-regulated by MI were reversed by T4. Most of the 55 genes altered by T4 treatment are in the category of molecular function under binding (24) and biological processes which includes immune system process (9), multi-organism process (5) and biological regulation (19) nonexclusively.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that altered expression of genes for molecular function and biological process may be involved in the beneficial effects of thyroid hormone treatment following MI in rats.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yue-feng Chen"", ids = ""2281440""); list(name = ""James V.

66feb275e0f9531826855cc430ab0c55b8f20fcf,Deletion at 2q14.3 is associated with worse response to TNF-Î± blockers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"BackgroundStructural variations such as copy number variations (CNVs) have a functional impact on various human traits. This study profiled genome-wide CNVs in Korean patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to investigate the efficacy of treatment with TNF-Î± blockers.MethodsA total of 357 Korean patients with RA were examined for the efficacy of TNF-Î± blocker treatment. Disease activity indexes were measured at baseline and 6â€‰months after the treatment. The patients were classified as responders and non-responders based on the change in disease activity indexes according to the EULAR response criteria. CNVs in the same patients were profiled using fluorescence signal intensity data generated by a genome-wide SNP array. The association of CNVs with response to TNF-Î± blockers was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression accounting for genetic background and clinical factors including body mass index, gender, baseline disease activity, TNF-Î± blocker used, and methotrexate treatment.ResultsThe study subjects varied in their responses to TNF-Î± blockers and had 286 common CNVs in autosomes. We identified that the 3.8-kb deletion at 2q14.3 in 5% of the subjects was associated with response to TNF-Î± blockers (1.37â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’â€‰5â€‰â‰¤â€‰Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰4.07â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’â€‰4) at a false discovery rate threshold of 5%. The deletion in the identified CNV was significantly more frequent in the non-responders than in the responders, indicating worse response to TNF-Î± blockers in the deletion carriers. The 3.8-kb deletion at 2q14.3 is located in an intergenic region with the binding sites of two transcription factors, MAFF and MAFK.ConclusionsThis study obtained the CNV landscape of Korean patients with RA and identified the common regional deletion associated with poor response to treatment with TNF-Î± blockers.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ki-Nam Gu"", ids = ""152310602""); list(name = ""So-Young Bang"", ids = ""144743562""); list(name = ""Hye-Soon Lee"", ids = ""66406778""); list(name = ""Youngho Park"", ids = ""1776538""); list(name = ""Ju-yeon Kang"", ids = ""104107255""); list(name = ""Ji-Soong Kim"", ids = ""1590793206""); list(name = ""Bora Nam"", ids = ""8064293""); list(name = ""Hyun-Seung Yoo"", ids = ""152253367""); list(name = ""Jung-Min Shin"", ids = ""152375100""); list(name = ""Yeon-Kyung Lee"", ids = ""1390565553""); list(name = ""Tae-Han Lee"", ids = ""152240968""); list(name = ""Sehwan Chun"", ids = ""117352906""); list(name = ""Soo-Kyung Cho"", ids = ""65916885""); list(name = ""Chan-Bum Choi"", ids = ""80164967""); list(name = ""Yoon-Kyoung Sung"", ids = ""143612352""); list(name = ""Tae-Hwan Kim"", ids = ""87452309""); list(name = ""Jae-Bum Jun"", ids = ""5711322""); list(name = ""Dae Hyun Yoo"", ids = ""65943934""); list(name = ""Kimoom Kim"", ids = ""91920885""); list(name = ""Sang-Cheol Bae"", ids = ""144035142"")",,d98ed061c75a7a0794d6999f7f6714eb38926949; 6985e294b02e3023989be896fd474bf1232ca552; 2c5acd24616f09edf64d37e3293b6154c2e08d1f; cb9be2e1217d8f8ef0ab9dd02eb6ef105dbe598e; d50e1680b8fabe497291e9b2d9ca9056b4aad3f2; 96531c43b5bf6fc2bbfb93d7eac6152005dd957e; ded51820fd9f45611ed1eb9a6b6a5900944a2dd7; 27fa64eb32986c21fd3cef2d40ad050be9454369; 403092770c4695518b79b0d7c2fe1dca895582e5; 9d3a22b070de6352d428b4b820502ce1fff3ce3a; ecb12053f0170939b7f163b8c3e568f98a9ff59c; 6806384cb2a288d9c31ccc0399da2faa9207c26c; a1d63f6934b2067ba4b929198f890297a47edfd2; 3d3c6d36d64b37bd4e0185da2aef6a5d2292404c; e2fb7d05334d962e2d85034efdbeea93eeb67917; ea8db9ef4a0f812a87d1c12e5399b4171b9e6b33; a924e77e5625a041de3cabe8bc81b7667a5a1c61; b61dad7f515c44e3b6f0bc81bff1fc7d7d181811; 03d6a52a36713c1583d52e1e1d4d1f079e0ff9c3; cd661920d64f363851bafd57dabe29287ac262b3; 5077d9c363ad8712b59f5bb1e9c33e5191254074; 5b83886a11ba43c37fea871ff6bff6d3aa620293; be24db2cbb64518ae5d948123d08e4756f2a9828; 06d318b023609d76cef9e847840dc69da77d9186; 0ebcd93870675d78f7668546ce9fb65b5db18794; 6ae1ed4e7609c8d0150151d0d8bcd3447fd9522c; 32e7cc7c04f50796f20280cf3bcff2808ff392b1; 5c9655492101e005cd732ab9d0347c6bab88292e; 631e70b18df6ef2c1aecb96b4b0613565a8d3798; 0af9dcc8b16928c437ac93b03bd2d641fc10ff10,Arthritis Research & Therapy,21,

The reduction of infant protein intake and associated growth velocity is a recommended public health strategy for reducing the risk of childhood obesity. This study tests the hypothesis that infants' growth and protein-rich food (dairy, meat, fish and egg) intake influences childhood body size and composition at 2-3 years of age.


METHODS
Thirty-six children were studied from the Feeding Queensland Babies Study Cohort, which prospectively collected data on infant growth and diet. Body composition was estimated using the deuterium oxide dilution technique at 2-3 years of age.


RESULTS
Fat-free mass index Z score at 2-3 years of age was positively associated with animal protein food (dairy, meat, fish and egg) intake at 12 months of age (r = 0.58, P = 0.002, false discovery rate corrected P value = 0.008) and negatively associated with weight-for-length growth velocity from 6 to 12 months of age (r = -0.75, P = 0.019, false discovery rate corrected P value = 0.038), which in turn was negatively associated with growth velocity from 0 to 6 months of age (r = -0.790, P = 0.007).

However, most algorithms for constructing co-expression networks were developed in the microarray era, before high-throughput sequencingâ€”with its unique statistical propertiesâ€”became the norm for expression measurement. Here we develop Bayesian Relevance Networks, an algorithm that uses Bayesian reasoning about expression levels to account for the differing levels of uncertainty in expression measurements between highly- and lowly-expressed entities, and between samples with different sequencing depths. It combines data from groups of samples (e.g., replicates) to estimate group expression levels and confidence ranges. It then computes uncertainty-moderated estimates of cross-group correlations between entities, and uses permutation testing to assess their statistical significance.

ccc136314c9028bbb2680cfde756c8b5fd830093,Effect of feed supplementation with live yeast on the intestinal transcriptome profile of weaning pigs orally challenged with Escherichia coli F4.,"The ability of live yeasts to modulate pig intestinal cell signals in response to infection with Escherichia coli F4ac (ETEC) has not been studied in-depth. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-4407 (Sc), supplied at different times, on the transcriptome profile of the jejunal mucosa of pigs 24 h after infection with ETEC. In total, 20 piglets selected to be ETEC-susceptible were weaned at 24 days of age (day 0) and allotted by litter to one of following groups: control (CO), CO+colistin (AB), CO+5Ã—1010 colony-forming unit (CFU) Sc/kg feed, from day 0 (PR) and CO+5Ã—1010 CFU Sc/kg feed from day 7 (CM). On day 7, the pigs were orally challenged with ETEC and were slaughtered 24 h later after blood sampling for haptoglobin (Hp) and C-reactive protein (CRP) determination. The jejunal mucosa was sampled (1) for morphometry; (2) for quantification of proliferation, apoptosis and zonula occludens (ZO-1); (3) to carry out the microarray analysis. A functional analysis was carried out using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. The normalized enrichment score (NES) was calculated for each gene set, and statistical significance was defined when the False Discovery Rate % was <25 and P-values of NES were <0.05. The blood concentration of CRP and Hp, and the score for ZO-1 integrity on the jejunal villi did not differ between groups. The intestinal crypts were deeper in the AB (P=0.05) and the yeast groups (P<0.05) than in the CO group. Antibiotic treatment increased the number of mitotic cells in intestinal villi as compared with the control group (P<0.05). The PR group tended to increase the mitotic cells in villi and crypts and tended to reduce the cells in apoptosis as compared with the CM group. The transcriptome profiles of the AB and PR groups were similar. In both groups, the gene sets involved in mitosis and in mitochondria development ranked the highest, whereas in the CO group, the gene sets related to cell junction and anion channels were affected. In the CM group, the gene sets linked to the metabolic process, and transcription ranked the highest; a gene set linked with a negative effect on growth was also affected. In conclusion, the constant supplementation in the feed with the strain of yeast tested was effective in counteracting the detrimental effect of ETEC infection in susceptible pigs limits the early activation of the gene sets related to the impairment of the jejunal mucosa.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Paolo Trevisi"", ids = ""3901719""); list(name = ""Rafael Francesconi Latorre"", ids = ""46551518""); list(name = ""Davide Priori"", ids = ""3852775""); list(name = ""Diana Luise"", ids = ""40117772""); list(name = ""Ivonne Archetti"", ids = ""47565706""); list(name = ""Maurizio Mazzoni"", ids = ""39292219""); list(name = ""Romain D'inca"", ids = ""1400726073""); list(name = ""Paolo Bosi"", ids = ""5414920"")",725bc2c1f2eb86a36f10b8f0b7a15c7f2d6c8641; cc4cba8699fe81e72f1b678d95dc054189e67cab; fc5e15a963932d0f9e70cb0b2da2a35e45586c0a; 370cb244f333ac98fedebc3b9b34af3e559c5c45; 0dbfbb031b6aa08446026c8004df587f47eaf707; da39bbbb95db2407fd1c97323b4ebf7461666cce; 101cc9d9b81ac4f0fe3018db8c6ad573d16e80dd; fa6b3fafeedf308826d58db91499b7c09f172310; 89e7cd068b7ebf50d49f4349fae86f78792de489,,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,11 1,"

70700ae6fc27d366132b6faded7ea666a017f4e3,Empirical Bayes and fiducial effect-size estimation for small numbers of tests,"Estimation of an effect size or other parameter of interest (POI), such as an average of differential abundance levels of metabolites or of the differential expression levels of genes, may be improved by shrinking toward a null-hypothesis value to the extent of a probability that the null hypothesis is true. For example, the local false discovery rate (LFDR) is a null-hypothesis posterior probability that is estimable via empirical Bayes methods without specifying the hyperprior distributions needed for a hierarchical Bayesian approach. We compared the following (estimated) null-hypothesis probabilities as degrees of shrinkage in order to improve POI interval estimates (IEs) and POI point estimates (PEs): a histogram-based estimator (HBE) of the LFDR, a binomial-based estimator of the LFDR, a maximum-likelihood estimator of the LFDR, an expected LFDR (ELFDR), and a fiducial probability (FP). In multiple-hypothesis testing, the ELFDR yields reliable IEs while the HBE gives the best PEs. For single-hypothesis testing, the FP generates an IE that outperforms the confidence interval and generates a PE performing at least as well as the unbiased estimator. We apply these POI estimators to the abundance levels of 20 plasma proteins in women with breast cancer.",2015,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Marta Padilla"", ids = ""143948983""); list(name = ""David R.

26aef20a2b198b1c7f0dbbb742b0df150e2c2f37,Pilot genome-wide association search identifies potential loci for risk of erectile dysfunction in type 1 diabetes using the DCCT/EDIC study cohort.,"PURPOSE
We identified genetic predictors of diabetes associated erectile dysfunction using genome-wide and candidate gene approaches in a cohort of men with type 1 diabetes.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We examined 528 white men with type 1 diabetes, including 125 with erectile dysfunction, from DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial) and its observational followup, the EDIC (Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications) study. Erectile dysfunction was identified from a single International Index of Erectile Function item. A Human1M BeadChip (IlluminaÂ®) was used for genotyping. A total of 867,125 single nucleotide polymorphisms were subjected to analysis. Whole genome and candidate gene approaches were used to test the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms may predispose men with type 1 diabetes to erectile dysfunction. Univariate and multivariate models were used, controlling for age, HbA1c, diabetes duration and prior randomization to intensive or conventional insulin therapy during DCCT. A stratified false discovery rate was used to perform the candidate gene approach.


RESULTS
Two single nucleotide polymorphisms located on chromosome 3 in 1 genomic loci were associated with erectile dysfunction with p <1 Ã— 10(-6), including rs9810233 with p = 7 Ã— 10(-7) and rs1920201 with p = 9 Ã—10(-7). The nearest gene to these 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms is ALCAM. Genetic association results at these loci were similar on univariate and multivariate analysis. No candidate genes met the criteria for statistical significance.


CONCLUSIONS
Two single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs9810233 and rs1920101, which are 25 kb apart, are associated with erectile dysfunction, although they do not meet the standard genome-wide association study significance criterion of p <5 Ã— 10(-8). Other studies with larger sample sizes are required to determine whether ALCAM represents a novel gene in the pathogenesis of diabetes associated erectile dysfunction.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""James M.

80f61ca18b414417cb4455d8bd78df3416dbea93,Cancer outlier differential gene expression detection.,"We study statistical methods to detect cancer genes that are over- or down-expressed in some but not all samples in a disease group. This has proven useful in cancer studies where oncogenes are activated only in a small subset of samples. We propose the outlier robust t-statistic (ORT), which is intuitively motivated from the t-statistic, the most commonly used differential gene expression detection method. Using real and simulation studies, we compare the ORT to the recently proposed cancer outlier profile analysis (Tomlins and others, 2005) and the outlier sum statistic of Tibshirani and Hastie (2006). The proposed method often has more detection power and smaller false discovery rates.

fbb3bf7e917ae928dfcc9461114f3e06c17f0d9c,Unlisted: The Americans Big Data Leaves Behind,"Campaigns, pollsters and political scientists increasingly rely on voter registration lists and consumer files to identify targets for contact, and as sampling frames for surveys. However, a sizable proportion of the U.S. citizen population does not appear on these lists, making them invisible to list-based campaigns and research. Â We examine this population after matching respondents to the face-to-face component of the 2012 American National Election Study to voter and consumer files. We make comparisons on numerous survey items while controlling the overall false discovery rate, to avoid capitalizing on chance. We find that at least 11% of the adult citizenry is unlisted, including 1 in 5 Blacks and Hispanics, but just 8% of Whites. The unlisted are more financially vulnerable and have markedly lower levels of political engagement than the listed and are much less likely to report contact with candidates and campaigns. Yet, the unlisted have coherent policy preferences that tend to the left of listed respondents: they reported favoring Obama over Romney 73-27 and just 14% identify as Republicans. We find that if unregistered and unlisted people voted at comparable rates to registered people with the same level of interest in politics, both the 2000 and 2004 Presidential elections would have been won by Democrats.",2015,Political Science,"list(name = ""Simon Jackman"", ids = ""122667030""); list(name = ""Bradley T.

52afbc1e9c1b16d9365d25ebe7f60bb973282bcb,Asynchronous Online Testing of Multiple Hypotheses,"We consider the problem of asynchronous online testing, aimed at providing control of the false discovery rate (FDR) during a continual stream of data collection and testing, where each test may be a sequential test that can start and stop at arbitrary times. This setting increasingly characterizes real-world applications in science and industry, where teams of researchers across large organizations may conduct tests of hypotheses in a decentralized manner. The overlap in time and space also tends to induce dependencies among test statistics, a challenge for classical methodology, which either assumes (overly optimistically) independence or (overly pessimistically) arbitrary dependence between test statistics. We present a general framework that addresses both of these issues via a unified computational abstraction that we refer to as ""conflict sets."" We show how this framework yields algorithms with formal FDR guarantees under a more intermediate, local notion of dependence. We illustrate these algorithms in simulation experiments, comparing to existing algorithms for online FDR control.",2018,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Tijana Zrnic"", ids = ""7830023""); list(name = ""Aaditya Ramdas"", ids = ""2556942""); list(name = ""Michael I.

20b6671b905e210d1adc0543975b96564e25fe99,Shotgun proteomic analysis of sarcoplasmic reticulum preparations from rabbit skeletal muscle.,"To obtain a comprehensive understanding of proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling, a catalog of proteins from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane fractions of New Zealand white rabbit skeletal muscle was analyzed by an optimized shotgun proteomic method. Light and heavy SR membrane fractions were obtained by nonlinear sucrose gradient centrifugation and separated by 1DE followed by a highly reproducible, automated LC-MS/MS on the hybrid linear ion trap (LTQ) Orbitrap mass spectrometer. By integrating as low as 1% false discovery rate as one of the features for quality control method, 483 proteins were identified from both of the two independent SR preparations. Proteins involved in calcium release unit complex, including ryanodine receptor 1, dihydropyridine receptor, calmodulin, triadin, junctin, and calsequestrin, were all detected, which offered validation for this protein identification method. Rigorous bioinformatics analysis was performed. Protein pI value, molecular weight range, hydrophobicity index, and transmembrane region were calculated using bioinformatics softwares. Eighty-three proteins were classified as hydrophobic proteins and 175 proteins were recognized as membrane proteins. Based on the proteomic analysis results, we found as the first time that not only transverse tubule but also mitochondrion physically connected to SR. The complete mapping of these proteomes may help in the elucidation of the process of excitation-contraction coupling and excitation-metabolism coupling.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhouying Liu"", ids = ""3509374""); list(name = ""Xiangning Du"", ids = ""48504744""); list(name = ""Changcheng Yin"", ids = ""47657227""); list(name = ""Zhenzhan Chang"", ids = ""30153300"")",d52a703b1330cb1cffc27a23e368b40c5fce4733; 173dae6f543a9efc1b3c6a9b0af158c79f2ff430; f4b4f06eaa901edcf14e5e5f84a136e7185c07d6; fc7aca8ac2e2971c91cf9b49ec89016ff1494833; 86ee6029d813382e7a6087de61441464f305c630; 85c269c3a2609bd846ab27afb713a900c808380e; 43c3ea47c299093e5487221cc0cdcfae342f73b3; 131429e16c9ca7c5e0fcd042cfd44c433cdff31d,,Proteomics,13 15,"

Peripheral blood biomarkers are needed to identify and determine the extent of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Current physiologic and radiographic prognostic indicators diagnose IPF too late in the course of disease. We hypothesize that peripheral blood biomarkers will identify disease in its early stages, and facilitate monitoring for disease progression.


METHODS
Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood RNA from 130 IPF patients were collected on Agilent microarrays. Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was utilized to identify genes that were differentially-expressed in samples categorized based on percent predicted D(L)CO and FVC.


MAIN MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS
At 1% FDR, 1428 genes were differentially-expressed in mild IPF (D(L)CO >65%) compared to controls and 2790 transcripts were differentially- expressed in severe IPF (D(L)CO >35%) compared to controls. When categorized by percent predicted D(L)CO, SAM demonstrated 13 differentially-expressed transcripts between mild and severe IPF (< 5% FDR). These include CAMP, CEACAM6, CTSG, DEFA3 and A4, OLFM4, HLTF, PACSIN1, GABBR1, IGHM, and 3 unknown genes. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to determine outliers based on severity of disease, and demonstrated 1 mild case to be clinically misclassified as a severe case of IPF. No differentially-expressed transcripts were identified between mild and severe IPF when categorized by percent predicted FVC.


CONCLUSIONS
These results demonstrate that the peripheral blood transcriptome has the potential to distinguish normal individuals from patients with IPF, as well as extent of disease when samples were classified by percent predicted D(L)CO, but not FVC.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ivana V.

In this article, we study the estimation of the null proportion and FDR for discrete p-values with common support. In the finite sample setting, we propose a novel class of conservative FDR estimators. Furthermore, we show that a broad class of FDR estimators is simultaneously conservative over all support points under some weak dependence condition in the asymptotic setting.

a94a06a6e42c3a0e1d21cf2e265967379eb2b932,A multicentric association study between 39 genes and nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate in a Brazilian population.,"PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to use the TaqMan OpenArray system to evaluate associations between 39 genes and the etiology of nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate (NSCLP) in a Brazilian population.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
This case-control association study was designed with 80.11% statistical power according to logistic regression (GPOWER software). The case group had 182 patients with NSCLP enrolled in the Brazilian Database on Orofacial Clefts. The controls included 355 healthy individuals with no history of oral clefting in the past three generations. All samples were genotyped for 253 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) in 39 genes, including two that had recently been associated with this process. The association analysis was performed using logistic regression and stepwise regression. The results were corrected for multiple testing [Bonferroni correction and False Discovery Rate (FDR)].


RESULTS
Twenty-four SNPs in 16 genes were significantly associated with the etiology of NSCLP, including MSX1, SPRY1, MSX2, PRSS35, TFAP2A, SHH, VAX1, TBX10, WNT11, PAX9, BMP4, JAG2, AXIN2, DVL2, KIF7, and TCBE3. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that 11 genes contributed to 15.5% of the etiology of NSCLP in the sample.


CONCLUSION
This is the first study to associate KIF7 and TCEB3 with the etiology of NSCLP. New technological approaches using the same design should help to identify further etiological susceptibility variants.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""TÃ¢nia K. de Araujo"", ids = ""39702686""); list(name = ""Rodrigo Secolin"", ids = ""4309159""); list(name = ""TÃªmis Maria FÃ©lix"", ids = ""1893008""); list(name = ""Liliane Todeschini de Souza"", ids = ""40359005""); list(name = ""Marshall Ã\215talo Barros Fontes"", ids = ""46990408""); list(name = ""Isabella Lopes MonlleÃ³"", ids = ""6591197""); list(name = ""Josiane de Souza"", ids = ""37904133""); list(name = ""Agnes Cristina Fett-Conte"", ids = ""1398027819""); list(name = ""Erlane M Ribeiro"", ids = ""3413378""); list(name = ""Ana Carolina G Xavier"", ids = ""144507704""); list(name = ""Adriana Augusto de Rezende"", ids = ""51886586""); list(name = ""Milena Simioni"", ids = ""113613791""); list(name = ""Ã‚ndrea Ribeiro-Dos-Santos"", ids = ""1406646023""); list(name = ""Sidney Emanuel Batista dos Santos"", ids = ""144313436""); list(name = ""Vera LÃºcia Gil-da-Silva-Lopes"", ids = ""1398588979"")",1702195c82fa359667d680678ee8eb0689958375; 1f47f8c0c10bd8f8f8acab1f3061596793856c66; b9a46c804bce09c960502a869935bfad54d88b9e; 9ea8a016a057fb150038330f0deaa6d2054b6ff9; 17c39dfe4406e89243b74bfbc1f5650cb0ac1bc7; 8fea221916b003d1ff26f2cfd79cc1fe1235d1d5; 4bae5cd7a20e627b668dd4c945208f17ee47190e; eb14f4ce409d321a81ce6682b2077b5ab2e88f5f; 358928fc5e99ffdcae0f26c053f0d2fffafbe1e0; 4f7a97cf3697392a5b5ffbb878ff934119eb8907; 5678f9f567392f606b45570db8d0f89b61c2f8db; 90dc642eb5b8f7e61aff61091fb782c0f6ec4e53; 6bf7789ebfbd6c6066fc9a97ea11b28d21916a84; 06291720bf2eda35b540bea55a73d8834a50d187,,Journal of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery : official publication of the European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery,44 1,"

fd4b45dcbdca97567ef0b0a085824a5044d884d4,Multidimensional local false discovery rate for microarray studies,"MOTIVATION
The false discovery rate (fdr) is a key tool for statistical assessment of differential expression (DE) in microarray studies. Overall control of the fdr alone, however, is not sufficient to address the problem of genes with small variance, which generally suffer from a disproportionally high rate of false positives. It is desirable to have an fdr-controlling procedure that automatically accounts for gene variability.


METHODS
We generalize the local fdr as a function of multiple statistics, combining a common test statistic for assessing DE with its standard error information. We use a non-parametric mixture model for DE and non-DE genes to describe the observed multi-dimensional statistics, and estimate the distribution for non-DE genes via the permutation method. We demonstrate this fdr2d approach for simulated and real microarray data.


RESULTS
The fdr2d allows objective assessment of DE as a function of gene variability. We also show that the fdr2d performs better than commonly used modified test statistics.

9f397ea67b8995583312f33dc78bdcc7ce649a19,Searching for Gene Sets with Mutually Exclusive Mutations,"Cancer cells evolve through random somatic mutations. ""Beneficial"" mutations which disrupt key pathways (e.g. cell cycle regulation) are subject to natural selection. Multiple mutations may lead to the same ""beneficial"" effect, in which case there is no selective advantage to having more than one of these mutations. Hence we are interested in finding sets of genes whose mutations are approximately mutually exclusive (anti-co-occurring) within the TCGA Pancancer dataset. In principle, finding the best set is NP Hard. Nevertheless, we will show how a new Mutation anti-co-OCcurrence Algorithm (MOCA) provides an effective greedy search and testing algorithm with guaranteed control of the familywise error rate or false discovery rate, by combining some under-appreciated ideas from frequentist hypothesis testing. These ideas include: (a) A novel exact conditional test for the tendency of multiple sets to have a large/small union/intersection, which generalises Fisher's exact test of 2x2 tables. (b) Randomised hypothesis tests for discrete distributions. (c) Stouffer's method for combining p-values. (d) Weighted multiple hypothesis testing. A new approach to setting a-priori weights which generates additional implicit hypothesis tests is suggested, and allows us to preserve almost all statistical power when testing pairs despite introducing a combinatorially large number of additional hypotheses.",2016,Mathematics; Biology,"list(name = ""Paul Ginzberg"", ids = ""2055647""); list(name = ""Federico Giorgi"", ids = ""47867375""); list(name = ""Andrea Califano"", ids = ""144890512"")",,8a75d607955ea9eac90619e727101150bec6356e; 6d7fc69b2668ba7e9ed09797615da6e4cee0fcd1; 3ba9d2bf7c7f7fce1de18cd2590f51bc017d7b59; 4871374a6fec685edcb6a5d7947554237f598210; d55441c6b616c4f1b0cb1530fc3255f0622660d7; 68ef613529748c41e0ed02c8d22fc4fb7f57af5d; d8bb8295156d50eb0fe3ece7f05ecf3a5f7fae95; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; a82d8b13afd0402d324c32a57faf67ae877d03f9; 798cf94f81f27af943615a1c2d5fbd7c7547d35d; 3db2dad1c389b708971378634c5addb99cd084ef; 93fa8440d8f700e8c604dfa7863fc1002b18e5f7; f4201827a7b9249f48eba469e0cb6cd9f61f9f41; ce0f8bc0322df7c1e4a0c4ba45e1314b1a1b0cab; e0d84aec0876b8c45e4a7145139dc0776f1424f6; 4225126bdc2a75577fa6f9ea67d0b4617773c44b; 34d8208de9f28bf9fba4c3389a6940725ce919cd; 837a9faaa7fecbce27ab7d540a3d9ec7ee900d29; 80389daa307d53b5d6bf7a13c25deba21b5a9b39; abd114a31f65faf215116ea7af7ba757792eabe3; f6252ae4d71a1580734b7723c356ecbffee69577; 5b4c9c842aad5c52e5cbb0372c8530583d97aa2b,arXiv: Methodology,,
a9082bbfcc2b4374f4367d47e14ed76d73cf4d70,Optimal Rates of Convergence for Estimating the Null Density and Proportion of Nonnull Effects in Large-Scale Multiple Testing,"An important estimation problem that is closely related to large-scale multiple testing is that of estimating the null density and the proportion of nonnull effects. A few estimators have been introduced in the literature; however, several important problems, including the evaluation of the minimax rate of convergence and the construction of rate-optimal estimators, remain open. In this paper, we consider optimal estimation of the null density and the proportion of nonnull effects. Both minimax lower and upper bounds are derived. The lower bound is established by a two-point testing argument, where at the core is the novel construction of two least favorable marginal densities f 1 and f 2 . The density f 1 is heavy tailed both in the spatial and frequency domains and f 2 is a perturbation of f 1 such that the characteristic functions associated with f 1 and f 2 match each other in low frequencies. The minimax upper bound is obtained by constructing estimators which rely on the empirical characteristic function and Fourier analysis. The estimator is shown to be minimax rate optimal. Compared to existing methods in the literature, the proposed procedure not only provides more precise estimates of the null density and the proportion of the nonnull effects, but also yields more accurate results when used inside some multiple testing procedures which aim at controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR). The procedure is easy to implement and numerical results are given.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""T.

a4d1319f50b5dd94b749805c72797fb901644dc9,Preliminary evidence for the role of HTR2A variants in binge eating in young women.,"We examined the association between 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HTR2A and characteristics of disordered eating, including weight/shape concerns, binge eating (with or without loss of control), and compensatory behaviors (purging and nonpurging). Whether a lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) moderated or mediated this association was also investigated. A sample of 1533 twin women of White descent that were part of the Missouri Adolescent Female Twin Study was used. Data were collected using self-report responses to a semistructured interview. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between weight/shape concerns, binge eating, and compensatory behaviors and SNPs (where carriers of the minor allele were coded as 1). Two SNPs, rs6561333 and rs2296972, showed a protective influence against binge eating, with rs2296972 being significant at a trend level after application of the false discovery rate. The SNP was not associated with MDD nor did MDD moderate its putative relation with binge eating. Pending replication, our analyses provide preliminary evidence for intronic SNPs in HTR2A and their association with binge eating. Given the well-documented role of serotonergic dysfunction in eating psychopathology, this report warrants considerable further study.",2014,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rachel Koren"", ids = ""5222256""); list(name = ""Alexis E.

c054d9bd9e747f1759518e144ff9b1959b676e0a,Discussion of â€˜Gene hunting with hidden Markov model knockoffsâ€™,"We congratulate the authors on this interesting paper that tackles the difficult problem of extending the work of CandÃ¨s et al. (2018) to structured predictors possessing a particular type of dependence. Motivated by the aim of making the knockoff construction applicable to genome-wide association studies, Sesia et al. (2019) propose using a hidden Markov model to generate knockoffs that capture patterns of DNA variation, following the work of Scheet & Stephens (2006). The principle underlying the knockoff method is to generate mock predictors XÌƒ , which should be representative of, and exchangeable with, the true X but, by construction, not linked to the response Y . In order to claim robustness with respect to the conditional model of Y | X , the knockoff principle moves the goal post for false discovery rate-controlling variable selection to that of generating mock XÌƒ . The framework thus strongly hinges on how plausible and computationally feasible it is to generate such XÌƒ for each particular class of problem and predictor structure. Generating faithful patterns of DNA variation has been at the heart of genetic research aimed at devising computer simulation programs to reproduce realistic DNA sequence data under complex demographic patterns and genetic features such as population bottleneck and expansion, natural selection, mutation and recombination (Peng et al., 2015). Ideas derived from the coalescent theory have been used in a series of papers by Stephens and colleagues (Stephens et al., 2001; Stephens & Scheet, 2005) to develop methods that can perform haplotype inference and imputation of missing values in a population of unrelated individuals. Unfortunately, these methods only allowed analysis of short DNA sequences since they were very computationally intensive, especially for large numbers of individuals. A breakthrough came from Scheet & Stephens (2006), who, instead of using the computationally expensive coalescent-based product of approximate conditionals likelihood (Li & Stephens, 2003; Stephens & Scheet, 2005), assumed that haplotypes are generated from a cluster model where each cluster consists of a group of closely related haplotypes and the component membership changes continuously along the genome. However, their work was restricted to estimation of the haplotype phase in a homogeneous population, or with known subpopulations, an important point to which we will return later.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Leonardo Bottolo"", ids = ""3037784""); list(name = ""Sylvia Richardson"", ids = ""50130827"")",,977a61f5b31aef34499caae9da079d79dc1d13a2; 97de476f5d3485f8fe29548ed061355d596f9d81; fa02f9123abacd5ba13d41e937d99c077da8d3f6; 73057b061a0f9a8442966e9f2a113e4743595021; cc838a882b254d37f571c234781cfbad1c15227b; 7335660e55f5537dcb09ca29e689211dacffe40e; 23665ae3af7bb4331417b8eb3a289ea5f70379dc; 4d7f3fa72162064c14f8b882b52cc53357afabdb; 9386ed54aba167a251886ec18e2eb2b36aeecfc6; bdc1bdb0a00d9c635925c3ebd7655aac096ccab3; 4f2b48d49c81233aba44396af5b9848f04ed283d; bf69aed8c59bc7099c6bb429d06e25b88efefd91; 1a6b223b5ee5ac78c81b562c857dddeca8dd171a; 154bec20c6cc8509c352b8435af319fd2a0ae5f9; b29a757741b9ccf9404d7f9bf3531e6d53bf6fcf; 975442cd1c8ae7c251fee585fdf9634ef755afcb; 2d151b8799222495c807ad81cdea8f12e35e4518; b5622ba24a8a2f5ed1e67c5f294476db0423ad35; 386b0d9046097113eed56f86e3ddadadc64e7969; 02cba09c676789e5afae0faeda78cd2ad57a52c5,Biometrika,106,19-22

Inst., San Antonio, TX, USA; x St. Maryâ€™s Univ., San Antonio, TX, USA; kWestern Carolina Univ., Cullowhee, NC, USA Purpose: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and the major cause of activity limitation and physical disability in older people. It is widely believed that OA results from the local mechanical environment of the joint and, particularly, the cartilage, in combination with systemic susceptibility to the disease. Preliminary study of knee OA in the baboon demonstrated that knee OA occurs commonly and naturally in male and female adults and the frequency of OA in older baboons is comparable to that in older humans. The objective of this study was to determine whether the patterns of occurrence of osteoarthritic lesions in the distal femur were related to age and sex. Methods: The right femur was collected from baboons at routine necropsy (Southwest National Primate Research Center/Texas Biomedical Research Institute; cause of death was unrelated to this study). The study sample included 123 males (16.53 5.13 years) and 300 females (18.94 5.95 years). Animals were categorized as young for age 21.7 years (w65 human years), and the remainder were categorized as middle-aged. For each animal, the distal right femur was macroscopically examined following established methods and the presence and location of any existing lesions were graded (1-4, ranging from normal to severe) and recorded on normalized maps of the articular cartilage surface. This process resulted in a total of 423 cartilage defect maps which were examined on a pointwise basis using multinomial logistic regressions to determine whether variation in cartilage grades were related to age, sex or age x sex interaction. The probability of correlation was color coded at each surface point as the statistical p-map of differences for each test variable. Correlation p-maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) method with a false discovery rate of 0.05. Additionally, a statistical trait model, based on a principal component analysis, was used to describe the spatial variation of defect grades by reducing the w490,000 highly correlated variables for each defect map to a set of 422 uncorrelated and independent principal components (e.g. composite defect traits) without loss of information. Two-way unbalanced analyses of variance were used to test the principal component weighting factors for dependence on age, sex, and age x sex. Results: Uncorrected correlation p-maps demonstrated substantial pointwise variation in the strength of correlations between cartilage grade and age, sex, and age x sex (Figure 1). FDR correction of p-values for multiple comparisons yielded a critical p-value of 0.013 for the pmap showing correlation with age, resulting in 26.1% of the tests being significant (primarily those in the medial femoral condyle). After correction, none of the pointwise tests were significant for correlation between grade and sex or age x sex. Of the 422 principal components generated, 65 were significantly dependent on age, 13 on sex, and 21 on age x sex interaction. Conclusions: Statistical p-maps demonstrated significant correlations with age, particularly in the medial femoral condyle; whereas no significant correlations were demonstrated with sex and age x sex after correction for multiple comparisons. However, it appears that statistical trait modeling may offer a promising pathway towards understanding Figure 1. Perlecan Expression as a Function of Bovine Donor Age Figure 2.

0581b7db696a95c0b754fbcb07a53f1b98c6f10b,Detecting Significantly Expressed Genes from Their Time-Course Expression Profiles and Its Validation,"This paper proposes a model-based method for detecting significantly expressed genes from their time-course expression profiles. A gene is considered to be significantly expressed if its time-course expression profile is more likely time-dependent than random. The proposed method describes a time-dependent gene expression profile by a non-zero order autoregressive (AR) model, and a time-independent gene expression profile by a zero order AR model. Akaike information criterion (AIC) is used to compare the models and subsequently determine whether a time-course gene expression profile is time-independent or time-dependent. The performance of the proposed method is investigated on both a synthetic dataset and a biological dataset in terms of the false discovery rate (FDR) and the false non-discovery rate (FNR). The results show that the proposed method is valid for detecting significantly expressed genes from their time-course expression profiles.",2008,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Fang-Xiang Wu"", ids = ""145391153"")",,154f2d912f6a25168744f2ce99ec63c4d7295ac8; 387290646fe1f663c39ad7e545043542e10d97f3; 956d43b30629e6be5e8f2c4edb4cea2404598eff; 0fe61d4c241aac94ac3cec8ed898534183f0f6e3; a11c6af34db514fc4ccec0e54f6bc237b01be6d7; f3ae42a16c0da975e53f73488fc91125119df27d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4abf1c2f0a7c9a38f483ff768c55e666d2c1f0f2; bb2f7e8773a5ee02f6bb9839108b1b25cf153f46; 1ebcd67d3d79107b5d49f99261b992e7c1a7328c; 2d896dcc933ce33f7080f68e7ffb031560cbcdfa,2008 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine,,170-175

The effects of insect meal (whose role as alternative feed ingredient is now well recognized) on gut microbiota and mucin composition have recently been reported in Tenebrio molitor-fed free-range and broiler chickens, but no data are currently available for Hermetia illucens (HI)-fed broilers. The present study evaluated the effects of dietary HI meal inclusion on cecal microbiota and intestinal mucin composition of broiler chickens. A total of 256 male broiler chickens were allotted to 4 dietary treatments (control diet [C] and 5%, 10% and 15% HI meal inclusion, with 8 replicate pens/treatment and 8 birds/pen) and slaughtered at 35â€‰d of age (2 animals/pen, 16 birds/diet). The cecal microbiota assessment by 16S rRNA amplicon based sequencing showed lower alpha diversity in HI15 chickens (Shannon, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and higher beta diversity (Adonis and ANOSIM, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) in birds fed HI diets than C. Furthermore, HI15 birds displayed significant increase of the relative abundance of Proteobacteria phylum (False Discovery Rate [FDR]â€‰<â€‰ 0.05) when compared to HI10. L-Ruminococcus (Ruminococcus from Lachnospiraceae family), Faecalibacterium, Blautia and Clostridium genera were found to be characteristic of HI5 cecal microbiota (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05), while broiler chickens fed HI10 and HI15 diets were characterized (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05) by Lactobacillus and Ruminococcus (HI10) and Bacteroides, Roseburia and Helicobacter genera (HI15). Periodic-acid Schiff, Alcian Blue pHâ€‰2.5 and high iron diamine staining on small and large intestine also demonstrated lower mucin staining intensity in the intestinal villi of HI10 and HI15 birds than C (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Dietary HI meal utilization at low inclusion levels (i.e., 5%) positively influenced either the cecal microbiota or the gut mucin dynamics in terms of selection of potentially beneficial bacteria and increase in villi mucins. However, high inclusion levels (in particular the 15%) may have a negative influence in terms of partial reduction of microbial complexity, reduction of potentially beneficial bacteria, selection of bacteria with mucolytic activity and decrease in villi mucins.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ilaria Biasato"", ids = ""13211668""); list(name = ""Ilario Ferrocino"", ids = ""5367620""); list(name = ""Sihem Dabbou"", ids = ""4115173""); list(name = ""Rocchina Evangelista"", ids = ""143931223""); list(name = ""Francesco Gai"", ids = ""5005864""); list(name = ""Laura Gasco"", ids = ""46434588""); list(name = ""Luca Cocolin"", ids = ""3903603""); list(name = ""Maria Teresa Capucchio"", ids = ""6124219""); list(name = ""Achille Schiavone"", ids = ""143948675"")",,4809c76bb0b6158d99e673c1cc4d838986dbfb1c; c66c5255d46ca9d54f5e5ce379e2d2d7a246ae4c; 4bc8127a776ea19c72d0161c74b463eb864d07de; d62f4dbbc5c8b2fb75592e483fafbafada791ed5; 5d02ff7342011f6926deafee44453938be8f548a; e20344ccff906bafafe5ed56264dfaaabc19593f; 8034ef66d3e86d7c287884afe20b2ba08695bd82; a7fdf0096cc3604f898b15886fd793c56d1f9100; dbf1b707ba331a43b2f913cedd260b75ff6e8abf; 5a0138822d246a95750fc4b122f8540f6bc11717; c6f27d9dec408dab2f49c0d40d4235d58d9dc058; 7aba3a64fc6baaa2b8750d1ccbdb276e2d30c660; 30a9644bdaac6f0ca78e8f0cd6b5a23d37a4d006; 535696fe2e5ea4eb8bcc22a70641d13bdf1a6762; 35161a363eb4002a1c54779fc2aa33fbccb2bf1f; 8b86bc4cbaf76c520cab3ea15bb03d5cab595701; d0aa160c61aec6c512e3662e299f87871047520f; 8e7c0daf6b6601e02e46470fe35f7b2ff6d17086; 7a0cdd91c687d5173f200e20d320eb93ee4feccb; 15951c76782a62230eaf96f9b23a204d91e43e2a; 93f80b15bbebfb414770d564ec519980f9771899; 1c20e47edab71e2f028f3c0b99521b27339354b6; 3eca11e592fe42ab1c7958aec115e337557b5d51; 51eeff9b4ff67e6db40927f76b421ad422090f41; f904b2ce6d3dbbaf4e45d06430766ea06617cf15; 2033072bcbe5655b243700a0a65134e9dc1b58d0; 64cd3b4bcc9014d1d11e31e6ca06188bb9707a8d; 5a0a2f5f18cac535b183c35f839e01c064df9308; ddc01d00ce6fbd39e8345f1e7f351edbf79f292f; 0bcd405bc41e13f4b22fe3b5d8afc1fec6126ae4; af74c17f52e0d3c136d34a80c2a9b9d294383516; f920a4df05f172a9665ae2e2a97b15aee8c470c4; 332bd16f1af653192d7700449f78c094573dc415; a758007af30a242acdd4af2df4ecf7045164ebf6; fd7037d0f0b178b6c798af5bbae3cd7a8d7f6ed6; f6e8fc843695dbcfb12768a9a8fd486c696e89fd; 2ae3e27ffe0f933f039b2a38d81c0afc3bc0a1c6; 70b48fd1a0c3d9fef98600578308e1e033c0c67a; dad7cfa7e88e1732d0424f61b3d935a727e2860c; 476f772d13dfdfcaad59535445a6b67fea0d0ce1; 00c2966d5ace2d03acf15c26ff903b6c141376db; 03186470593d969982b5f3ed828c6c79273d08a1; 4e52b29f0957d64d7fb33e7c1ebbad188b5c3509; 40a0df167930629e4adff5115ddf1ade36262849; bb79d18e209852ca735dd49ffd6884696666f2cb; 9674c3487d16879aaaff5d97f1c93e819eb1dc13; a4cabb01358683c066c324c080aad254d17a60a7; 917e7e325bbbd960c5a57ce69ebcc1509b73c84d; 2e5fce9dafa5777be46b658736ed91a5fa134d87; 33e4df3dc44a86c2005ea153735425577cb05e4b; 72b13a5d72031ceba3407de4843a0a3f2f54bb78; 98541d6aa321e498cd5579016a15cfc81c4b191f; 446c1e4691a380da564a09cceef16dd63cb2f077; 490d7108a426a2d208aa301a1348e7f67692978a; 7e87290f94fa4f117cd7dc56531e936e4de883a0; cfc592ff86c08988f04ecf151cbb2abe9e88b7aa; df3965db16e8c52898b250f2fdb09a5bf22df6df; c427e4fdaa9f115a0f4ee837ffbcb784d0410896; fd4a2744bba3b96c1243b9185589bb7771e3a905; 1f9de5dac0360276862b433984cfedbb6b8b2c5e; 4bd3158e60fd5ebbfafed19e773084d99ac4d254; 6f1f6cb121846ee9645577e5a50c789c4bbe7de1; a6de5f160acacaa1ffa468c67782537fd6ae990f,Journal of Animal Science and Biotechnology,11,
990ad6542abcc1397ad487ec9a1071f3526d5676,Improved Statistical Methods Enable Greater Sensitivity in Rhythm Detection for Genome-Wide Data,"Robust methods for identifying patterns of expression in genome-wide data are important for generating hypotheses regarding gene function. To this end, several analytic methods have been developed for detecting periodic patterns. We improve one such method, JTK_CYCLE, by explicitly calculating the null distribution such that it accounts for multiple hypothesis testing and by including non-sinusoidal reference waveforms. We term this method empirical JTK_CYCLE with asymmetry search, and we compare its performance to JTK_CYCLE with Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg multiple hypothesis testing correction, as well as to five other methods: cyclohedron test, address reduction, stable persistence, ANOVA, and F24. We find that ANOVA, F24, and JTK_CYCLE consistently outperform the other three methods when data are limited and noisy; empirical JTK_CYCLE with asymmetry search gives the greatest sensitivity while controlling for the false discovery rate. Our analysis also provides insight into experimental design and we find that, for a fixed number of samples, better sensitivity and specificity are achieved with higher numbers of replicates than with higher sampling density. Application of the methods to detecting circadian rhythms in a metadataset of microarrays that quantify time-dependent gene expression in whole heads of Drosophila melanogaster reveals annotations that are enriched among genes with highly asymmetric waveforms. These include a wide range of oxidation reduction and metabolic genes, as well as genes with transcripts that have multiple splice forms.",2015,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Alan L.

Assuming that noisy objects are included, we propose a soft clustering method which assigns objects that are significantly different from noise into one of the specified number of clusters by controlling decision errors through multiple testing. The parameters of the Gaussian mixture model are estimated from the EM algorithm. Using the estimated probability density function, we formulated a multiple hypothesis testing for the clustering problem, and the positive false discovery rate (pFDR) is calculated as our decision error.

2810851502a43c5b4fb960778a50ccafd5a30fc3,RankProd: a bioconductor package for detecting differentially expressed genes in meta-analysis,"UNLABELLED
While meta-analysis provides a powerful tool for analyzing microarray experiments by combining data from multiple studies, it presents unique computational challenges. The Bioconductor package RankProd provides a new and intuitive tool for this purpose in detecting differentially expressed genes under two experimental conditions. The package modifies and extends the rank product method proposed by Breitling et al., [(2004) FEBS Lett., 573, 83-92] to integrate multiple microarray studies from different laboratories and/or platforms. It offers several advantages over t-test based methods and accepts pre-processed expression datasets produced from a wide variety of platforms. The significance of the detection is assessed by a non-parametric permutation test, and the associated P-value and false discovery rate (FDR) are included in the output alongside the genes that are detected by user-defined criteria. A visualization plot is provided to view actual expression levels for each gene with estimated significance measurements.

1e3a4f56aae18e6e3021f6d6a7949a0114a0898a,Photosensitivity and type I IFN responses in cutaneous lupus are driven by epidermal-derived interferon kappa,"Objective Skin inflammation and photosensitivity are common in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), yet little is known about the mechanisms that regulate these traits. Here we investigate the role of interferon kappa (IFN-&kgr;) in regulation of type I interferon (IFN) and photosensitive responses and examine its dysregulation in lupus skin. Methods mRNA expression of type I IFN genes was analysed from microarray data of CLE lesions and healthy control skin. Similar expression in cultured primary keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells was analysed via RNA-seq. IFNK knock-out (KO) keratinocytes were generated using CRISPR/Cas9. Keratinocytes stably overexpressing IFN-&kgr; were created via G418 selection of transfected cells. IFN responses were assessed via phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 and qRT-PCR for IFN-regulated genes. Ultraviolet B-mediated apoptosis was analysed via TUNEL staining. In vivo protein expression was assessed via immunofluorescent staining of normal and CLE lesional skin. Results IFNK is one of two type I IFNs significantly increased (1.5-fold change, false discovery rate (FDR) q<0.001) in lesional CLE skin. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that type I IFN responses were enriched (FDR=6.8Ã—10âˆ’04) in keratinocytes not in fibroblast and endothelial cells, and this epithelial-derived IFN-&kgr; is responsible for maintaining baseline type I IFN responses in healthy skin. Increased levels of IFN-&kgr;, such as seen in SLE, amplify and accelerate responsiveness of epithelia to IFN-&agr; and increase keratinocyte sensitivity to UV irradiation. Notably, KO of IFN-&kgr; or inhibition of IFN signalling with baricitinib abrogates UVB-induced apoptosis. Conclusion Collectively, our data identify IFN-&kgr; as a critical IFN in CLE pathology via promotion of enhanced IFN responses and photosensitivity. IFN-&kgr; is a potential novel target for UVB prophylaxis and CLE-directed therapy.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mrinal K Sarkar"", ids = ""47506114""); list(name = ""Grace A Hile"", ids = ""51098469""); list(name = ""Lam C.

1018674a361826d31f3e69f2941160e5ac4ff517,Increased detection of genetic loci associated with risk predictors of osteoporotic fracture using a pleiotropic cFDR method.,"Although GWAS have been successful in identifying some osteoporosis associated loci, the findings explain only a small fraction of the total genetic variance. In this study we use a recently developed novel pleiotropic conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method to identify novel genetic loci associated with two risk traits for osteoporotic fracture (the clinical outcome and end result of osteoporosis), Height (HT) and Femoral Neck (FNK) BMD. The cFDR method allows us to improve the detection of associated variants by incorporating any potentially shared genetic mechanisms between the two associated traits. We analyzed the summary statistics from two GWAS meta-analyses for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with HT and FNK BMD. Using the cFDR method, we show enrichment in the identification of SNPs associated with each trait conditioned on their strength of association with the second trait. The findings revealed 18 SNPs that are associated with both HT and FNK BMD, 4 of which had not previously been reported to play a role in bone health. The novel SNPs located at KIF1B and the intergenic region between FERD3L and TWISTNB are noteworthy as these genes may be associated with processes that are functionally important in bone metabolism. By leveraging GWAS results from related phenotypes we identified several novel loci that may contribute to the proportion of variability explained for each trait, although we cannot speculate about these potential contributions to heritability based on this analysis alone.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jonathan Greenbaum"", ids = ""39598482""); list(name = ""Kehao Wu"", ids = ""12953230""); list(name = ""Lan Zhang"", ids = ""50081738""); list(name = ""Hui Shen"", ids = ""51069670""); list(name = ""Jigang Zhang"", ids = ""47540109""); list(name = ""Hong-Wen Deng"", ids = ""144156424"")",4b53127fc6c5ed861594395b5e77d36951c2bc05; 623339b03161fc536f00498eb5d23e24945d7758; d010b123135aa12be898f5c7995ded84fb5916ad; e62b1f0b9429e01a6f296aaa9df71c443d741303; 4fa5bc252101837bedb2852312672f4be44f407f; d230c217d388d76505766d2c06ce1780cb45aadb; c1c230d99f3002ffcb5ca2d9682d8d820c5d76eb; 74d8e016fedf0d57caeb4656a43c884c944eaef2; 30a132da5ab24430bb4218811e4304d846e7bdd4; 977b26d919d64d86f2a60b10486d20c058369a73; 3ce16d0f7d8ee1437a18ef3a9386a7bdb64c02b6; 65ae34915b43cd7c0030c74a7c2def7b321bed89,,Bone,99,"

3c8b47abe84a48d15ce8767ffda747fecceb4b51,Parity-related molecular signatures and breast cancer subtypes by estrogen receptor status,"IntroductionRelationships of parity with breast cancer risk are complex. Parity is associated with decreased risk of postmenopausal hormone receptorâ€“positive breast tumors, but may increase risk for basal-like breast cancers and early-onset tumors. Characterizing parity-related gene expression patterns in normal breast and breast tumor tissues may improve understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying this complex pattern of risk.MethodsWe developed a parity signature by analyzing microRNA microarray data from 130 reduction mammoplasty (RM) patients (54 nulliparous and 76 parous). This parity signature, together with published parity signatures, was evaluated in gene expression data from 150 paired tumors and adjacent benign breast tissues from the Polish Breast Cancer Study, both overall and by tumor estrogen receptor (ER) status.ResultsWe identified 251 genes significantly upregulated by parity status in RM patients (parous versus nulliparous; false discovery rateâ€‰=â€‰0.008), including genes in immune, inflammation and wound response pathways. This parity signature was significantly enriched in normal and tumor tissues of parous breast cancer patients, specifically in ER-positive tumors.ConclusionsOur data corroborate epidemiologic data, suggesting that the etiology and pathogenesis of breast cancers vary by ER status, which may have implications for developing prevention strategies for these tumors.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Melissa Rotunno"", ids = ""3797310""); list(name = ""Xuezheng Sun"", ids = ""49816449""); list(name = ""Jonine D Figueroa"", ids = ""145917271""); list(name = ""Mark E.

c28c075facb91e896b2deef33abbcc6ded78cdcd,GxE effects of FKBP5 and traumatic life events on PTSD: A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND
Twin studies have demonstrated that both genetic and environmental factors influence risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and there is some evidence supporting the interplay of genes and environment (GxE). Many GxE studies within the PTSD literature have focused on genes implicated in the stress response system, such as FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5). Given inconsistencies across GxE literature as a whole, a meta-analysis to synthesize results is warranted.


METHODS
Studies were identified through PubMed and PsycINFO. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model in the MAc package in R. Heterogeneity of the effect size distribution was examined with Cochran's Q statistic. A Simes procedure was used to test the gene-level GxE effect for FKBP5 interacting with trauma.


RESULTS
A significant gene-level GxE gene effect was demonstrated for FKBP5 when pooled across all four examined variants (rs1360780, rs3800373, rs9296158, rs9470080) when interacting with trauma exposure on PTSD. Significant large GxE effect sizes were also found for each independent variant. There was no evidence for heterogeneity of variance.


LIMITATIONS
Limitations include reduced power for detecting variability across moderators, potential bias due to failure of meta-analyzed studies to account for two-way covariate x gene and covariate x environment influences, and a high false discovery rate that is characteristic of GxE analyses.


CONCLUSIONS
This is the first study to quantify an overall gene-level effect of FKBP5 in a GxE analysis of PTSD, evidence which may be used to address current issues in the FKBP5 GxE literature (e.g., disparate variants, low sample sizes and power), as well as inform follow-up functional research.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sage E Hawn"", ids = ""5257149""); list(name = ""Christina M.

5932417eaf714e2b60cf5d9504d369db780326fa,Video-based monitoring for fMRI of uncontrolled motor tasks,"Functional MRI of recovering stroke patients requires careful behavioural monitoring, particularly when sensorimotor deficits are present (e.g. muscle weakness, muscle co-contraction, as well as delayed initiation, execution, or completion of movement). Characterizing such impairments is necessary to image and interpret the associated neural signals appropriately, and should also encompass other unintended motions that are particularly problematic in stroke patients compared to healthy adults (e.g. task correlated head motion [1]). A system to capture these complex kinematics would help substantially to refine individualized fMRI analysis of stroke patients. Therefore, we have constructed a video-based monitoring system comprising MRI-safe cameras and infrared lighting, and flexible video capture software with synchronization and real-time motion tracking capability. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we present a preliminary experiment involving fMRI of uncontrolled mouth movements, relevant to studies of speech recovery after stroke. Methods Hardware. Two MRI-safe cameras (MRC Systems, Heidelberg, Germany) were used in this experiment (Fig. 1), with good sensitivity in the visible and infrared spectrum. Supplementary lighting was provided by clusters of infrared emitting diodes (IREDs) to enable video capture without interfering with visual stimulus presentation in fMRI experiments, if required. Cameras and lights were mounted directly and flexibly on the inside wall of the scanner bore with a custom plastic swivel mount and adhesive, reclosable fasteners. An optical-TTL convertor synchronized the video capture computer with the scanner's optical triggers. Imaging was performed using a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (Magnetom Tim Trio, revision VB15A, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and its standard 12-channel matrix head coil. After a routine anatomical reference scan, a single 470 s BOLD fMRI time series was acquired using gradient-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) (TR/TE/FA = 2000 ms/30 ms/70o, 64x64 matrix, 200 mm FoV, 28 interleaved slices, 5 mm thick). Software. We designed a user friendly Windows-based video capture software (Fig. 2) to accept multiple simultaneous video streams and to timestamp video frames synchronous with fMRI acquisition (difficult capabilities to achieve with commonly available software). The software can optionally track multiple passive reflective markers in three dimensions, based on open-source components (Open Computer Vision Library 1.0, http://opencvlibrary.sourceforge.net/). Tracking only requires a one-time characterization of each camera and a brief (<1 min.) calibration with the cameras in final tracking configuration. Preliminary tests using two lowquality web cameras yielded a 3D tracking error of 0.9 mm. Task. One healthy young male participant, with ethical approval and informed consent, was asked to open and close his mouth approximately 20 times during fMRI. These movements were self-paced and uncontrolled in duration, a difficult scenario to analyze without monitoring. Analysis. A rater (FT) determined the timing of mouth movements and noted the corresponding fMRI-synchronized timestamps on video playback. The fMRI data were analyzed using AFNI [2]. Preprocessing included correction for physiological effects using RETROICOR, temporal interpolation for slice-time correction, coregistration to correct for head motion, and spatial smoothing with a 5 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Linear regression was performed with a mouth open (1) versus closed (0) boxcar waveform convolved with a gamma function, as well as a third order polynomial and six motion estimate parameters in the baseline model. The resulting statistical t-map was thresholded using a False Discovery Rate method [3] at q=0.0001. Results The participant opened his mouth 17 times. Twelve mouth movements were large/long, and the rest were smaller but still visible. The lighting and camera angle of just one video stream was adequate for analysis in this case. As expected, there was strong activation of sensorimotor-related areas (Fig. 3), including medial frontal (supplementary motor area) and lateral areas of the preand post-central gyri (primary motor and sensory areas). Some cerebellar, insula, and middle frontal activation was also present, which may be linked to planning for motor tasks. Head motion was below 1 mm and artifacts were not obvious, although there was a correlation between the mouth movement waveform and the head motion estimates. Discussion A video capture system has been developed to capture movements during fMRI experiments and to improve fMRI analysis, with assessment of stroke patients in mind. The example given (mouth movement) highlights how time-synchronized video capture has significant potential to characterize brain activity associated with movements that are not specifically prescribed, as may occur in stroke patients. The system's capability to handle simultaneous video streams from multiple viewing angles and to perform motion tracking will aid more detailed analysis of complex movements. For example, an experiment with passive markers to track bulk head motion as well as jaw movements is planned. Other options include assessment of manual reaching, grasping, and tool manipulation. In addition, real-time scan plane correction for head motion is also planned using this relatively inexpensive system. 1. Seto, et al. NeuroImage. 14, 284-297 (2001). â— 2. Cox. Comp. & Biomed.

Despite the amount of data generated from high-throughput experiments, statistical methods are often too simplistic to understand the complexity of gene expression. Specifically, existing methods do not test allele-specific expression (ASE) of a gene as a whole and variation in ASE within a gene across exons separately and simultaneously.ResultsWe propose a generalized linear mixed model to close these gaps, incorporating variations due to genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and biological replicates. To improve reliability of statistical inferences, we assign priors on each effect in the model so that information is shared across genes in the entire genome. We utilize Bayesian model selection to test the hypothesis of ASE for each gene and variations across SNPs within a gene. We apply our method to four tissue types in a bovine study to de novo detect ASE genes in the bovine genome, and uncover intriguing predictions of regulatory ASEs across gene exons and across tissue types. We compared our method to competing approaches through simulation studies that mimicked the real datasets.

112cc719750eb1a48d51c4a670765f52ecb625c3,Semiparametric Bayesian inference for phage display data.,"We discuss inference for a human phage display experiment with three stages. The data are tripeptide counts by tissue and stage. The primary aim of the experiment is to identify ligands that bind with high affinity to a given tissue. We formalize the research question as inference about the monotonicity of mean counts over stages. The inference goal is then to identify a list of peptide-tissue pairs with significant increase over stages. We use a semiparametric Dirichlet process mixture of Poisson model. The posterior distribution under this model allows the desired inference about the monotonicity of mean counts. However, the desired inference summary as a list of peptide-tissue pairs with significant increase involves a massive multiplicity problem. We consider two alternative approaches to address this multiplicity issue. First we propose an approach based on the control of the posterior expected false discovery rate. We notice that the implied solution ignores the relative size of the increase. This motivates a second approach based on a utility function that includes explicit weights for the size of the increase.",2013,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Luis G.

0f39ed6ad6daa6763e7c0c1c20c49db541e85e5f,Two-dimensional target decoy strategy for shotgun proteomics.,"The target-decoy approach to estimating and controlling false discovery rate (FDR) has become a de facto standard in shotgun proteomics, and it has been applied at both the peptide-to-spectrum match (PSM) and protein levels. Current bioinformatics methods control either the PSM- or the protein-level FDR, but not both. In order to obtain the most reliable information from their data, users must employ one method when the number of tandem mass spectra exceeds the number of proteins in the database and another method when the reverse is true. Here we propose a simple variation of the standard target-decoy strategy that estimates and controls PSM and protein FDRs simultaneously, regardless of the relative numbers of spectra and proteins. We demonstrate that even if the final goal is a list of PSMs with a fixed low FDR and not a list of protein identifications, the proposed two-dimensional strategy offers advantages over a pure PSM-level strategy.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Marshall W.

91020663ffe9bbf855c0392ceed1e13eac790015,Regulatory Mrna/Microrna Networks in CD34+ Cells From Primary Myelofibrosis,"Abstract 2854 Molecular mechanisms underlying Philadephia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) pathogenesis were partially unraveled in 2005â€“2006 with the identification of somatic gain-of-function of JAK2 and MPL, after which many other mutated genes were found. Recently, several new molecular pathogenetic mechanisms were identified. Among them, aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression especially seems to add to the molecular complexity of MPNs, as specific miRNA signatures capable of discriminating MPN cells from those of normal donors were previously reported (P. Guglielmelli et al., Exp Hematol, 2007). In order to have a comprehensive picture of miRNA deregulation and its relationship with differential gene expression in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) cells, we obtained coding gene- (GEP) and miRNA expression profiles (miEP) in the same CD34+ sample from 31 healthy donors and 42 PMF patients by means of Affymetrix technology (HG-U219 and miRNA 2.0 arrays). 726 genes were found as differentially expressed (DEG) (fold change contrast Ã¢â€°Â¥2, false discovery rate Ã¢â€°Â¤0.05) (FIG. 1) and further analysis pointed out that several DEG are related to processes involved in PMF progression as megakaryocyte (MK) differentiation, fibrosis and migration. Of interest, we found the upregulation of some putative cancer markers, such as WT1 (K. Inoue et al., Blood, 1994) and ANGPT1 (C.L. Cheng, Br J Cancer, 2011) whose expression has already been associated with poor prognosis in hematological neoplasms and in other malignancies. Among the deregulated transcription factors, we detected several genes involved in CD34+ commitment, and potentially in their transformation, such as NFE-2 (C. LAbbaye et al., J Clin Invest, 1995) and KLF3 (A.P. Funnell, Mol Cell Biol, 2012). As regards miEP, we achieved a list of 74 human miRNAs modulated in PMF (DEM) (fold change contrast Ã¢â€°Â¥1.5, false discovery rate Ã¢â€°Â¤0.05), some of which associated with hematological malignancies or known as oncomirs are upregulated, i.e. hsa-miR-155-5p (S. Jiang, Cancer Res, 2010), miRNAs belonging to the miR-17â€“92 cluster (L. Venturini et al., Blood, 2007), whereas other aberrantly expressed miRNAs have never been described in any hematological context. Next, we performed an in silico integrative analysis (IA) with Ingenuity Pathway analysis software, which combines the computational predicted targets with the gene expression data, in order to construct regulatory networks of the functional human miRNA-target interactions. IA between DEG and DEM disclosed a high number of predicted targets with anti-correlated expression to the trend of their targeting miRNAs. This approach allowed the identification of different networks potentially involved in PMF onset and progression, such as MK differentiation and chromatin remodeling, highlighting the potential contribution of miRNAs to PMF pathogenesis. In particular, the integrative analysis has identified an interaction network involving the oncomirs miR-155-5p and miR-29a-3p (R. M. O9Connel et al, J Exp Med, 2008, Y.C. Han et al, j Exp Med, 2010) and their targets (FIG. 2). In this network the upregulation of miR-155-5p and mir-29a-3p could explain the negative regulation of two tumor suppressor genes, HBP1 and TP53INP1, and of SPTB1, CDC42 and KLF3, whose downregulation is involved in malignant hematopoiesis (L.Yang et al, Blood 2007). This network also shows the upregulation of some miRNAs whose function is unknown in the hematopoietic context as miR-335-5p, with the negative regulation of its predicted targets, NR4A3 and PRDM2, which are described as implicated in myeloproliferation (AM Ramirez-Herrick et al, Blood 2001). The present findings lay the groundwork for functional in vitro validation of selected networks in normal and PMF CD34+ cells by means of DEG/DEM overexpression and silencing experiments; furthermore, expression data will be helpful in order to find a clinical correlation between mRNA/miRNA expression levels and diagnostic/prognostic relevance. In conclusion, GEP and miEP pointed out genes and miRNAs candidate for elucidating some of the pathogenetic features of PMF CD34+ cells, whereas IA uncovered potential regulatory networks in which aberrantly expressed miRNAs and genes interact contributing to the malignant phenotype.

Cutaneous sarcoidosis (CS) skin provides relatively noninvasive access to granulomatous sarcoidosis tissue.


OBJECTIVE
We sought to explore the role of the T-helper (Th)1 and Th17 pathways in sarcoidosis.


METHODS
We used molecular profiling and gene expression analysis to analyze the Th1 and Th17 pathways and other immune-mediated pathways in CS. Molecular profiles were obtained from sarcoidosis skin lesions (lesional skin [LS]), unaffected skin from patients with CS (non-LS), and the skin of healthy control subjects. Whole blood was collected to compare the molecular profile of sarcoidosis skin lesions and whole blood.


RESULTS
Twenty participants were enrolled: 15 with active CS and 5 healthy volunteers. Microarray analyses comparing non-LS and healthy volunteer skin with LS showed several thousand genesÂ differentially expressed (â‰¥2-fold change false discovery rate, P < .01). Targeted selections of genes associated with Th1 and Th17 phenotypes showed a strong Th1 profile of sarcoidosis and expression of interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-23R with limited expression of other Th17 pathway genes. IL-21 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were also dysregulated in skin and whole blood, providing additional evidence for involvement of the IL-12 pathway and potential activation of the Th17 pathway.


LIMITATIONS
Measurements were made at a single point in time and may not identify mechanisms that may be identified in patients followed up longitudinally.

59f2308ecb862dc5ca5df00e6ace850858c5bcae,Detection of seizure-associated high-frequency oscillations above 500Hz,"High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) of up to 500Hz in EEG are considered to have close relation with ictogenesis. We had the unique opportunity to record a seizure in EEG with intracerebral macroelectrodes and a sampling frequency of 10kHz. Considering the notion that faster HFOs are likely more ictogenic, we investigated this ictal EEG data to find if even faster HFOs were present. HFOs were investigated in interictal spikes and seizure activity using time-frequency spectra: t values corresponding to frequencies from 100 to 1000Hz were obtained by comparison to the background and controlled by the false discovery rate (FDR). The seizure had a right hippocampal onset. HFOs up to 800Hz as well as HFOs below 500Hz built up in the hippocampal discharges more at the beginning of the seizure and during the preictal period than in the interictal period. These HFOs were visually confirmed in temporally expanded EEG traces. We demonstrated for the first time the existence of HFOs above 500Hz and up to 800Hz with intracerebral macroelectrodes in an epileptic patient; they occurred primarily in association with the seizure discharge. HFOs above 500Hz possibly reflect facilitation of ictogenic neuronal hypersynchronization.",2010,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Katsuhiro Kobayashi"", ids = ""13031838""); list(name = ""Takashi Agari"", ids = ""5014218""); list(name = ""Makio Oka"", ids = ""3851201""); list(name = ""Harumi Yoshinaga"", ids = ""5607486""); list(name = ""Jean Gotman"", ids = ""2071994"")",d6d06cb742849eb86a33c81d61343c4d23ae4800; d10c470fa419a598251416ecec168a15e82286e1; 725f76e0224aa07cf5e2817bdc6d0b6ff61b29b3; d6043d8fbcdc060971d09c28a99abc5d1e6bbd18; bdc441a118594a4db5010b98665c1be047b156ae; 1072ff2925ab755a9620399ce7df3d19a3ddcaa5; d9f3bfa6196044a93f065cabdc1a8c9bb05b2310; 1ca93592bb692f5aa46aa00c1062c470d7563ed9; 700418c1ede4fdab898e71ba264b412498a40264,,Epilepsy Research,88,139-144

Understanding the molecular differences between the two diseases may aid in the development of hypotheses for differing pathogenesis and ultimately, targets for detection. Aims: To characterize the in silico structural and functional alterations to the Gamma Secretase Complex in documented mutations in Familial Hidradenitis Suppurativa, along with comparison of downstream substrate recognition and cleavage. Methods: In silico analysis of publicly available genomic data, assessment of protein structure and binding affinity using Swiss-model and Dynamut was undertaken. Differential Expression was expressed using Log Fold Change using the general framework for linear models in R. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined by FCH â‰¥1.5 or â‰¤-1.5 and false discovery rate (FDR â‰¤ 0.05). Results: Twenty three of 39 mutations in HS are degraded via nonsense mediated decay with altered substrate and binding affinity of substrates identified in the remaining mutations. Significant differential expression of ErbB4, SCNB1, and Tie1 in lesional skin was specific to Hidradenitis Suppurativa and EphB2, EPHB4, KCNE1, LRP6, MUSK, SDC3, Sortilin1 in blood specific to Familial Alzheimer's Disease. Discussion and Conclusions: We present the first in silico evidence as to the impact of documented mutations in Familial Hidradenitis Suppurativa. We also demonstrate unique substrate recognition and cleavage between Hidradenitis Suppurativa and Familial Alzheimer's Disease, providing a potential explanation as to why the two diseases do not occur within the same pedigree.

5addc3cd63136066b087ea44b03efb845628a637,Genome-wide pathway analysis in pancreatic cancer.,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this study was to identify candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that might play a role in susceptibility to pancreatic cancer, elucidate their potential mechanisms, and generate SNP-to-gene-to-pathway hypotheses.


METHODS
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset of pancreatic cancer that included 496,959 SNPs from 3,851 pancreatic cancer patients and 3,934 control subjects of European descent was used in this study. The Identify candidate Causal SNPs and Pathways (ICSNPathway) method was applied to the GWAS dataset.


RESULTS
ICSNPathway analysis identified 18 candidate SNPs, 11 genes (including HNF1A and HNF4G), and 30 pathways, which revealed 11 hypothetical biological mechanisms. The strongest hypothetical biological mechanism was one wherein rs2230739 alters the role of ADCY9 in various pathways and processes, including cyclase activity, phosphorus oxygen lyase activity, hsa04912, hsa04540, hsa04020, and hsa00230 (0.010 â‰¤ p < 0.001; 0.038 â‰¤ false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤ 0.016). The second strongest mechanism was that rs16859886 modulates ADCY10 to affect its role in pathways including cyclase activity, phosphorus oxygen lyase activity, nucleobase, nucleoside, and nucleotide metabolic processing, and hsa00230 (0.010 â‰¤ p < 0.001; 0.038 â‰¤ FDR â‰¤ 0.016).


CONCLUSIONS
By using the ICSNPathway to analyze pancreatic cancer GWAS data, 18 candidate SNPs, 11 genes (including ADCY9, ADCY10, HNF1A, and HNF4G), and 30 pathways were identified that might contribute to the susceptibility of patients to pancreatic cancer.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Young Ho Lee"", ids = ""1794446""); list(name = ""Gwan Gyu Song"", ids = ""12915342"")",de8bcfa7af8d3b5ed80e93288393247888362f11; fca5baef41d960f9c952945b977dbc2c305cce7e; 4d38cdcec307a22df4ee286a020bf2e08a95273f,6c0ac4c6ee11cb813a9be81ba391abb2c1dcce3b; 5aa273d1db8662b5594ff2dcaeee279187f636b9; 6dfa83e99e853a5a8f4331a14ce35f73b6fa2789; 5e54f0a1bda9c1134c0f64f9ad266b44773a9783; dd3fff43c5658b2dab7ee77380f31c9189f1bda4; 90381d538e5751eaba07a8fa659cfa5fe21b92fd; 334132eec2691a55d85a113dd2094971082b55ee; a55bc18446e4209453c08a8d8ceb2f4a4a3a8977; 681face3b0017800f93a381ef6d1936cba0cc333; cb59554e76f45f344bc60b97a6144dbb4cb0de05; 27d57f0c4e0d6bb9c39de107e12a9d4c977cec3c; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 6d623e92030a13dbd87ad6e99dc83b1e773f4320; 942f9be51d640cea1ffc1aa638722a4f765ca5a6; 0814c5b3b3a5dcdeb730033823147e444b27523a; b7dd3263924508299937c51ace3010b73fe5e61d; bbae8ddc76f301f8396fcaa30607e339229dfbed; 8cc820b547f92a1086a12516bf8206efe6a63769; 0e2520292e03a6fffce2142ef9727e73b6c89ab0; 59abab2c3e458746095e4fcc6a739e515fb6338c; cddf87d75bef4b32bce91c16260bf274fb01d434; 6480039b32988cf83bde873263b09897e14d551e; d5d773b3e0e47e5f395bd75b989f9adf774599e5; ab4055fe719d2910343d21c87e6e27e54e7d1fd9; 791237c0941c5e37ea1fc55255d754f39dfdf282; ec18289446c8d300d3ac1e8dbce8b81baf2ca00a; fa160778d063122496e18dc90a7edb18a56c7775,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,20 6,"

e75017da441c88c8741be4e9778c91b22fcaf8e1,CDH13 promoter SNPs with pleiotropic effect on cardiometabolic parameters represent methylation QTLs,"CDH13 encodes T-cadherin, a receptor for high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin and low-density lipoprotein, promoting proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Genome-wide association studies have mapped multiple variants in CDH13 associated with cardiometabolic traits (CMT) with variable effects across studies. We hypothesized that this heterogeneity might reflect interplay with DNA methylation within the region. Resequencing and EpiTYPERâ„¢ assay were applied for the HYPertension in ESTonia/Coronary Artery Disease in Czech (HYPEST/CADCZ; nÂ =Â 358) samples to identify CDH13 promoter SNPs acting as methylation Quantitative Trait Loci (meQTLs) and to investigate their associations with CMT. In silico data were extracted from genome-wide DNA methylation and genotype datasets of the population-based sample Estonian Genome Center of the University of Tartu (EGCUT; nÂ =Â 165). HYPESTâ€“CADCZ meta-analysis identified a rare variant rs113460564 as highly significant meQTL for a 134-bp distant CpG site (PÂ =Â 5.90Â Ã—Â 10âˆ’6; Î²Â =Â 3.19Â %). Four common SNPs (rs12443878, rs12444338, rs62040565, rs8060301) exhibited effect on methylation level of up to 3 neighboring CpG sites in both datasets. The strongest association was detected in EGCUT between rs8060301 and cg09415485 (false discovery rate corrected P valueÂ =Â 1.89Â Ã—Â 10âˆ’30). Simultaneously, rs8060301 showed association with diastolic blood pressure, serum high-density lipoprotein and HMW adiponectin (PÂ <Â 0.005).

2294424d0a9ec28ab40c80b1d9cb8c088b05820a,Jaccard/Tanimoto similarity test and estimation methods,"Binary data are used in a broad area of biological sciences. Using binary presence-absence data, we can evaluate species co-occurrences that help elucidate relationships among organisms and environments. To summarize similarity between occurrences of species, we routinely use the Jaccard/Tanimoto coefficient, which is the ratio of their intersection to their union. It is natural, then, to identify statistically significant Jaccard/Tanimoto coefficients, which suggest non-random co-occurrences of species. However, statistical hypothesis testing using this similarity coefficient has been seldom used or studied. 
We introduce a hypothesis test for similarity for biological presence-absence data, using the Jaccard/Tanimoto coefficient. Several key improvements are presented including unbiased estimation of expectation and centered Jaccard/Tanimoto coefficients, that account for occurrence probabilities. We derived the exact and asymptotic solutions and developed the bootstrap and measurement concentration algorithms to compute statistical significance of binary similarity. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate that our proposed methods produce accurate p-values and false discovery rates. The proposed estimation methods are orders of magnitude faster than the exact solution. The proposed methods are implemented in an open source R package called jaccard (this https URL=jaccard). 
We introduce a suite of statistical methods for the Jaccard/Tanimoto similarity coefficient, that enable straightforward incorporation of probabilistic measures in analysis for species co-occurrences. Due to their generality, the proposed methods and implementations are applicable to a wide range of binary data arising from genomics, biochemistry, and other areas of science.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Neo Christopher Chung"", ids = ""3219565""); list(name = ""Blazej Miasojedow"", ids = ""40602116""); list(name = ""Michal Startek"", ids = ""2345343""); list(name = ""Anna Gambin"", ids = ""2904414"")",5866284540ac8d6d66ed7d01580e5b8d8b200b6f,,arXiv: Methodology,,
99f3b64a6c909676ba4abdc833fc18c1595ffd00,Linear discriminant analysis-based estimation of the false discovery rate for phosphopeptide identifications.,"The development of liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has made it possible to characterize phosphopeptides in an increasingly large-scale and high-throughput fashion. However, extracting confident phosphopeptide identifications from the resulting large data sets in a similar high-throughput fashion remains difficult, as does rigorously estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) of a set of phosphopeptide identifications. This article describes a data analysis pipeline designed to address these issues. The first step is to reanalyze phosphopeptide identifications that contain ambiguous assignments for the incorporated phosphate(s) to determine the most likely arrangement of the phosphate(s). The next step is to employ an expectation maximization algorithm to estimate the joint distribution of the peptide scores. A linear discriminant analysis is then performed to determine how to optimally combine peptide scores (in this case, from SEQUEST) into a discriminant score that possesses the maximum discriminating power. Based on this discriminant score, the p- and q-values for each phosphopeptide identification are calculated, and the phosphopeptide identification FDR is then estimated. This data analysis approach was applied to data from a study of irradiated human skin fibroblasts to provide a robust estimate of FDR for phosphopeptides.

a197ed4bf481cf24eb2d6823e7d6f8a72ff3f84f,Phosphoproteome analysis of human liver tissue by long-gradient nanoflow LC coupled with multiple stage MS analysis.,"Reversible protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in liver development and function. Comprehensively cataloging the phosphoproteins and their phosphorylation sites in human liver tissue will facilitate the understanding of physiological and pathological mechanisms of liver. Owing to lacking of efficient approach to fractionate phosphopeptides, nanoflow-RPLC with long-gradient elution was applied to reduce the complexity of the phosphopeptides in this study. Two approaches were performed to further improve the coverage of phosphoproteome analysis of human liver tissue. In one approach, ten-replicated long-gradient LC-MS/MS runs were performed to analyze the enriched phosphopeptides, which resulted in the localization of 1080 phosphorylation sites from 495 proteins. In another approach, proteins from liver tissue were first fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then long-gradient LC-MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the phosphopeptides derived from each fraction, which resulted in the localization of 1786 phosphorylation sites from 911 proteins. The two approaches showed the complementation in phosphoproteome analysis of human liver tissue. Combining the results of the two approaches, identification of 2225 nonredundant phosphorylation sites from 1023 proteins was obtained. The confidence of phosphopeptide identifications was strictly controlled with false discovery rate (FDR) < or = 1% by a MS(2)/MS(3) target-decoy database search approach. Among the localized 2225 phosphorylated sites, as many as 70.07% (1559 phosphorylated sites) were also reported by others, which confirmed the high confidence of the sites determined in this study. Considering the data acquired from low accuracy mass spectrometer and processed by a conservative MS(2)/MS(3) target-decoy approach, the number of localized phosphorylation sites obtained for human liver tissue in this study is quite impressive.",2010,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Guanghui Han"", ids = ""47530607""); list(name = ""Mingliang Ye"", ids = ""143803401""); list(name = ""Hongwei Liu"", ids = ""49957802""); list(name = ""Chunxia Song"", ids = ""3367314""); list(name = ""Deguang Sun"", ids = ""6985808""); list(name = ""YiFeng Wu"", ids = ""50118328""); list(name = ""Xinning Jiang"", ids = ""2702237""); list(name = ""Rui Chen"", ids = ""144313211""); list(name = ""Chunli Wang"", ids = ""145442944""); list(name = ""Liming Wang"", ids = ""39386487""); list(name = ""Hanfa Zou"", ids = ""144215899"")",c5bffca209607f6eb012460bba73bed95707a4ec; 90b23077a0061c98244767d21eb55abff6ecde17; 79e34c7fc88db2801e3c4a5c61df70146081838c; 1b59f1430ce4ca5545ee7365dec71c585542ef1f; 13b3e0b71910baf5e9718a1b4c647828e09e82de; eb8b047b782a92cbd314717158fe4002a8f4ea42; 4aab0e01e319b704370204ec97904f94df5994ee; e71f9460a00026c20a04abcf15aa2b8e107e1bd1; 5995b0fed5b15cf6b2a7aafa194f3b67e87ed422; d73ebe287652067d21d3162898dbc854d77f7ebb; 1e4a67547db70b286ad2ce1ab2af3d1a27de25cd; bb02dbf0d1b92d89f3463d3fc7e38e2f6eb0f79b; 9bd6665a453c050f70309fff7f50808ace0be857; 2d1f87a5a7029ac179a09d49ea651d69802a8167; 80874f88f9c49e15b8c20cfb8cc8ed5af8162b76; c50cf6205c8de5d987d72da8880b044e9368cd0d; 896141dd202a3021a1c0ab44f9d628ca3e386556; fdcb06fca320b44cf1d82d53fd5242db06feea65; a6b7943fef8d06ffef7125eb9dead1e45488a640; 33d5916b0495c5e0011b27a54674f34554eb1638; afe7ed7617c34a72dcd21d78e1cd179184b65d7a; b75c3e03569722b17ee0480a400707e2a14d4a40; f02c3ed496769cd144b9c66193b94619267e645d; 53266f09596cbfd5827964cb1a0d6e09e3bf9aa3; 90789fdbea7555e588afc3ac77f72d8941f71cbd; 0aceb39f53db5a675a0e6660eea6f3550183a8dd; 6ced155813010a14b49db97d72fd3955981c226a; af1e0851f4facd8495f6c63df21578bc4b65437d; 7bba81ef1944a44fdb0db6e1f0b3a556c8e4f988; f2cabb044bbd0a1175e724395f9e1eb095bc1291; e7b5136d28f85e155b774670c681a2cf6a9baf4e; 6ca7c47c289c8f7d346557e4e9298f053c6b1bdd; 48f480de7473fe5a3a57d4c0597432b5d568bc44; fa28e7929016103d177426c1d3d84403d3e11451; 1623da80a0f5a42f9df51eb35750eaf5af9158f3; 30fe78283c52f03b6e729563799153421fddbaf4; 609c8e5a7865a9f4aa99d573ba01156adfc0b5be; a55719022469f3dadbbd97b6adb8d46f280884f8; 4d55a895d2f0f3bde16ceab6de3682f891e80c65; a7345d938e9699898ae350f9e9295b71d5ba5157; 70c99a6f40734504d1dfc53657e2e3651da8e6de; e15b5fa7f8185d4ee33ee2b36290a8f78b59e1c7; 7f5fada6471c692f08b89a37728caab24a942c8b; 15ef3b446740d07d6549a7334dea57311b901b9f,,Electrophoresis,31 6,"

Clinical chorioamnionitis represents the maternal syndrome often associated with intra-amniotic infection, although other causes of this syndrome have been recently described. The objective of this study was to characterize the umbilical cord plasma cytokine profile in neonates born to mothers with clinical chorioamnionitis at term, according to the presence or absence of bacteria and/or intra-amniotic inflammation. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted, including patients with clinical chorioamnionitis at term (n=38; cases) and those with spontaneous term labor without clinical chorioamnionitis (n=77; controls). Women with clinical chorioamnionitis were classified according to the results of amniotic fluid culture, broad-range polymerase chain reaction coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) and amniotic fluid interleukin (IL)-6 concentration into three groups: 1) no intra-amniotic inflammation; 2) intra-amniotic inflammation without detectable microorganisms; or 3) microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation. A fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) was defined as an umbilical cord plasma IL-6 concentration >11 pg/mL. The umbilical cord plasma concentrations of 29 cytokines were determined with sensitive and specific V-PLEX immunoassays. Nonparametric statistical methods were used for analysis, adjusting for a false discovery rate of 5%. Results: 1) Neonates born to mothers with clinical chorioamnionitis at term (considered in toto) had significantly higher median umbilical cord plasma concentrations of IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-16, IL-13, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-8, but significantly lower interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-Î± concentrations than neonates born to mothers with spontaneous term labor without clinical chorioamnionitis; 2) neonates born to mothers with clinical chorioamnionitis at term but without intra-amniotic inflammation had higher concentrations of IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-8, but lower IFN-Î³, than neonates not exposed to clinical chorioamnionitis, suggesting that maternal fever in the absence of intra-amniotic inflammation leads to a change in the fetal cytokine network; 3) there were significant, positive correlations between maternal and umbilical cord plasma IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations (IL-6: Spearman correlation=0.53; P<0.001; IL-8: Spearman correlation=0.42; P<0.001), consistent with placental transfer of cytokines; 4) an elevated fetal plasma IL-6 (>11 pg/mL), the diagnostic criterion for FIRS, was present in 21% of cases (8/38), and all these neonates were born to mothers with proven intra-amniotic infection; and 5) FIRS was associated with a high concentration of umbilical cord plasma IL-8, IL-10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. Conclusions: Neonates born to mothers with clinical chorioamnionitis at term had higher concentrations of umbilical cord plasma cytokines than those born to mothers without clinical chorioamnionitis. Even neonates exposed to clinical chorioamnionitis but not to intra-amniotic inflammation had elevated concentrations of multiple cytokines, suggesting that intrapartum fever alters the fetal immune response.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Roberto Romero"", ids = ""145783429""); list(name = ""Piya Chaemsaithong"", ids = ""6809143""); list(name = ""Nikolina Docheva"", ids = ""5482810""); list(name = ""Steven J.

d56d4829f6d3196df2e6512a349c67e23473ee07,Integrating Genome-Wide Association Studies With Pathway Analysis and Gene Expression Analysis Highlights Novel Osteoarthritis Risk Pathways and Genes,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disorder worldwide. To identify more genetic signals, genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been widely used and elucidated some OA susceptibility genes. However, these susceptibility genes could only explain only a small part of heritability of OA. It is suggested that the identification of disease-related pathways may contribute to understand the genomic etiology of OA. Here, we integrated the GWAS into pathway analysis to identify novel OA risk pathways. In this study, we first selected 187 independent genetic variants identified by GWAS (P < 1.00E-05) and found that most of these genetic variants are noncoding mutations. We then conducted an expression quantitative trait loci analysis and found that 165 of these 187 genetic variants could significantly regulate the expression of nearby genes. Third, we identified OA susceptibility genes corresponding to these genetic variants, conducted a pathway analysis, and identified novel OA-related KEGG pathways, GO biological processes, GO molecular functions, and GO cellular components. In KEGG database, transforming growth factor Î² signaling pathway is the most significant signal (P = 5.98E-05) and is the only pathway after the BH multiple-test adjustment with false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.02. In GO database, we identified 24 statistically significant GO biological processes, one statistically significant GO molecular function, and five statistically significant GO cellular components (FDR < 0.05). These signals are related with chondrocyte differentiation and development, which are all known biological pathways associated with OA. Finally, we conducted an OA case-control gene expression analysis to evaluate the differential expression of these OA risk genes. Using an OA case-control gene expression analysis, we showed that 44 risk genes were suggestively differentially expressed in OA cases compared with controls (P < 0.05). Three genes, WWP2, COG5, and MAPT, were statistically differentially expressed in OA cases compared with controls (P < 0.05/122 = 4.10E-04).

Materials and Methodsâ€‚The present study recruited 69 post-RT NPC patients without conventional cardiovascular risk factors, 70 type 2 diabetic patients without previous RT, and 76 healthy controls without conventional cardiovascular risk factors and previous RT. For each participant, 5 carotid atherosclerotic parameters, namely carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), carotid arterial stiffness (CAS), presence of carotid plaque, carotid plaque score, and presence of â‰¥â€Š50â€Š% carotid stenosis, were assessed using ultrasonography. The differences in these carotid atherosclerotic parameters between study groups were compared using ANCOVA or logistic regression after the adjustment for age and gender. Multiple comparisons were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate. Resultsâ€‚Post-RT NPC patients and type 2 diabetics had a significantly higher CIMT, CAS and carotid plaque burden compared to the healthy subjects (corrected P-value, Pcor <â€Š0.05). In addition, carotid atherosclerosis in post-RT NPC patients tended to be more severe with significantly higher CAS and carotid plaque burden than that in type 2 diabetics (Pcor <â€Š0.05). Conclusionâ€‚Neck RT for NPC is an independent risk factor of carotid atherosclerosis, and radiation induces more severe carotid atherosclerosis in post-RT NPC patients. Thus, assessment of carotid atherosclerosis using ultrasonography may be necessary for these patients and should be indicated in the routine follow-up of NPC.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chuang Yuan"", ids = ""4940196""); list(name = ""Vincent Wc Wu"", ids = ""47252904""); list(name = ""Shea Ping Yip"", ids = ""3314137""); list(name = ""Dora L.W.

Perhaps the most popular error rate used for avoiding type one error inflation is the false discovery rate (FDR). However, most theoretical and software development for FDR control has focused on the case of continuous test statistics. For discrete data, methods that provide proven FDR control and good performance have been proposed only recently. The R package DiscreteFDR provides an implementation of these methods. For particular commonly used discrete tests such as Fisher's exact test, it can be applied as an off-the-shelf tool by taking only the raw data as input. It can also be used for any arbitrary discrete test statistics by using some additional information on the distribution of these statistics. The paper reviews the statistical methods in a non-technical way, provides a detailed description of the implementation in DiscreteFDR and presents some sample code and analyses.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Guillermo AndrÃ©s Durand"", ids = ""77212328""); list(name = ""Florian Junge"", ids = ""2643752""); list(name = ""Sebastian Dohler"", ids = ""90848108""); list(name = ""Etienne Roquain"", ids = ""3117456"")",4d442f793573153f93e2901617b97ca90098be5a,86de357a916fe87958eae60243242ae17395f66d; 05b0d71e861f971e6c6d25af4fb908e0f0c174fe; d2af3c5b1f34a440baa5974e0546bc8201897fda; 09f3572aba38c4268720c60fe14d63033bef1956; 875f1c09dd2a5430f4427f6d400e4907c0764413; 218a431fe7633a6dbaaef1f3de1aa2ea0b46ec88; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 6d16661a2571066ab13789d781cb10351ae333f5; 9911d691cf8f9e7086dcace703a6559da89b3682; 858ebcba255653003d19f6a1b2a6935e9ec78c3d; 622aac02e6f11c70455d517946ced2d9032e5359; 263d3e0869a0abf2c45fc00737c790237410f51f; c4465436014be9baae12aeee01880ff4c9571e8a; a03270a32ee34fe08214d696fda472601a80a449; e9328fb2408e6aeebf802f673a6bee9a881266cf; 473aed5ddabee5daec75829b8e0e430da4e53019,arXiv: Computation,,
e83fbc52548f927837444dc7716ae0590f8bb9ae,CircCode: A Powerful Tool for Identifying circRNA Coding Ability,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which play vital roles in many regulatory pathways, are widespread in many species. Although many circRNAs have been discovered in plants and animals, the functions of these RNAs have not been fully investigated. In addition to the function of circRNAs as microRNA (miRNA) decoys, the translation potential of circRNAs is important for the study of their functions; yet, few tools are available to identify their translation potential. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technology and the emergence of ribosome profiling technology, it is possible to identify the coding ability of circRNAs with high sensitivity. To evaluate the coding ability of circRNAs, we first developed the CircCode tool and then used CircCode to investigate the translation potential of circRNAs from humans and Arabidopsis thaliana. Based on the ribosome profile databases downloaded from NCBI, we found 3,610 and 1,569 translated circRNAs in humans and A. thaliana, respectively. Finally, we tested the performance of CircCode and found a low false discovery rate and high sensitivity for identifying circRNA coding ability. CircCode, a Python 3-based framework for identifying the coding ability of circRNAs, is also a simple and powerful command line-based tool. To investigate the translation potential of circRNAs, the user can simply fill in the given configuration file and run the Python 3 scripts.

In this study, we conducted genome-wide association studies to identify chromosomal regions associated with recombination rates. We analyzed genotype data collected on the pedigrees in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics on Alcoholism data provided by Genetic Analysis Workshop 14. A total of 315 microsatellites and 10,081 single-nucleotide polymorphisms from Affymetrix on 22 autosomal chromosomes were used in our association analysis. Genome-wide gender-specific recombination counts for family founders were inferred first and association analysis was performed using multiple linear regressions. We used the positive false discovery rate (pFDR) to account for multiple comparisons in the two genome-wide scans. Eight regions showed some evidence of association with recombination counts based on the single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis after adjusting for multiple comparisons. However, no region was found to be significant using microsatellites.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Song Huang"", ids = ""47156556""); list(name = ""Shuang Wang"", ids = ""39888986""); list(name = ""Nianjun Liu"", ids = ""40111761""); list(name = ""Liang Chen"", ids = ""30534560""); list(name = ""Cheongeun Oh"", ids = ""3683670""); list(name = ""Hongyu Zhao"", ids = ""145400502"")",,0efd63ecb2d9f6c7bac14890e8f2974bcc2517e6; 0a1f99556725a04eee23fdc1daa735809ed146a8; 533b51b38474a3d88a39920f9bf42f2b120d8729; 21d213205f02fa4c83c9b450e08e0a9120e47c1a; f360b56a76a7f9aa3e1e8c8274543923719b8167; 11df6f3e7aeb60d281f41ff384ae237e50d94c71; b6c384f2f6087eacfdebd87fc4a27db454940940; 6e7b9daed31c8d6788e4deef11d7634818c206b2; 99dfbc1a35e1cbfe13233ec69fddef72c8205053; 50b5a50ea0f0b363e862d8dbde5f834ed9288ae0; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; ffc64335d3573d185b8557bc567cbcf608f76b9e,BMC Genetics,6,S51 - S51

The Korean native pig (KNP) is a regional breed in Korea that was characterized by relatively high intramuscular fat content and reddish meat color compared to other western breeds such as Yorkshire (YS). YS grew faster and contained more lean muscle than KNP. We compared the KNP to Yorksire to find molecular clues determining muscle characteristics. The comparison of skeletal gene expression profiles between these two breeds showed molecular differences in muscle. We found 82 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) defined by fold change (more than 1.5 fold difference) and statistical significance (within 5% of false discovery rate). Functional analyses of these DEGs indicated up-regulation of most genes involved in cell cycle arrest, down-regulation of most genes involved in cellular differentiation and its inhibition, down-regulation of most genes encoding component of muscular-structural system, and up-regulation of most genes involved in diverse metabolism in KNP. Especially, DEGs in above-mentioned categories included a large number of genes encoding proteins directly or indirectly involved in p53 pathway.

fb0e989aab17d7bbade2b2d657b3eb0f1814969b,Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Depression Symptom Severities Are Differentially Associated With Hippocampal Subfield Volume Loss in Combat Veterans,"Background Two decades of human neuroimaging research have associated volume reductions in the hippocampus with posttraumatic stress disorder. However, little is known about the distribution of volume loss across hippocampal subfields. Recent advances in neuroimaging methods have made it possible to accurately delineate 10 gray matter hippocampal subfields. Here, we apply a volumetric analysis of hippocampal subfields to data from a group of combat-exposed Veterans. Method Veterans (total, nâ€‰=â€‰68, posttraumatic stress disorder, nâ€‰=â€‰36; combat control, nâ€‰=â€‰32) completed high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging. Based on previously validated methods, hippocampal subfield volume measurements were conducted using FreeSurfer 6.0. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale assessed posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity; Beck Depression Inventory assessed depressive symptom severity. Controlling for age and intracranial volume, partial correlation analysis examined the relationship between hippocampal subfields and symptom severity. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using false discovery rate. Gender, intelligence, combat severity, comorbid anxiety, alcohol/substance use disorder, and medication status were investigated as potential confounds. Results In the whole sample, total hippocampal volume negatively correlated with Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and Beck Depression Inventory scores. Of the 10 hippocampal subfields, Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale symptom severity negatively correlated with the hippocampusâ€“amygdala transition area (HATA). Beck Depression Inventory scores negatively correlated with dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis 4 (CA4), HATA, CA2/3, molecular layer, and CA1. Follow-up analysis limited to the posttraumatic stress disorder group showed a negative correlation between Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale symptom severity and each of HATA, CA2/3, molecular layer, and CA4. Conclusion This study provides the first evidence relating posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms to abnormalities in the HATA, an anterior hippocampal region highly connected to prefrontal-amygdala circuitry. Notably, dentate gyrus abnormalities were associated with depression severity but not posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Future confirmatory studies should determine the extent to which dentate gyrus volume can differentiate between posttraumatic stress disorder- and depression-related pathophysiology.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Christopher L.

b6365243d52d8d4e43071b45b524eea37eb9eaf8,Estimating the Number of Genes That Are Differentially Expressed in Both of Two Independent Experiments,"A common procedure for estimating the number of genes that are differentially expressed (DE) in two experiments involves two steps. In the first step, data from the two experiments are separately analyzed to produce a list of genes declared to be DE in each experiment. Usually, each list is produced using a method that attempts to control the false discovery rate (FDR) in each experiment at some desired level Î±. In the second step, the number of genes common to both lists is used as an estimate of the number of genes DE in both experiments. AÂ problem with this approach is that the resulting estimates can vary greatly with Î±, and the value of Î± that produces the best estimate for any given pair of experiments is difficult to predict. We propose a method that uses the p-values from both experiments simultaneously to produce one estimateâ€”which does not depend on FDR level Î±â€”for the number of genes that are DE in both experiments. We use two simulation studies (one involving independent, normally distributed data and one involving microarray data) to compare the performances of our proposed method, the commonly used method, and another method proposed in literature to test for consistency of replicate experiments. The results of the simulation studies demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

Direct analysis of protein N-glycosylation by tandem mass spectrometry of glycopeptides promises site-specific elucidation of N-glycan microheterogeneity, something that detached N-glycan and deglycosylated peptide analyses cannot provide. However, successful implementation of direct N-glycopeptide analysis by tandem mass spectrometry remains a challenge. In this work, we consider algorithmic techniques for the analysis of LC-MS/MS data acquired from glycopeptide-enriched fractions of enzymatic digests of purified proteins. We implement a computational strategy that takes advantage of the properties of CID fragmentation spectra of N-glycopeptides, matching the MS/MS spectra to peptide-glycan pairs from protein sequences and glycan structure databases. Significantly, we also propose a novel false discovery rate estimation technique to estimate and manage the number of false identifications. We use a human glycoprotein standard, haptoglobin, digested with trypsin and GluC, enriched for glycopeptides using HILIC chromatography, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS to demonstrate our algorithmic strategy and evaluate its performance. Our software, GlycoPeptideSearch (GPS), assigned glycopeptide identifications to 246 of the spectra at a false discovery rate of 5.58%, identifying 42 distinct haptoglobin peptide-glycan pairs at each of the four haptoglobin N-linked glycosylation sites. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by analyzing plasma-derived haptoglobin, identifying 136 N-linked glycopeptide spectra at a false discovery rate of 0.4%, representing 15 distinct glycopeptides on at least three of the four N-linked glycosylation sites.

The aim of this study was to assess the variation in AgNP-induced lung inflammation and toxicity across multiple inbred mouse strains and to use genome-wide association (GWA) mapping to identify potential candidate susceptibility genes. Mice received doses of 0.25 mg/kg of either 20-nm citrate-coated AgNPs or citrate buffer using oropharyngeal aspiration. Neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) served as markers of inflammation. We found significant strain- and treatment-dependent variation in neutrophils in BALF. GWA mapping identified 10 significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (false discovery rate, 15%) in 4 quantitative trait loci on mouse chromosomes 1, 4, 15, and 18, and Nedd4l (neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated gene 4-like; chromosome 18), Ano6 (anocatmin 6; chromosome 15), and Rnf220 (Ring finger protein 220; chromosome 4) were considered candidate genes. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed significant inverse associations between mRNA levels of these genes and neutrophil influx. Nedd4l, Ano6, and Rnf220 are candidate susceptibility genes for AgNP-induced lung inflammation that warrant additional exploration in future studies.-Scoville, D.

fa33380a74549b4e0e58728745246f96138d4f54,Effect of APOE 4 on Partial Volume-Corrected Diffusion Anisotropy in Patients with AD and MCI Â® â€²â€²,"Introduction: Alzheimer disease (AD) results in changes in cognitive function and cerebral structure, especially in the cortical association areas and the limbic system. In the very early stage of dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a high risk condition for the development of clinically probable AD. Recently, some reports have shown the potential of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) as a useful diagnostic tool in AD and MCI (1). General reduction of fraction anisotropy (FA) and increase in trace values was found in several regions including the parietal and temporal lobes which were mostly involved in AD (2). Those DTI studies were evaluated in DTI indices without considering brain atrophy changes. Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is a genetic risk factor for development of cognitive impairment and dementia. Despite of their potential importance, understanding of microstructural brain change associated with this genetic variation influences remains incomplete. The purpose of our study was to prospectively evaluate whether carriers of APOE4 were altered in brain diffusion anisotropy compared with noncarriers in AD, MCI, and cognitively normal (CN) subjects. For this investigation, we applied a partial volume correction (PVC) method of cerebrospinal fluid on FA and trace maps to test voxel-based comparisons between the carriers and noncarriers for each subject group. Materials and Methods: 25 AD (4 men/21 women; mean age, 70.9 years; MMSE (Mini Mental State Examination Score), 17.2; APOE4, 11 noncarriers/14 carriers), 25 amnestic MCI (12/13; 67.6 years; 26.8; 20/5) and 25 CN subjects (9/16; 68.4 years; 27.3; 20/5) were enrolled in this study. There was no significant difference of demographic characteristics among groups except MMSE. For DTI data, a single-shot spin-echo echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence was used with TR/TE=5700/78ms; SENSE factor 2.5; matrix=112 x 109; voxel=2.2 Ã— 2.2 Ã— 2.2 mm; b=0 and 800sec/mm applied along 32 diffusion-encoding directions using 3T MRI system (Philips, Achieva) equipped with an 8-channel head coil. In addition, a three-dimensional T1-weighted imaging (3D T1WI, i.e. MPRAGE) sequence was run to segment brain tissues and coregister into a standard brain template. T2-weighted and FLAIR images were also acquired to check anatomical abnormalities. The DTI index maps (FA and trace) for each subject were obtained with DTIstudioV2 software (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA). Further imaging processing steps were performed with using Statistical Parametric Mapping program version 5 (SPM5, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). Especially in the PVC step, we use following equation; corrected FA (cFA) =FA*(GM+WM) and corrected Trace (cTrace)=Trace*(GM+WM), where GM and WM are gray matter and white matter fractions obtained from the segmented 3D T1WI. In the statistical analysis, the two-sample ttest was used to compare cFA or cTrace between carriers and noncarriers for each group with covarying for subjectâ€™s age and gender. In addition, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare cFA or cTrace among groups with covarying for subjectâ€™s age and gender. The false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% was used with a threshold. Results : 1) Comparisons between carriers and noncarriers for each group (Fig 1): For cFA in CN subjects, cFA in carriers reduced mainly in the left medial frontal gyrus and WM as compared with noncarriers. In MCI subjects, cFA in carriers decreased in the left precentral gyrus, WM and left posterior cingulate. cFA in carriers increased in the left corpus callosum. Finally, in AD subjects, cFA in carriers significantly decreased in the right inferior frontal gyrus, right cingulate gyrus and left lingual gyrus as well as WM. cFA in carriers increased in the right superior parietal lobule, left precuneus and left cingulate gyrus as well as WM. For cTrace in CN subjects, cTrace value in carriers was not significantly increased, but significantly decreased compared with noncarriers. In MCI subjects, cTrace value in carriers was increased in the left middle frontal gyrus. In AD subjects, cTrace value in carriers was significantly increased in the left lingual gyrus and right thalamus, but decreased in mainly frontal and temporal lobes compared with noncarriers. 2) Comparisons cFA and cTrace between groups (Fig 2): cFA in CN increased in the both frontal and right parietal lobe as compared with MCI and in MCI increased in the both parietal lobes. cFA in CN increased in the both frontotemporoparietal lobes as compared with AD and in AD increased in the both parietal lobes as compared with CN. cFA in MCI increased in the both temporoparietal lobes as compared with AD and in AD increased in the right parietal lobes. cTrace in CN increased in the right parietal cortex as compared with MCI. cTrace in AD increased in the mainly both temporoparietal lobes as compared with CN. cTrace in AD increased in the mainly both parietal lobes as compared with MCI. Discussions: This paper is the first application of the PVC method in analyzing DTI indices in AD and MCI subjects. In addition, there is limited study in investigating DTI data on concerning the effect of the APOE genotype in AD and MCI subjects. The main finding of this study was significant changes of cFA and cTrace values in specific brain regions in APOE4 carriers as compared with noncarriers. Those changes are different as compared data without considering the partial volume correction. It is suggested that non-corrected trace values may reflect brain atrophy rather than actual tissue changes in brain parenchyma. On the microstructural level, intravoxel partial voluming would be higher in elderly subjects compared with young subjects, resulting in higher trace and reflecting age-related increased in interstitial fluid. Many previous studies demonstrated the importance of PVC in brain perfusion with using gray matter tissue (3).We suggested that applications of the PVC in analyzing DTI data in cognitive decline patients should be helpful to evaluate microstructural changes in brain. Conclusion: Regional microstructural changes of brain in APOE4 carriers of AD and MCI subjects were confirmed by using the PVC method of DTI data for the first time. The result of this study demonstrated that the partial volume correction of cerebrospinal fluid in DTI data is very important for accurate evaluation of microstructural changes in cognitive decline patients.

9971aeb7124f7673e79db98bdc07dd5bdb9a41be,Differential expression of microRNAs in human parathyroid carcinomas compared with normal parathyroid tissue.,"Parathyroid carcinoma (PaC) is a rare cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. Though the loss of the oncosuppressor CDC73/HRPT2 gene product, parafibromin, has been involved in the hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome and in a consistent set of sporadic PaCs, parathyroid carcinogenesis remains obscure. MicroRNAs are a new class of small, non-coding RNAs implicated in development of cancer, since their deregulation can induce aberrant expression of several target genes. The aim of the present study was to identify differentially expressed microRNAs in parathyroid cancers compared with normal tissues. We performed a TaqMan low-density array profiling of four parathyroid cancers harboring CDC73 inactivating mutations and negative for parafibromin immunostaining. Their microRNA profiling was compared with that of two normal parathyroid biopsies. Out of 362 human microRNAs assayed, 279 (77%) were successfully amplified. Fourteen and three microRNAs were significantly down- and over-expressed in parathyroid cancers respectively. Of these, miR-296 and miR-139 were down-regulated, and miR-503 and miR-222 were over-expressed with a null false discovery rate. Carcinomas could be discriminated from parathyroid adenomas by a computed score based on the expression levels of miR-296, miR-222, and miR-503 as miR-139 was similarly down-regulated in both cancers and adenomas. Finally, miR-296 and miR-222 levels negatively correlated with mRNA levels of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate and p27/kip1 levels respectively. These results suggest the existence of an altered microRNA expression pattern in PaCs together with a potential role of miR-296 as novel oncosuppressor gene in these neoplasia.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sabrina Corbetta"", ids = ""34597964"");

9eb44ae21342e83fd6724821bf0970bd7f83bf59,Genetic variants of PTPN2 are associated with lung cancer risk: a re-analysis of eight GWASs in the TRICL-ILCCO consortium,"The T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) pathway consists of signaling events mediated by TCPTP. Mutations and genetic variants of some genes in the TCPTP pathway are associated with lung cancer risk and survival. In the present study, we first investigated associations of 5,162 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 43 genes of this TCPTP pathway with lung cancer risk by using summary data of six published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 12,160 cases and 16,838 controls. We identified 11 independent SNPs in eight genes after correction for multiple comparisons by a false discovery rate <0.20. Then, we performed in silico functional analyses for these 11 SNPs by eQTL analysis, two of which, PTPN2 SNPs rs2847297 and rs2847282, were chosen as tagSNPs. We further included two additional GWAS datasets of Harvard University (984 cases and 970 controls) and deCODE (1,319 cases and 26,380 controls), and the overall effects of these two SNPs among all eight GWAS studies remained significant (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.95, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.92â€“0.98, and Pâ€‰=â€‰0.004 for rs2847297; ORâ€‰=â€‰0.95, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.92â€“0.99, and Pâ€‰=â€‰0.009 for rs2847282). In conclusion, the PTPN2 rs2847297 and rs2847282 may be potential susceptible loci for lung cancer risk.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yun Feng"", ids = ""144325322""); list(name = ""Yanru Wang"", ids = ""2604876""); list(name = ""Hongliang Liu"", ids = ""39298101""); list(name = ""Zhensheng Liu"", ids = ""9071783""); list(name = ""Coleman Mills"", ids = ""48571971""); list(name = ""Younghun Han"", ids = ""1871056""); list(name = ""Rayjean J.

536c3cf7d4fdc818611909df68fa50943d56879c,Copy Number Variation detection from 1000 Genomes project exon capture sequencing data,"BackgroundDNA capture technologies combined with high-throughput sequencing now enable cost-effective, deep-coverage, targeted sequencing of complete exomes. This is well suited for SNP discovery and genotyping. However there has been little attention devoted to Copy Number Variation (CNV) detection from exome capture datasets despite the potentially high impact of CNVs in exonic regions on protein function.ResultsAs members of the 1000 Genomes Project analysis effort, we investigated 697 samples in which 931 genes were targeted and sampled with 454 or Illumina paired-end sequencing. We developed a rigorous Bayesian method to detect CNVs in the genes, based on read depth within target regions. Despite substantial variability in read coverage across samples and targeted exons, we were able to identify 107 heterozygous deletions in the dataset. The experimentally determined false discovery rate (FDR) of the cleanest dataset from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute is 12.5%. We were able to substantially improve the FDR in a subset of gene deletion candidates that were adjacent to another gene deletion call (17 calls). The estimated sensitivity of our call-set was 45%.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that exonic sequencing datasets, collected both in population based and medical sequencing projects, will be a useful substrate for detecting genic CNV events, particularly deletions. Based on the number of events we found and the sensitivity of the methods in the present dataset, we estimate on average 16 genic heterozygous deletions per individual genome. Our power analysis informs ongoing and future projects about sequencing depth and uniformity of read coverage required for efficient detection.",2012,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jiantao Wu"", ids = ""2199908""); list(name = ""Krzysztof R.

To control the false discovery rate (FDR) of the searching results, the target-decoy method generates and searches a decoy database together with the target database. A known problem is that the target protein sequence database may contain numerous repeated peptides. The structures of these repeats are not preserved by most existing decoy generation algorithms. Previous studies suggest that such discrepancy between the target and decoy databases may lead to an inaccurate FDR estimation. Based on the de Bruijn graph model, we propose a new repeat-preserving algorithm to generate decoy databases. We prove that this algorithm preserves the structures of the repeats in the target database to a great extent. The de Bruijn method has been compared with a few other commonly used methods and demonstrated superior FDR estimation accuracy and improved number of peptide identification.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Johra Muhammad Moosa"", ids = ""2891139""); list(name = ""Shenheng Guan"", ids = ""48733708""); list(name = ""Michael F Moran"", ids = ""4500682""); list(name = ""Bin Ma"", ids = ""1742970"")",9e6d532e21998a169a88b4e013a839cd30894d42,,Journal of proteome research,,

Proper classification threshold is specified to effectively control the false discovery rate, and the result is validated by searching predicted interactions in related databases as well as projecting them to signaling pathways to mark up key factors in disease mechanism.

Remarkably, p53 has been suggested to be transcriptionally inactive in these cells. To gain insight in the kinetics and interplay of the predominant transcriptional responses of DNA damage signalling pathways in undifferentiated cells, mouse embryonic stem cells were exposed to cisplatin at four different time points (2, 4, 8 and 24h) and concentrations (1, 2, 5 and 10 microM). RNA was isolated and subjected to genome-wide expression profiling. Up to one fourth of the tested genes could be identified as being differentially expressed (false discovery rate=10%) after the cisplatin treatment. Clustering of the expression changes showed a strong time dependency. To investigate the relationship between affected genes, a gene set analysis method was used. Functionally related gene sets were defined using gene ontologies or transcription factor binding sites and were tested for overrepresentation within the differentially expressed genes. A variety of gene sets were clearly enriched among which 'apoptosis' and 'cell cycle' were the most pronounced. Furthermore, there was a strong enrichment of genes with a p53-binding motif. The involvement of the 'cell cycle' and 'apoptosis' gene sets in the cisplatin response was detected at concentrations and time points where the respective biological assays were still negative. The results reveal novel insights into the mechanisms which maintain the genomic integrity in undifferentiated cells. Additionally the results illustrate that gene set analysis of genome-wide expression changes provides a sensitive instrument to detect cellular stress responses to DNA damage.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jacqueline J.

03f6b4ee44a0e6d20f7858fa687aca9cd9e5292e,Genetic architecture of regulatory variation in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Studying the genetic regulation of expression variation is a key method to dissect complex phenotypic traits. To examine the genetic architecture of regulatory variation in Arabidopsis thaliana, we performed genome-wide association (GWA) mapping of gene expression in an F(1) hybrid diversity panel. At a genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.2, an associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) explains >38% of trait variation. In comparison with SNPs that are distant from the genes to which they were associated, locally associated SNPs are preferentially found in regions with extended linkage disequilibrium (LD) and have distinct population frequencies of the derived alleles (where Arabidopsis lyrata has the ancestral allele), suggesting that different selective forces are acting. Locally associated SNPs tend to have additive inheritance, whereas distantly associated SNPs are primarily dominant. In contrast to results from mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in linkage studies, we observe extensive allelic heterogeneity for local regulatory loci in our diversity panel. By association mapping of allele-specific expression (ASE), we detect a significant enrichment for cis-acting variation in local regulatory variation. In addition to gene expression variation, association mapping of splicing variation reveals both local and distant genetic regulation for intron and exon level traits. Finally, we identify candidate genes for 59 diverse phenotypic traits that were mapped to eQTL.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xu Sunny Zhang"", ids = ""46447215""); list(name = ""Andrew J Cal"", ids = ""5296393""); list(name = ""Justin O.

5010b14de80110043dfa3e0c92ca305b0193e318,Differential DNA methylation analysis of breast cancer reveals the impact of immune signaling in radiation therapy,"Radiotherapy (RT) is a central treatment modality for breast cancer patients. The purpose of our study was to investigate the DNA methylation changes in tumors following RT, and to identify epigenetic markers predicting treatment outcome. Paired biopsies from patients with inoperable breast cancer were collected both before irradiation (n = 20) and after receiving 10-24 Gray (Gy) (n = 19). DNA methylation analysis was performed by using Illumina Infinium 27K arrays. Fourteen genes were selected for technical validation by pyrosequencing. Eighty-two differentially methylated genes were identified in irradiated (n = 11) versus nonirradiated (n = 19) samples (false discovery rate, FDR = 1.1%). Methylation levels in pathways belonging to the immune system were most altered after RT. Based on methylation levels before irradiation, a panel of five genes (H2AFY, CTSA, LTC4S, IL5RA and RB1) were significantly associated with clinical response (p = 0.041). Furthermore, the degree of methylation changes for 2,516 probes correlated with the given radiation dose. Within the 2,516 probes, an enrichment for pathways involved in cellular immune response, proliferation and apoptosis was identified (FDR < 5%). Here, we observed clear differences in methylation levels induced by radiation, some associated with response to treatment. Our study adds knowledge on the molecular mechanisms behind radiation response.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ann Rita Halvorsen"", ids = ""34883903""); list(name = ""Ã…slaug Helland"", ids = ""2016245""); list(name = ""Thomas Fleischer"", ids = ""5287253""); list(name = ""K.

89ae12a5ce4bd9dcf12438a6c631aa7b3aac08b6,Genomic regions influencing coat color saturation and facial markings in Fleckvieh cattle.,"Genomic regions associated with coat color and pigmented areas of the head were identified for Fleckvieh (dual-purpose Simmental), a red-spotted and white-headed cattle breed. Coat color was measured with a chromameter, implementing the CIELAB color space and resulting in numerical representation of lightness, color intensity, red/green and blue/yellow color components, rather than subjective classification. Single marker regression analyses with fixed effects of the sex and barn were applied, and significant regions were determined with the local false discovery rate methodology.

3dc00e8ea82ebcf07dad83e5ea27c672d024d779,Abstract 4810: Exome sequencing of refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphomas highlights candidate genes for targeted resequencing,"As the most common lymphoid malignancy, Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) has largely benefited from immunochemotherapy combinations developed in the past decade. However 30% to 40% of patients still do not respond to treatment, or relapse in a few months. The mechanisms involved in short term treatment failure are poorly understood, and biomarkers to predict refractoriness in newly diagnosed patients are still lacking. To address this issue, 14 normal / tumoral pairs of exomes from patients who progressed or relapsed within 12 months were sequenced on a HiSeq2500 platform. Somatic events were called using VarScan2, and significantly mutated pathways were highlighted by PathScan (False Discovery Rate, FDR \textless 0.001). Genes from 175 pathways were found to be more mutated than expected according to the background mutation rate observed throughout the exomes (2.68 non synonymous mutations per megabase, ranging from 0.69 to 4.66), including genes encoding histone monomers (HIST1H1/2) and transcription regulators (CREBBP, EP300, TP53), members and relatives of the NFKB signaling pathway (MYD88, TNFAIP3, NFKBIA/E), or other signaling cascades (IRF4, CIITA, SOCS1). To pinpoint genes and pathways unusually enriched in such refractory patients, a published series of 39 DLBCL genome pairs was used (Morin et al, Blood 2013). Variant annotation and filtering was reapplied to enforce target region consistency, and Fisher tests were conducted independently in the two series. 22 of the 175 pathways selected by PathScan were found to be enriched in refractory patients (FDR \textless 0.01) but not in the comparative series (FDR \textgreater 0.5). One of the most relevant was â€œIL4 mediated signaling eventsâ€, which includes genes such as STAT6, IRF4 or SOCS1. These 3 genes, along with 31 other genes frequently mutated in DLBCL, were sequenced in a series of 216 DLBCLs with an orthogonal method (PGM sequencer). Although the survival impact of IL4 related gene mutations could not be confirmed, their prevalence (17.5%) was far above what was previously described in DLBCL. Molecular profiling by Affymetrix U133+2 arrays revealed a strong association with the Primary Mediastinal B-Cell lymphoma (PMBL) subtype (Fisher p = 5e-10), a molecular subtype observed in 4/14 and 22/216 patients of the refractory and extended series respectively. We propose here an exhaustive description of mutations found in 14 exomes from refractory DLBCL patients, compared to 39 previously published genomes. The extension to 216 patients enrolled in the LNH03 LYSA (LYmphoma Study Association) clinical trial program using targeted resequencing and transcriptomic arrays allowed us to refine these results, and highlight the high prevalence of somatic mutations in IL4 signaling related genes in PMBLs.

(The convergence of structural and functional modularities in complex systems),"Background: With the improvement of genotyping technologies and the exponentially growing number of available markers, case-control genome-wide association studies promise to be a key tool for investigation of complex diseases. However new analytical methods have to be developed to face the problems induced by this data scale-up, such as statistical multiple testing, data quality control and computational tractability. Results: We present a novel method to analyze genome-wide association studies results. The algorithm is based on a Bayesian model that integrates genotyping errors and genomic structure dependencies. p-values are assigned to genomic regions termed bins, which are defined from a gene-biased partitioning of the genome, and the false-discovery rate is estimated. We have applied this algorithm to data coming from three genome-wide association studies of Multiple Sclerosis. Conclusion: The method practically overcomes the scale-up problems and permits to identify new putative regions statistically associated with the disease. Background The last years have shown a tremendous increase in the number of markers available for association studies. Previous studies were dealing either with the whole genome at a very low resolution (for instance 5 264 microsatellites in [1]) or with a carefully chosen region of few millions of base pairs [2,3]. Recent technologies allow the genomewide genotyping of hundred of thousands SNPs [4]. This has arisen the need of new methodological developments to overcome different issues, such as the multiple-testing problem, gene biases, data quality analysis and the computational tractability. Firstly, the multiple testing problem seems to cause association studies ability to detect associations to decrease as the number of markers increases. The classical analysis strategy, based on an association test for each marker [5], encounters increasing difficulties as more than one million of markers are available: Increasing the number of markers prevents from the detection of the mild genetic effects expected in complex diseases, as only strong effects from Machine Learning in Systems Biology: MLSB 2007 Evry, France. 24â€“25 September 2007 Published: 17 December 2008 BMC Proceedings 2008, 2(Suppl 4):S6   <p>Selected Proceedings of Machine Learning in Systems Biology: MLSB 2007</p>  Florence d'AlchÃ©-Buc and Louis Wehenkel Proceedings  This article is available from: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1753-6561/2/S4/S6 Â© 2008 Omont et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

BMC Proceedings 2008, 2(Suppl 4):S6 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1753-6561/2/S4/S6 Page 2 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes) emerges from the huge noise generated by the increased quantity of data. Methods like False Discovery Rate (FDR) [6] computation allow to control the error rigorously, but do not increase the statistical power. Better strategies based on haplotype blocks are being developed, the first step being gathering such block data (see the HapMap project, [7]). The gain of such strategies is two-folded: (i) the number of tests is independent of the number of markers (ii) the statistical power may be increased if markers of the same haplotype block are not fully correlated. Secondly, a genetic association of a given SNP is a statistical feature and does not explain by itself a phenotype. To biologically interpret an associated marker, its haplotype block should first be delimited. Then, the association can be refined by fine-scale genotyping technologies or ideally by full resequencing. This eventually allows to identify functional mutations. Most of the time, these mutations impact relatively close genes. This is a first argument to bias association analysis towards genes. Moreover, even if haplotype blocks are unreachable, DNA might be cut into distinct regions (called bins) on another basis, so as to limit the multiple-testing problem and make it independent of the number of markers. Combining these two arguments leads to choose one bin for each gene, and to create ""desert"" bins in large unannotated regions. It allows to associate a list of genes with a test, which simplifies the analysis of results. The drawbacks are (i) that it makes more difficult the study of these ""deserts"", however the goal is here to maximize, not the chance of finding an association, but the chance of elucidating a mechanism of a complex disease given the current knowledge (ii) that a bin might contain several haplotype blocks, resulting in a dilution of the association signal if only one block is associated. Reciprocally, neighbor bins are not independent because they may share a haplotype block. However, with the classical strategy, correlated neighbor SNPs would also be tested separately. Thirdly, genome-wide genotyping data are obtained by high-throughput experiments which encompass limitations requiring careful statistical methodology. Especially, with Affy. technology, the trade-off between the call rate (i.e. errors detected by the genotyping process and resulting in missing genotypes in the data set) and the error rate (i.e. errors left in the data) is difficult to adjust. Obtaining unbiased statistical results is then conditioned to good pre-processing filters. Indeed spurious markers must be eliminated and missing data correctly managed. In addition, for most of SNPs used in this study, some genotypes are held by less than few percents of patients, which, given the usual collection size of a few hundreds, (i) is not enough for good asymptotic approximations and (ii) should be considered with care given possible high error rate. Finally, whatever algorithmic solution is developed, because the number of markers available will probably quickly reach a few millions, creating a scalability problem, it has to be linear in the number of markers. In this paper we present a novel Bayesian algorithm developed to easily analyze genome-wide association studies. This algorithm is based on a gene-based partitioning of DNA into regions, called bins. A p-value of association is computed for each bin. The model takes into account genotyping errors and missing data and tries to detect simple differences in the haplotype block structure between cases and controls. The study of different collections is allowed. The multiple testing problem is addressed by estimation of FDR. The method has been applied to analyze the results of three genome-wide case-control association studies of the complex disease Multiple Sclerosis (MS). It identifies putatively associated bins, containing genes previously described to be linked to MS (see [8] for review) as well as new candidate genes. Materials Three association studies dealing with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in three independent collections have been realized. Around 600 patients have been recruited for each study, half of them as cases affected by the disease, half of them as controls (Table 1).

Our aims were to characterize the resting-state functional connectivity of medial temporal lobe sub-structures in older adults, and evaluate whether specific substructural (rather than global) functional connectivity relates to memory function.


METHODS
In 15 adults (mean age: 69 years), we evaluated the resting state functional connectivity of medial temporal lobe substructures: dentate/Cornu Ammonis (CA) 4, CA1, CA2/3, subiculum, the molecular layer, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampus. We used 7-Tesla susceptibility weighted imaging and magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequences to segment substructures of the hippocampus, which were used as structural seeds for examining functional connectivity in a resting BOLD sequence. We then assessed correlations between functional connectivity with memory performance (short and long delay free recall on the California Verbal Learning Test [CVLT]).


RESULTS
All the seed regions had significant connectivity within the temporal lobe (including the fusiform, temporal, and lingual gyri). The left CA1 was the only seed with significant functional connectivity to the amygdala. The left entorhinal cortex was the only seed to have significant functional connectivity with frontal cortex (anterior cingulate and superior frontal gyrus). Only higher left dentate-left lingual connectivity was associated with poorer CVLT performance (Spearman râ€‰=â€‰-0.81, pâ€‰=â€‰0.0003, Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate: 0.01) after multiple comparison correction.


CONCLUSIONS
Rather than global hyper-connectivity of the medial temporal lobe, left dentate-lingual connectivity may provide a specific assay of medial temporal lobe hyper-connectivity relevant to memory in aging.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Stephen F.

7c9dfd1271d94a568b33c07b9d0cf92c42d7f86a,Proton Chemical Shift Imaging of the Brain in Pediatric and Adult Developmental Stuttering,"Importance Developmental stuttering is a neuropsychiatric condition of incompletely understood brain origin. Our recent functional magnetic resonance imaging study indicates a possible partial basis of stuttering in circuits enacting self-regulation of motor activity, attention, and emotion. Objective To further characterize the neurophysiology of stuttering through in vivo assay of neurometabolites in suspect brain regions. Design, Setting, and Participants Proton chemical shift imaging of the brain was performed in a case-control study of children and adults with and without stuttering. Recruitment, assessment, and magnetic resonance imaging were performed in an academic research setting. Main Outcomes and Measures Ratios of N-acetyl-aspartate plus N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAA) to creatine (Cr) and choline compounds (Cho) to Cr in widespread cerebral cortical, white matter, and subcortical regions were analyzed using region of interest and data-driven voxel-based approaches. Results Forty-seven children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years (22 with stuttering and 25 without) and 47 adults aged 21 to 51 years (20 with stuttering and 27 without) were recruited between June 2008 and March 2013. The mean (SD) ages of those in the stuttering and control groups were 12.2 (4.2) years and 13.4 (3.2) years, respectively, for the pediatric cohort and 31.4 (7.5) years and 30.5 (9.9) years, respectively, for the adult cohort. Region of interestâ€“based findings included lower group mean NAA:Cr ratio in stuttering than nonstuttering participants in the right inferior frontal cortex (âˆ’7.3%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.02), inferior frontal white matter (âˆ’11.4%; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), and caudate (âˆ’10.6%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.04), while the Cho:Cr ratio was higher in the bilateral superior temporal cortex (left: +10.0%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.03 and right: +10.8%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.01), superior temporal white matter (left: +14.6%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.003 and right: +9.5%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.02), and thalamus (left: +11.6%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.002 and right: +11.1%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.001). False discovery rateâ€“corrected voxel-based findings were highly consistent with region of interest findings. Additional voxel-based findings in the stuttering sample included higher NAA:Cr and Cho:Cr ratios (regression coefficient, 197.4-275; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001) in the posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, hippocampal, and parahippocampal cortices and amygdala, as well as lower NAA:Cr and Cho:Cr ratios (regression coefficient, 119.8-275; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001) in the superior frontal and frontal polar cortices. Affected regions comprised nodes of the Bohland speech-production (motor activity regulation), default-mode (attention regulation), and emotional-memory (emotion regulation) networks. Regional correlations were also observed between local metabolites and stuttering severity (râ€‰=â€‰0.40-0.52; Pâ€‰=â€‰.001-.02). Conclusions and Relevance This spectroscopy study of stuttering demonstrates brainwide neurometabolite alterations, including several regions implicated by other neuroimaging modalities. Prior ascription of a role in stuttering to inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri, caudate, and other structures is affirmed. Consistent with prior functional magnetic resonance imaging findings, these results further intimate neurometabolic aberrations in stuttering in brain circuits subserving self-regulation of speech production, attention, and emotion.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Joseph Oâ\200\231Neill"", ids = ""1422230130""); list(name = ""Zhengchao Dong"", ids = ""145961253""); list(name = ""Ravi Bansal"", ids = ""145303654""); list(name = ""Iliyan Ivanov"", ids = ""26897575""); list(name = ""Xuejun Hao"", ids = ""1754851""); list(name = ""Jay Desai"", ids = ""47056238""); list(name = ""Elena Pozzi"", ids = ""49204128""); list(name = ""Bradley S.

The aim of this study was to analyse the transcriptome of CD19+ B cells from patients with pSS and healthy controls to decipher the B cell-specific contribution to pSS. RNA from purified CD19+ B cells from 12 anti-SSA antibody-positive untreated female patients with pSS and 20 healthy blood donors was subjected to whole transcriptome sequencing. A false discovery rate corrected significance threshold of Î±Â <Â 0.05 was applied to define differential gene expression. As validation, gene expression in B cells from 17 patients with pSS and 16 healthy controls was analysed using a targeted gene panel. RNA-sequencing identified 4047 differentially expressed autosomal genes in pSS B cells. Upregulated expression of type I and type II interferon (IFN)-induced genes was observed, establishing an IFN signature in pSS B cells. Among the top upregulated and validated genes were CX3CR1, encoding the fractalkine receptor involved in regulation of B-cell malignancies, CCL5/RANTES and CCR1. Increased expression of several members of the TNF superfamily was also identified; TNFSF4/Ox40L, TNFSF10/TRAIL, TNFSF13B/BAFF, TNFRSF17/BCMA as well as S100A8 and -A9/calprotectin, TLR7, STAT1 and STAT2. Among genes with downregulated expression in pSS B cells were SOCS1 and SOCS3, CD70 and TNFAIP3/A20. We conclude that B cells from patients with anti-SSA antibody-positive pSS display immune activation with upregulated expression of chemokines, chemokine receptors and a prominent type I and type II IFN signature, while suppressors of cytokine signalling are downregulated. This adds insight into the autoimmune process and suggests potential targets for future functional studies.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""J Imgenberg-Kreuz"", ids = ""1401589357""); list(name = ""Johanna K.

244fdc9f4ec96ac386dfc06ab36adda09a468a84,Preliminary Evidence for Leukocyte Transcriptional Signatures for Pediatric Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia,"Objective: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a significant contributor to intensive care unit (ICU) morbidity and mortality and presents a significant diagnostic challenge. Our hypothesis was that blood RNA expression profiles can be used to track the response to VAP in children, using the same methods that proved informational in adults. Design: A pilot, nonrandomized, repeated measures case-control study of changes in the abundance of total RNA in buffy coat and clinical scores for VAP. Setting: A large, multispecialty university-based pediatric ICU and cardiac ICU. Patients: Seven children requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Interventions: Blood samples were drawn at time of enrollment and every 48 hours for a maximum of 11 samples (21 days). Patients ranged in age from 1 to 18 months (mean 8 months). All patients survived to the end of the study. Of the 7 patients studied, 4 developed VAP. Measurements and Main Results: Statistical analysis of the Affymetrix Human Genome Focus GeneChip signal was conducted on normalized expression values of 8793 probe sets using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a false discovery rate of 0.10. The expression patterns of 48 genes appeared to discriminate between the 2 classes of ventilated children: those with and those without pneumonia.

6470ca07d9fe23f4f364a6584da954417644fb94,On the performance of FDR control: Constraints and a partial solution,"The False Discovery Rate (FDR) paradigm aims to attain certain control on Type I errors with relatively high power for multiple hypothesis testing. The Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg (BH) procedure is a wellknown FDR controlling procedure. Under a random effects model, we show that, in general, unlike the FDR, the positive FDR (pFDR) of the BH procedure cannot be controlled at an arbitrarily low level due to the limited evidence provided by the observations to separate false and true nulls. This results in a criticality phenomenon, which is characterized by a transition of the procedureâ€™s power from being positive to asymptotically 0 without any reduction in the pFDR, once the target FDR control level is below a positive critical value. To address the constraints on the power and pFDR control imposed by the criticality phenomenon, we propose a procedure which applies BH-type procedures at multiple locations in the domain of p-values. Both analysis and simulations show that the proposed procedure can attain substantially improved power and pFDR control.",2007,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Zhiyi Chi"", ids = ""3140471"")",0b87de1dc5b30fbc2255ee7c366bccf65ebd8bec; 34382262d4407dbf2781acd514965b22c9350237; 65088aea57ef71119bbfcc2b2b320dea8484e878; 5c782465103f03438a627124bc06a0f0e99e08a9; 922260aeb40382c89f361507a44defdb97da5a22; 232d9f3f3c1420a8ac68bac6036002083bd6c0b5; 2f2c79c6e2c6cd513c1f8047129ef0d54c0539fb; d60004fb5fe01f2ae4aacbb5f3839ed97d307661; b0397532153c0978f75bd542b73db0349db8ad1c; 467966480503191520274a4b865ed23ba0594977; e570728b6966e4e1c143da60e8256f13e948d4e7; 9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6; 234cff6937c43cb1c4d3510faeda6c8720737f9d; a79f81b36a321df4176311832702a817cbeaf54b; 4c850f993f637e55275c902ae43cf6019592016a; ff78265a35edeb990632663c53ff8cc506ecdca9; 9c277ec5dfa4cfb137b627b81a61651d8948173c; 92013517811f387db2d75b6f81a524813c760218; b766bc526253c87e204701d7055fd338f8f74c08; 1c49766cd3d2e19089fea703e579a73011946ac7; c794fd003dabe1b4d09ff081ecd9fe0566b729ef; 6a63a002019038f2a3fa11d30a5c9e1c4633ffcb; 2c64d50c9a9eb1deefb90e3f719f0a2da403e56d; 623029ae0217fc6d3e1a4d5ad1f5704530a5f0c1; fd4de5e69b3942e3ff28ed06f1722b0e17d5fadf; fea0fece10845ec89f1929f3a0ce81bb1450d2b9,e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; d51139172202e5a5e0000415571deaf2b1ac0b72; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; e0602c5359e059d9395eda68cf5b15cd3df3206d; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; 43db684dc246d0f28a36b7cec3b84f1fe2cef0b4; 0cd6a57304e89656611273d9d58d918b52e9c81e; 3a00fd37ea0800bddf255722e691af52d41b72de; 56defcc4d278c24e8517a43ad6e739b760622f1d; 9c277ec5dfa4cfb137b627b81a61651d8948173c; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6,Annals of Statistics,35,1409-1431

Most existing methods require equal or similar sample sizes among classes. However, many real applications do not have similar sample sizes. Hence, the joint adaptive graphical lasso, a weighted l 1 penalized approach is proposed for unbalanced multi-class problems. The joint adaptive graphical lasso approach combines information across classes so that their common characteristics can be shared during the estimation process. Regularization is also introduced into the adaptive term. Simulation studies show that the new approach performs better than existing methods in terms of false positive rate, accuracy, Mathews correlation coefficient, and false discovery rate. The advantages of the new approach are also demonstrated using a liver cancer data set.",2018,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Liang Shan"", ids = ""144269141""); list(name = ""Inyoung Kim"", ids = ""2359365"")",ea15c749d88397072b8666f9625c5871b32c010e,,Comput.

It is pointed out by Gavrilov, Benjamini and Sarkar that step down multiple tests based on the critical values $\beta_i=\frac{i\alpha}{n+1-i(1-\alpha)}$ still control the false discovery rate (FDR) at the upper bound $\alpha$ under basic independence assumptions. Since that result in not longer true for step up tests or dependent single tests, a big discussion about the corresponding FDR starts in the literature. The present paper establishes finite sample formulas and bounds for the FDR and the expected number of false rejections for multiple tests using critical values $\beta_i$ under martingale and reverse martingale dependence models. It is pointed out that martingale methods are natural tools for the treatment of local FDR estimators which are closely connected to the present coefficients $\beta_i.$ The martingale approach also yields new results and further inside for the special basic independence model.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Julia Benditkis"", ids = ""89405459""); list(name = ""Arnold Janssen"", ids = ""34626641"")",,1c2ecba69104f49b0c5153fc70462c959063062f; 087f9482b1ad71e449c7ad758a3b235626168cc5; 1900e254a8923892e0bdd6a0315bb845ceb6bc3e; 56defcc4d278c24e8517a43ad6e739b760622f1d; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 92f3a9e69314d9b6368a30feeb07bafc8b8dc0cf; e0602c5359e059d9395eda68cf5b15cd3df3206d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 1c49766cd3d2e19089fea703e579a73011946ac7; 2544949c65e5bf3898df558375b72cda49d83ccc; 95686586f26d5a1d152db72f6283c7a73335a513; 7ccdb4cad5622783e44a3a70f5ee88cf067cefd4; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 47d1f32aa0e760d570fdd57a95280f0618f1003a; a97e8af759381536766a5c2dfcb611fa0066c93c; 8becaa4ddafe17458e0dd94fbd75d32a47d84d27; 39a1100252ace4be82cd692ae5133f4920dd9317; 3eeb4ebf8df49c48c779ebbdc7878290f21e56ca; 735cfe384afa5e090cb4cc70c1f56dd664ad6a64; 0a34081265123f536e43febd3c57ba5c25dd334b,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,1827-1857

This study aims to evaluate the association among race, neighborhood disadvantage index (NDI), and gut microbiome in patients undergoing screening colonoscopy. Methods: The study includes 689 patients aged 50â€“80 years undergoing screening colonoscopy at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Each patient donated a stool sample 1â€“4 weeks prior to their colonoscopy examination. 16S ribosomal RNA genes in stools were sequenced and classified into 236 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) to species level. Neighborhood Disadvantage Index (NDI) was derived from 17 variables reflecting neighborhood contextual environment. We first examined the association of race with microbiota, and race with NDI. We then examined further the association between NDI and each microbiota by linear mixed effect model to account for the correlation within census tract, with adjustment of age, sex, BMI, smoking, and sequencing batch. The significance of associations between microbiota and NDI are evaluated by likelihood ratio tests. Q-value was estimated for False Discovery Rate (FDR)-based multiple testing correction. For the microbiota associated with NDI with Q-value â‡ 0.05, we additionally adjusted for genetic ancestry in the model in a subset of 222 patients who have available genome-wide ancestry informative SNP genotype data. Results: Of all the 172 microbiota that have minimum relative abundances >0.005, 13 microbiota were significantly associated with race. We speculate that such association with race could be at least partially driven by neighborhood socioeconomic environment, i.e., racialized neighborhood environment - given the high correlation of race and NDI (corr = 0.60, P = 3.38E-56). Multivariate-adjusted regression models showed that 5 microbiota were positively associated with NDI (Q-value",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Xue-qiang Sun"", ids = ""46793886""); list(name = ""Zhao-feng Chen"", ids = ""49864939""); list(name = ""Feifang Yuan"", ids = ""38501063""); list(name = ""R Chan"", ids = ""1406042753""); list(name = ""Gs Cooper"", ids = ""153016340""); list(name = ""Lu-xun Li"", ids = ""8446810"")",,,Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Biomarkers,29,695-695

However, there is uncertainty in the identification of AMT tags, because this is based on matching LC-MS/MS fragmentation spectra to peptide sequences. In this paper, we incorporate confidence measures for the AMT tag identifications into the calculation of probabilities for correct matches to an AMT tag database, resulting in a more accurate overall measure of identification confidence for the AMT tag approach. The method is referenced as Statistical Tools for AMT Tag Confidence (STAC). STAC additionally provides a uniqueness probability (UP) to help distinguish between multiple matches to an AMT tag and a method to calculate an overall false discovery rate (FDR).

f943048759ead3149b1801800809b477fe992c15,Estimating the Arm-Wise False Discovery Rate in Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization Experiments,"Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) is an array-based technology which provides simultaneous spot assays of relative genetic abundance (RGA) levels at multiple sites across the genome. These spot assays are spatially correlated with respect to genomic location and, as a result, the univariate tests conducted using data generated from these spot assays are also spatially correlated. In the context of multiple hypothesis testing, this spatial correlation complicates the question of how best to define a `discovery' and consequently, how best to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) corresponding to a given rejection region.One can quantify the number of discoveries as the total number of spots for which the spot-based univariate test statistic falls within a given rejection region. Under this spot-based method, separate but correlated discoveries are identified. We show via a simulation study that the method of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) can provide a reasonable estimate of the spot-wise FDR, but these results require that the simulated spot assays are categorized as true or false discoveries in a particular way. However, laboratory researchers may actually be interested in estimating a `regional' FDR, rather than a `local' spot-wise FDR. We describe an example of such circumstances, and present a method for estimating the (chromosome) arm-wise False Discovery Rate.

One type of alteration is the reaction of diesel fuel with concentrated sulfuric acid. Such reactions are known to subtly alter the chemical composition of the fuel, particularly the aromatic species native to the fuel. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCÃ—GC-TOFMS) is well suited for the analysis of diesel fuel, but may provide the analyst with an overwhelming amount of data, particularly in sample-class comparison experiments comprised of many samples. Tile-based Fisher-ratio (F-ratio) analysis reduces the abundance of data in a GCÃ—GC-TOFMS experiment to only the peaks which significantly distinguish the unaltered and acid altered sample classes. Three samples of diesel fuel from differently branded filling stations were each altered to discover chemical features, i.e., analyte peaks, which were consistently changed by the acid reaction. Using different fuels prioritizes the discovery of features likely to be robust to the variation present between fuel samples and may consequently be useful in determining whether an unknown sample has been acid altered. The subsequent analysis confirmed that aromatic species are removed by the acid alteration, with the degree of removal consistent with predicted reactivity toward electrophilic aromatic sulfonation. Additionally, we observed that alkenes and alkynes were also removed from the fuel, and that sulfur dioxide or compounds that degrade to sulfur dioxide are generated by the acid alteration. In addition to applying the previously reported tile-based F-ratio method, this report also expands null distribution analysis to algorithmically determine an F-ratio threshold to confidently select only the features which are sufficiently class-distinguishing. When applied to the acid alteration of diesel fuel, the suggested per-hit F-ratio threshold was 12.4, which is predicted to maintain the false discovery rate (FDR) below 0.1%. Using this F-ratio threshold, 107 of the 3362 preliminary hits were deemed significantly changing due to the acid alteration, with the number of false positives estimated to be about 3. Validation of the F-ratio analysis was performed using an additional three fuels.",2016,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Brendon A. Parsons"", ids = ""40376226""); list(name = ""David K.

e8b84b1ec7976c99e67ff2e47ddee6409ac381ef,Abstract 43: Increased Activation of Inflammatory Genes in Monocytes of Healthy People with Ischemic White Matter Disease,"Introduction: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI represent small vessel ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Greater WMH burden is associated with higher levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines in persons > 65 years with dementia, suggesting a pro-inflammatory vascular process. We hypothesized that middle-aged, asymptomatic, apparently healthy high risk people with high WMH burden would demonstrate increased inflammatory gene expression in monocytes analyzed with microarray.

Methods: Subjects (N=70) were identified from a larger MRI study in 593 healthy family members of persons with early-onset CAD (< 60 years). We obtained monocytes and examined gene expression in all subjects (mean age 58.1 Â± 10 years, range 30-73; 55% female; 36% African American). These included 35 subjects with the greatest WMH burden using volumetric methods in the larger study, and 35 unrelated age-sex-race matched controls with the lowest WMH burden. Monocyte mRNA was analyzed on Illumina Human HT12 v4 microarrays. We performed unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) followed by ANOVA between high and low WMH groups. Genes with 2 SD differences in expression between groups were included for Gene Ontology permutation analysis using 1000 permutations within â€œGoMinerâ€. Only genes with the lowest false discovery rate (FDR) were summarized.

Results: PCA identified no significant clustering. A total of 1,315 genes were included in gene ontology analysis and resulted in 10 ontological categories with an FDR<0.01%. This included 164 genes all showing greater expression in the high WMH group. These were key inflammatory genes, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), toll like receptor 5 and 7 (TLR5, TLR7) and integrin alpha 5 and M (ITGA5, ITGAM).

Conclusions: Gene microarray ontological analysis of monocytes in healthy middle aged high risk people with greater WMH burden shows increased activation of genes of known innate inflammatory pathways. These findings likely reflect greater pro-inflammatory processes in persons with greater WMH, consistent with the presence of inflammation-mediated occult small vessel cerebrovascular disease in a healthy middle-aged population at increased risk for vascular diseases.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Paul A.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within apoptosis-related genes could affect apoptotic responses and their identification might provide a basis to assess individual risk for development of early lesions. To investigate a possible association between genetic polymorphisms and the occurrence of hyperplastic polyps (HP), we developed a custom DNA chip assay for 1,536 SNPs in the coding and flanking regions of 826 genes with known functional roles in apoptosis or apoptosis-associated (e.g., stress-related) pathways. During a first round of screening, genotypes were determined for 272 endoscopy patients harboring hyperplastic colorectal polyps and for 512 sex and aged-matched controls. A set of 14 candidate SNPs associated with HP (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) was then evaluated in an independent cohort of patients (nâ€‰=â€‰38) and controls (nâ€‰=â€‰38). Following meta-analysis of Stages I and II, a false discovery rate approach was applied. Among the 14 candidate SNPs, eight showed significant association (combined Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) with the occurrence of HP. The SNPs rs4709583 (PARK2) and rs10476823 (HDAC3) were analyzed for potential functional effects on RNA splicing and RNA half-life. Despite its location near a splice site, alternative splicing was not detected for rs4709583 (PARK3). By contrast, cDNA analysis revealed use of a cryptic polyadenylation signal in the 3'UTR of HDAC3 mRNA and a longer mRNA half-life in a cell line heterozygous for rs10476823.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Stefano Gerola"", ids = ""11977858""); list(name = ""Stefanie Nittka"", ids = ""3796199""); list(name = ""Georg F.

90e7599133e0ac18cae9a721bf1227b4661ab949,A New Multiple Testing Method in the Dependent Case,"The most popular multiple testing procedures are stepwise procedures based on P-values for individual test statistics. Included among these are the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedures of Benjaminiâ€•Hochberg [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 57 (1995) 289â€•300] and their offsprings. Even for models that entail dependent data, P-values based on marginal distributions are used. Unlike such methods, the new method takes dependency into account at all stages. Furthermore, the P-value procedures often lack an intuitive convexity property, which is needed for admissibility. Still further, the new methodology is computationally feasible. If the number of tests is large and the proportion of true alternatives is less than say 25 percent, simulations demonstrate a clear preference for the new methodology. Applications are detailed for models such as testing treatments against control (or any intra-class correlation model), testing for change points and testing means when correlation is successive.",2009,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Arthur Cohen"", ids = ""143698811""); list(name = ""Harold Sackrowitz"", ids = ""2549916""); list(name = ""Minya Xu"", ids = ""17689179"")",b23f2d0f9f32a957740080d8f793feb69c8fa89d; 28ad6515e509e6433123403ad73256224a3758bc; 761be53c131dce9690a4a265a90f92be2124a47b; 3c3faf3fa0483a76b599746eefbe39dbe93ac3c5; fb198d4d563d2c7d5aafb30ca7ab40b40801abfa; 80bbc122f6fffc5b06463fa0785f2867a6bcdc22; 45142859dd706fc673973db3610bff9f2a495d8b,7d1f769cd7eb29381a910a793e1343c2aeb2b0e5; da28521e8485cdb83c214bf53228545abe2ba8b9; 6cd45f7034f5bd148c225a477412bfbe18fee0b6; 46db184e10288c44e77fc817665f1ddabf01c096; 6d2ee94678be64c1eba2c87f5da237342de49680; 7ca1ecfbc73c8f22c03eb2c2ec54254232a9bc65; 871e801536dc7d5b52eae7b8ff62b00ac968a0b2; 3eeb4ebf8df49c48c779ebbdc7878290f21e56ca; 4d6022aa45c5289f9e1cc378c8348f97e1625be4; bcc2db5d229cc04d6452e7a101687384de4a6b9c; 3a10d13d9c9d508a5bf22d9b78c738156405608f; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; ff55acc166a94262eb6438f7945baa6c0f286344; 03be636697c84eb22114f09de6c1bea215cc87c8; ca5d2386c3379245483c7bf0b9e435474a4cd592; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 4880201c57d2dfc77311333096f00c174187bc87; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 68ba9d3524a907126711ae24681b60d92c4fd5be; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 0514c2895a30b47b7c0449ddc87c5f6b7e4f1556; 8480ce3ac1ab13b301e27ba4fdd3ab0b06540e7a; 9c62d39c17322a85d7fb1f2063e3143b8f9f00e1,Annals of Statistics,37,1518-1544
cbf1644f5a445304b20ae5f2ac5b9baa7108400e,Identification of abrogated pathways in fallopian tube epithelium from BRCA1 mutation carriers.,"The discovery of occult invasive and intra-epithelial tubal carcinomas in BRCA1 mutation carriers undergoing prophylactic surgery has implicated the fallopian tube epithelium as the source of serous cancer. However, little is known of the early molecular events of serous oncogenesis, or why cancers in BRCA1 mutation carriers are found preferentially in tissues which are responsive to reproductive hormones. We hypothesize that molecular alterations present in morphologically normal tubal epithelium from BRCA1 heterozygotes reflect the earliest events in serous carcinogenesis and may be markers of increased cancer risk as well as targets for risk reduction. Genetic profiling of microdissected tubal epithelium from histologically normal BRCA1 mutation carriers and controls was performed. We sought to define a signature which differentiated BRCA1 mutant tubal epithelium from women with low risk of developing ovarian cancer. Molecular differences between the follicular and luteal phases were prominent and, by using filtering techniques and a two-way ANOVA without a False Discovery Rate correction, we identified 440 probe sets with a more than two-fold change in gene expression related to BRCA1 mutation status. Using gene ontology and known associations to cancer pathways, we selected five genes for further analysis by qPCR and immunohistochemistry, and were able to demonstrate statistically significant differentiation of BRCA1 and control cases in an independent set of cases. The altered expression profiles in histologically normal tubal epithelium from BRCA1 heterozygotes suggest that these cells may respond differently to microenvironmental stresses.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sophia H.

Only a small fraction of this heritability is explained by the genetic variants identified so far, underscoring the need to investigate other disease mechanisms, such as gene-environment (GxE) interactions and parent-of-origin (PoO) effects. Furthermore, PoO effects may vary across exposure levels (PoOxE effects). Such variation is the focus of this study. We upgraded the R-package Haplin to enable direct tests of PoOxE effects at the genome-wide level. From a previous GWAS, we had genotypes for 550 case-parent trios, of mainly European and Asian ancestry, and data on three maternal exposures (smoking, alcohol, and vitamins). Data were analyzed for Europeans and Asians separately, and also for all ethnicities combined. To account for multiple testing, a false discovery rate method was used, where q-values were generated from the p-values. In the Europeans-only analyses, interactions with maternal smoking yielded the lowest q-values. Two SNPs in the 'Interactor of little elongation complex ELL subunit 1' (ICE1) gene had a q-value of 0.14, and five of the 20 most significant SNPs were in the 'N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase-like 2' (NAALADL2) gene. No evidence of PoOxE effects was found in the other analyses. The connections to ICE1 and NAALADL2 are novel and warrant further investigation.

Stem cells from the adult human brain can be propagated and expanded in vitro as free floating neurospheres that are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into all three cell types of the central nervous system. Here we report the first global gene expression study of adult human neural stem-like cells originating from five human subventricular zone biopsies (mean age 42, range 33-60). Compared to adult human brain tissue, we identified 1,189 genes that were significantly up- and down-regulated in adult human neural stem-like cells (1% false discovery rate). We found that adult human neural stem-like cells express stem cell markers and have reduced levels of markers that are typical of the mature cells in the nervous system. We report that the genes being highly expressed in adult human neural stem-like cells are associated with developmental processes and the extracellular region of the cell. The calcium signaling pathway and neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions are enriched among the most differentially regulated genes between adult human neural stem-like cells and adult human brain tissue. We confirmed the expression of 10 of the most up-regulated genes in adult human neural stem-like cells in an additional sample set that included adult human neural stem-like cells (nâ€Š=â€Š6), foetal human neural stem cells (nâ€Š=â€Š1) and human brain tissues (nâ€Š=â€Š12). The NGFR, SLITRK6 and KCNS3 receptors were further investigated by immunofluorescence and shown to be heterogeneously expressed in spheres. These receptors could potentially serve as new markers for the identification and characterisation of neural stem- and progenitor cells or as targets for manipulation of cellular fate.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Cecilie Jonsgar Sandberg"", ids = ""32684234""); list(name = ""Einar Osland Vik-Mo"", ids = ""1401843384""); list(name = ""Jinan Behnan"", ids = ""46264216""); list(name = ""Eirik Helseth"", ids = ""6386332""); list(name = ""Iver Arne Langmoen"", ids = ""3868280"")",a598c51b9d5d350ff1e0691d6acf8aa172d17ec8; 138c5fa49f4a9e2e57ff7d912570b1f91f30bd1e; fa01de43f4e065303922214ef7f8219f94d9d90e; f87bd4261c423b9f970081deeda9600f6301c806; 35bcb9cd13fe382cafc1213af02c57dea5b0aadb,7213c724ca3e26cbb37f6b7c77706773785863ee; badc2fa7510a25c18e52837656db974ecfd3666e; 50d893ccd164f79517deeee00d4f2c3ab5e8b158; 4667ad4302254f67ef8c831ede8e4cd8d0709715; b15be38f41eae2d5d50cafe4562179f46970882b; c6c207ee082ce268b40b87272570e62d49842b27; 168a9a7f816b6dd4cc485af28fce44e83bbaed8e; 504f24d7e50247fb97137c2866bc8e67aa259202; 960d7d73b8da8bdd3607861feb306a584ff18eaa; 2712c5aecc1dec0bf2c5e050038074eb9ce236d7; 3353cf6d102d9f9ccbae043a438a750230d89455; ef4f349c28216d3986ba7a7e4302b57732df12de; 6ade15601e6dd3d07ce49253225242f88065013e; 47905bb3cb3ed61917db1dc1ddffeee0a9528e00; b8f7298e0722746aed9ab598ac023ac96971926d; 4512a2c8838f47e6ba5113cea19b69542106b4de; 35b60e01d34cb8c46f788046668b21809e7369ee; 73a8837400b13f64796e41e12adc6621b10a4f39; 615ff39b02955c79d61cf765b729754a03fdc404; 6eb647af2b8099ce2634208eb35d34f19470078e; 7533602325e76341dd0e64a76d1beba615478495; dab530f683bb733874c2404eced4f7e2889b16e0; 625c127af778f843362effe13ad99bb7fe207ea4; ca09284d7ddbbcf67f69467d0b7ef6516f8fa54b; 2810851502a43c5b4fb960778a50ccafd5a30fc3; bebea436ac220951d28f62ff8df05e70876bc4c2; 4e9e2eb3181f127e6c536923fe67ec3dd1d91469; e3cfefc773218de594bd385b378a18a445e65b1a; dcf3554970ef95c46513aa880e61749ad11f9464; 9ee1a50e5882b773c35abf389f83350f4285bd70; 485fb7647619c807a8b53a8396870fe40598ff06; 22f4c7bf7fc9f16f0cacfaaa4437a4abc8316fec; 07cabf4b955a9821b3a58bb9f8e044dc7cece72e; 7bfcc6a0e894d38b02a9308f061c7d4c4d330640; cba1217b3cb7829e25bed4dd4a029090860b0b9e; f90913254cbf265f1ffea4b55c21369d0cbaf555; 421ed104902d8b480ccc1fbcd4324c103da6f260; cf795a20d85036c5d27d40b8175a74b57ddfd889; 57ed7b12dd7b84e329c40a05b4565fc025e4e6c9; 025275cf5bac46bf83424513d7e6fb138f9f107e; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; cfa40237629aa193b81b8164131f0fda98e1808e; 927e294d32a58617b6693c3ecb39a711b81a1ab3; cdcb022e6ee121d1c5b7d1db2b36cd6b0208c6d9; 8591f5447f4423c60ccf55e5089cdfc1934559b8; 6fc2dda8eb7d656677ad5e1ea4bca0f8cdb019d7; 957fed4fe44b005a8cce18ec76736bee2d436432; 6e43f5df35d7ed62acc304f6475cda6bab93570d; 916f28858f21d0f8bb077be73a04c16977b521be; 4234d5494ebc2eddd840e451e86d70cf024eeed5; e60a85da9705306cb39342d4c0301e71b0784520; 04c0fe468190985f33b6424be20192e795a61a9f; 6855c75b7177681c0639d0cdd4255fd07be377f0; 5badca343da3b075df25c76f87df15f7d9a0c9f1; ee1100ad1c06c2f574afcce2981991e2ce8830f0; 1238ceb7826ea9a28f1151aa8e5189c1f7926311; 7adfa33a009bd0b4c428ae48fd7c5ec3ffaf12e5,PLoS ONE,9,

YS has been selected for industrial interests such as a growth rate and lean meat production, while KNP has been maintained as a regional breed with local interests such as disease resistance and fat content in and between muscle. A comparison of gene expression profiles from liver tissue reflected overall long-term effects of artificial selection for these two pig breeds. Based on minimum positive false discovery rate (less than 10%) and fold change (|FC|>1.5), 73 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Functional analysis of these DEGs indicated clear distinctions in signaling capacity related to epidermal growth factor (EGF), extracellular structure, protein metabolism, and detoxification. Hepatic DEGs demonstrated the importance of hormonal and metabolic capabilities to differences between these two pig breeds.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Seung-Soo Kim"", ids = ""49899769""); list(name = ""Sora Kim"", ids = ""49899111""); list(name = ""Jung-Rok Kim"", ids = ""11385130""); list(name = ""Jin-Kyoo Moon"", ids = ""16007596""); list(name = ""Bong-Hwan Choi"", ids = ""35165742""); list(name = ""Jae-Won Lee"", ids = ""2808775""); list(name = ""Kwan-Suk Kim"", ids = ""1819550""); list(name = ""Tae-Hun Kim"", ids = ""40592439""); list(name = ""Hyun-jung Kim"", ids = ""1740930""); list(name = ""Cheol-Koo Lee"", ids = ""1949667"")",bd6fc56edaa6fccd2634a0938a9159fe228a2b98,,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",75 3,"

757515ed1d0132e3b4503eef4e5987f95220707d,Parental allele-specific genome architecture and transcription during the cell cycle,"A normal human somatic cell inherits two haploid genomes. Individual chromosomes of each pair have distinct parental origins and parental alleles are known to unequally contribute to cellular function. We integrated chromosome conformation (form) and gene transcription (function) analyses to dissect the dynamics of the maternal and paternal genomes in lymphoblastoid cells during the cell cycle. We found a distinct set of homologous alleles with very different activity often located close to boundaries of euchromatin and heterochromatin domains. We also identified a set of allele-biased topologically associating domains (TADs) that were small sized and had higher gene density. Thousands of genes show allelically biased expression (ABE) with false discovery rate < 0.05, and 98% of them have no allelic switching during G1, S, and G2/M phases. A subset of ABE genes are preferentially localized near TAD boundaries, enriched with chromatin organization transcription factor binding sites, and contained higher number of sequence variants in CCCTC-binding factor sites. Our results extend previous findings of sequence variation as a basis for unequal functional parental genomes. Investigation of haplotype-resolved form-function dynamics may further our understanding of phenotypic traits, genetic diseases, vulnerability to complex disorders, and the development of cancers.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Haiming Chen"", ids = ""47666483""); list(name = ""Sijia Liu"", ids = ""48642171""); list(name = ""Laura Seaman"", ids = ""153408464""); list(name = ""Cyrus Najarian"", ids = ""90599234""); list(name = ""Weisheng Wu"", ids = ""34447703""); list(name = ""Mats Ljungman"", ids = ""5714950""); list(name = ""Gerald A.

Neff (Self Identity 2:85â€“101, 2003a) proposes that they mutually influence each other, however, this proposition has not been tested yet. We conducted a pilot study to see if improvements from training one component spilled over to the other twoâ€”and whether these trainings had an impact on well-being. 80 participants completed 8Â weeks of self-compassionate writing exercises to enhance either self-kindness, common humanity, or mindfulness. Trait self-compassion was assessed using the six-factor model of the self-compassion scale. To address issues of alpha-error-inflation, the false discovery rate was fixed at 5%, and critical p values were adjusted accordingly. Participants in the mindfulness condition reported increased total self-compassion (pâ€‰=â€‰.009), which was accompanied by increased self-kindness (pâ€‰=â€‰.027) and lower isolation (pâ€‰=â€‰.045). Participants in the common humanity condition reported improved total self-compassion (pâ€‰=â€‰.018), lower over-identification (pâ€‰=â€‰.045), and higher life-satisfaction (pâ€‰=â€‰.049). The training in self-kindness failed to improve self-kindness or any other factor. These findings provide initial evidence that the components of self-compassion mutually enhance each other.

f3391f537bf71a1fc2b46e6015eb157e3453d77a,Empirical P rediction of T urnovers in NFL F ootball,"Turnovers in the National Football League (NFL) occur whenever a team loses possession of the ball due to a fumble, or an interception. Turnovers disrupt momentum of the offensive team, and represent lost opportunities to advance downfield and score. Teams with a positive differential turnover margin in a given game win 70% of the time. Turnovers are statistically rare events, occurring apparently randomly. These characteristics make them difficult to predict. This investigation advances the hypothesis that turnovers are predictable in NFL football. Machine learning models are developed to learn the concept: At any point within a football game, what is the likelihood that a turnover will be observed on the next play from scrimmage? Results presented suggest evidence to support the working hypothesis. Under certain conditions, both fumbles and interceptions can be anticipated at low false discovery rates (less than 15%). This approach may be useful to inform in-game strategies to mitigate the negative consequences of turnovers by an offensive team, or to maximize their probability by a defensive squad.",2016,,"list(name = ""Joel R.

45a1ac03a3e3ca86ec4a46533931887ce1a31dcb,"A fully automated , hierarchical classification method for detecting white matter lesions in Multiple Sclerosis","INTRODUCTION: Segmentation of white matter (WM) multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions is an important task. Development of fully automated methods (no user intervention) is a goal for which many attempts have been made. However, performance to date is not yet good enough for the use in clinical research studies, especially for different sets of images. One major problem with previous approaches is the large false positive rates. We have found this to be true for neural network classifiers [1,2], and so to improve this we propose using a twolevel, hierarchical classification method: a first-level, voxel-wise classifier followed by a novel second-level, cluster-wise classifier. The second-level classifier works with the output of the first-level classifier and therefore cannot correct false negative errors (missed lesions), but is capable of reducing false positives (false lesions). METHODS: Data: a small sample from a multisite clinical study dataset was taken (14 different sets of images), including 24 MS patients with T1w, T2w and PD images (0.97x0.97x3mm) plus manual lesion segmentations. Patients were split into a first-level training set of 10 subjects, a second-level training set of 5 subjects and a testing set of 9 subjects (assigned at random). Preprocessing: the T1w images were segmented into tissue-types white matter (WM), grey matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). All images were linearly registered/transformed to the T2w space, and were intensity normalized by dividing by their 95 percentile. From these, an artificial â€œPseudoFlairâ€ (PsF) image was calculated: PsF=(PD*T2w*T1w)/(PD+T2w); see Fig. 1b. Voxel-wise Features: (i) the PsF image intensity; (ii) its 3x3 neighbourhood; (iii) 3x3 and 9x9 multi-scale intensities (two 3x3 arrays of averages, using patches of size 3x3 and 9x9 voxels within the slice) [2]. Voxel-wise Classifier: a two-layer neural-network (perceptron) with 28 inputs (features), 100 hidden units and one sigmoidal output node. Second-level Classification: the voxel-wise output from the first-level classifier was thresholded at 0.5, clustered and used to calculate features. Cluster-wise Features: for each cluster, a set of ratios was calculated between statistics (mean, median, 75th/90th percentiles, or maximum intensity values) from two regions: (i) inside the cluster, to (ii) the exterior border of the cluster or all WM or all GM. These were done for each â€œsequenceâ€ separately (T1w, PD, PsF and â€œprobabilityâ€ output from the first-level classifier). A subset of 19 features was then selected, based on initial tests for discrimination power. Cluster-wise Classifier: a two-layer neural network with 19 input features, 100 hidden units and one sigmoidal output node. Performance Measures: Different thresholds (from 0.5 to 1.0) were applied to both the voxel-wise and cluster-wise neural network outputs when run on the testing set. In each case the True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN) were measured both for voxels and for lesion (cluster) counts, where a â€œtrueâ€ cluster is defined by overlap with a manually segmented lesion. Voxel-based results are given in, terms of True Positive Rate TPR=TP/(TP+FN) and False Discovery Rate FDR=FP/(FP+TP), while lesion count results are given in terms of the ratio of the number of FP or TP clusters to the number of true lesions. RESULTS: Fig. 1 shows example images (inputs, manual lesion segmentation and the classifier outputs). A 0.5 threshold was applied in both cases and clearly shows many False Positives in the voxel-wise output (although the False Negative rate was less than 1%). The cluster-wise output is obviously much cleaner and, in this example, shows three â€œfalse positiveâ€ lesions, at lower â€œprobabilityâ€ values. Fig. 2 shows results of the four quantitative performance measures. The most significant feature of these is that use of the cluster-wise classifier results in a large reduction in False Positives (left column) with only a very minor change in True Positives (right column). This is the case for both the lesion counting measures and the voxel-based measures. The largest change is seen in the False Positive lesion count, although this is grossly overestimated for low thresholds where fewer, but very large, clusters are formed, artificially lowering the cluster count. However, even for higher thresholds the reduction in false positives is substantial and offers clear improvements on what is possible with the first-level (voxel-wise) results, regardless of what threshold is applied. CONCLUSIONS: We have proposed a new, simple and user independent approach for detecting lesions using a two-level hierarchical classification scheme that employs both voxel-wise and cluster-wise classifiers (neural networks in this case, but not restricted to this at all). Results from different sets of images showed large reductions in False Positives while maintaining True Positives, demonstrating great potential for this approach. Future work will optimize the feature set and techniques for thresholding the classifier (â€œprobabilityâ€) outputs. We will also investigate what influence the errors in the manual segmentations have in this data.

Newborn screening (NBS) for presymptomatic detection of CF currently relies on a two-stage immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation panel algorithm that is sensitive but not specific for identifying affected neonates with a low positive predictive value. For the first time, we report the discovery of a panel of CF-specific metabolites from a single 3.2 mm diameter dried blood spot (DBS) punch when using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MS) as a high-throughput platform for nontargeted metabolite profiling from volume-restricted/biobanked specimens with quality control. This retrospective case-control study design identified 32 metabolites, including a series of N-glycated amino acids, oxidized glutathione disulfide, and nicotinamide that were differentially expressed in normal birth weight CF neonates without meconium ileus ( n = 36) as compared to gestational age/sex-matched screen-negative controls ( n = 44) after a false discovery rate adjustment ( q < 0.05). Also, 16 metabolites from DBS extracts allowed for discrimination of true CF cases from presumptive screen-positive carriers with one identified CFTR mutation and transient neonatal hypertrypsinogenemic neonates ( n = 72), who were later confirmed as unaffected due to a low sweat chloride (<29 mM) test result. Importantly, six CF-specific biomarker candidates satisfying a Bonferroni adjustment ( p < 7.25 Ã— 10-5) from three independent batches of DBS specimens included several amino acids depleted in circulation (Tyr, Ser, Thr, Pro, Gly) likely reflecting protein maldigestion/malabsorption. Additionally, CF neonates had lower ophthalmic acid as an indicator of oxidative stress due to impaired glutathione efflux from exocrine/epithelial tissue and elevation of an unknown trivalent peptide that was directly correlated with IRT (Ï = 0.332, p = 4.55 Ã— 10-4). Structural elucidation of unknown metabolites was performed by high-resolution MS/MS, whereas biomarker validation was realized when comparing a subset of metabolites from matching neonatal DBS specimens independently analyzed by direct infusion-MS/MS at an accredited NBS facility. This work sheds new light into the metabolic phenotype of CF early in life, which is required for better functional understanding of CFTR mutations of unknown clinical consequence and the development of more accurate yet cost-effective strategies for CF screening.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alicia DiBattista"", ids = ""12881698""); list(name = ""Nathan McIntosh"", ids = ""33297062""); list(name = ""Monica Lamoureux"", ids = ""50545100""); list(name = ""Osama Y Al-Dirbashi"", ids = ""1400590934""); list(name = ""Pranesh Chakraborty"", ids = ""1691100""); list(name = ""Philip Britz-McKibbin"", ids = ""1393699335"")",c795d7f5f4131fa6327530e6632db779e09b2d44; 24df693a43df4fdb06605a2bca30cf40e915f135; b0d832da2aa14e5f177ecba8211de0bcdf4a6415; 9ae1fefb889e50c1beab6e8c87241ad09278a889,,Journal of proteome research,18 3,"

The thalamus contains third-order relay neurons of the trigeminal system, and animal models as well as preliminary imaging studies in small cohorts of migraine patients have suggested a role of the thalamus in headache pathophysiology. However, larger studies using advanced imaging techniques in substantial patient populations are lacking. In the present study, we investigated changes of thalamic volume and shape in a large multicenter cohort of patients with migraine. High-resolution T1-weighted MRI data acquired at 3 tesla in 131 patients with migraine (38 with aura; 30.8 Â± 9 years old; 109 women; monthly attack frequency: 3.2 Â± 2.5; disease duration: 14 Â± 8.4 years) and 115 matched healthy subjects (29 Â± 7 years old; 81 women) from four international tertiary headache centers were analyzed. The thalamus and thalamic subnuclei, striatum, and globus pallidus were segmented using a fully automated multiatlas approach. Deformation-based shape analysis was performed to localize surface abnormalities. Differences between patients with migraine and healthy subjects were assessed using an ANCOVA model. After correction for multiple comparisons, performed using the false discovery rate approach (p < 0.05 corrected), significant volume reductions of the following thalamic nuclei were observed in migraineurs: central nuclear complex (F(1,233) = 6.79), anterior nucleus (F(1,237) = 7.38), and lateral dorsal nucleus (F(1,238) = 6.79). Moreover, reduced striatal volume (F(1,238) = 6.9) was observed in patients. This large-scale study indicates structural thalamic abnormalities in patients with migraine. The thalamic nuclei with abnormal volumes are densely connected to the limbic system. The data hence lend support to the view that higher-order integration systems are altered in migraine.


SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
This multicenter imaging study shows morphological thalamic abnormalities in a large cohort of patients with episodic migraine compared with healthy subjects using state-of-the-art MRI and advanced, fully automated multiatlas segmentation techniques. The results stress that migraine is a disorder of the CNS in which not only is brain function abnormal, but also brain structure is undergoing significant remodeling.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Stefano Magon"", ids = ""2404270""); list(name = ""Arne May"", ids = ""144741923""); list(name = ""Anne Stankewitz"", ids = ""6998091""); list(name = ""Peter J Goadsby"", ids = ""144099025""); list(name = ""Amy R.

The simulation software has been developed for emulating data originating from data-dependent and data-independent LC-MS workflows. Data from all types of commonly used hybrid mass spectrometers can be simulated. The algorithms are based on empirically derived physicochemical liquid and gas phase models for proteins and peptides. Sample composition in terms of complexity and dynamic range, as well as chromatographic, experimental and MS conditions, can be controlled and adjusted independently. The effect of on-column amounts, gradient length, mass resolution and ion mobility on search specificity will be demonstrated using tryptic peptides from human and yeast cellular lysates simulated over five orders of magnitude in dynamic range. Initial justification of the simulated data sets is achieved by comparing and contrasting the in silico simulated data to experimentally derived results from a 48 protein mixture, spanning a similar magnitude of five orders of magnitude. Additionally, experimental data from replicate and dilutions series experiments will be utilized to determine error rates at the peptide and protein level with respect to mass, area, retention and drift time.

a2a56fce0afc87daa3ef4e3ce6faf7bd8c8cf538,Routine Blood Tests Do Not Predict Survival in Patients with Glioblastoma-Multivariable Analysis of 497 Patients.,"BACKGROUND
Multiple reports have attributed a prognostic value to routine blood tests results for patients with glioblastoma. However, these studies have reported conflicting results and have often had small sample sizes. We sought to validate the prognostic value of the described tests in an independent glioblastoma patient population.


METHODS
We performed a retrospective single-center multivariable analysis of 497 patients with glioblastoma who had postoperatively undergone radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy to identify the prognostic value for median overall survival of hemoglobin, white blood cell, monocyte, neutrophil, leukocyte, and platelet counts, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and lactate dehydrogenase. We also evaluated known prognostic factors for survival such as patient age, intervention type, IDH1 status, Karnofsky clinical performance status, and postoperative treatment modality.


RESULTS
In a multivariable model, after correcting for multiple testing bias, biopsy alone (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.49; false discovery rate-adjusted P < 0.001) and monotherapy after surgery (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.66; false discovery rate-adjusted P < 0.001) remained significantly associated with worse median overall survival. Patient age and Karnofsky performance status score â‰¥70 did not significantly influence survival in the multivariable model. No routine blood test included in the multivariable analysis was significantly associated with survival.


CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, hemoglobin, white blood cell, monocyte, neutrophil, leukocyte, and platelet counts, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and lactate dehydrogenase levels did not independently predict for overall survival in patients with glioblastoma.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sybren L.

dec17ccc71fadb73ed26b85ae42f900a506344a7,Comprehensive analysis of differential gene expression profiles on D-galactosamine-induced acute mouse liver injury and regeneration.,"Microarray analysis of RNA from d-galactosamine (GalN)-administered mouse livers was performed to establish a global gene expression profile during injury and regeneration stages at two different doses. A single dose of GalN at 266 or 26.6 mg/kg body weight was given intraperitoneally, and the liver samples were obtained after 6, 24, and 72 h. Histopathologic studies enabled the classification of the D-galactosamine effect into injury (6, 24 h) and regeneration (72 h) stages. By using the Applied Biosystems mouse genome survey microarray, a total of 7267 out of 33,315 (21.8%) genes were found to be statistically reliable at p<0.05 by two-way ANOVA, and 1469 (4.4%) probes at false discovery rate <5% by significance analysis of microarray. Among the statistically reliable clones by both analytical methods, 389 genes were differentially expressed when compared with non-treated control, with more than a 1.625-fold difference (which equals 0.7 in log(2) scale) at one or more GalN treatment conditions and with less than 1.625-fold difference at all three vehicle-treated conditions. Three hundred thirty six genes and 13 genes were identified as injury- and regeneration-specific genes, respectively, showing that most of the transcriptomic changes were seen during the injury stage. Furthermore, multiple genes involved in protein synthesis and degradation, mRNA processing and binding, and cell cycle regulation showed variable transcript levels upon acute GalN administration.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Heekyoung Chung"", ids = ""39931234""); list(name = ""Hyunjun Kim"", ids = ""1903941""); list(name = ""Ki-Seok Jang"", ids = ""77353529""); list(name = ""Mingoo Kim"", ids = ""2377113""); list(name = ""Jungeun Yang"", ids = ""3646551""); list(name = ""Kyung-sun Kang"", ids = ""79661201""); list(name = ""Hyung-Lae Kim"", ids = ""37427742""); list(name = ""Byung-Il Yoon"", ids = ""2874005""); list(name = ""Mi-Ock Lee"", ids = ""88788328""); list(name = ""Byung-hoon Lee"", ids = ""3441579""); list(name = ""Ju Han Kim"", ids = ""46454310""); list(name = ""Yong-Sung Lee"", ids = ""1775381""); list(name = ""Gu Kong"", ids = ""38189249"")",d899982a428c4482810413ba384e872e72543ee6; b9c1a798ac56270cc5471ab330ff932f6bba6c61; c6e463311cea8d2b723734cd5e86c8d27f2eeac7; 81d9a877f1ebae419953ac9556f2e4fbca9d93d2; 7850622546e0586c32950ca8e5dec956f909a935,006869257c6cacfb9b84815a49026d4ede996277; 688c0c2b0b976d2f470489c490dcfb019a56abb5; 798158061224628313e077c9dc9ec1fadfa5ac6f; df07b4d5c9a46b16763825771f6a56750d0d4a7f; 9b761e220fca8e90956c19fecab7c6b5a65075f3; 3e3fc6e2745307203c2e662e6401e56898ddc7ab; 318453fbbbcdce11895b86e2b297f9c8c6ab875e; b4dbf6747d3c70546d1cb7b0375fc8e8c30809bb; a73cfbfe876726f4131dc32a00346479456a4de2; f79b6c103243117863cd83b50602e7937232fbb6; cd2579328a0325e7d3c94177b94f6f410a6cffca; 5479447ac07b7c904042ef0e57e9c1751267182d; 0e8ba3c23928883bef0b0f9e413ec2846d26c88c; d54ab0d719f2e8edf037cf06b3474aeaf53cb750; e6c41bb9a9c2bb588c5c15607d80bb152eb0c91d; 349fee12b9a3dce46031f138fdaa9863cda8ecc8; e7c08529e153c747c55acadc92aeada358180110; 236c5a08fb8cabeaccae59c6c14b2ac2361bb959; ec6ee142635173c646955dcfd5ad03b8b2bada65; eae97fb7c27ecafa785bc67dce5c0a9f211c3bb4; 2bf146ee322595683dfbf72d2cfdc775bc515f1c; 2c82c8e220c862ac1400cf68f9d77bf7cb9a3522; 0286dd67894e11be7d0621d846f6170deede47d9; 04bd8cf7b4df8b1812e4eb49f91c60b4fac79470; 620834abdadda670f517d8640db753c850028cd1; e68e8d8f9eb4f15f80c75835ff8059ccb287e06d; 37c2f613658f6d53742e46b3fc5b8cd802c334c1; 76ea797417585f91cabece2c43f3e9fc0d0822f4; 8445191335887319527f7e13b2193b1c1c23779a; 1085508e56cf03ce67b60c0bc2fcd1a46a8864a2,Toxicology,227 1-2,"

8d7efe026cf1d9e4ef5f6553ba1e902405240253,Candidate gene analysis suggests a role for fatty acid biosynthesis and regulation of the complement system in the etiology of age-related maculopathy.,"Age-related maculopathy (ARM) is a leading cause of visual impairment in elderly Americans and is a complex genetic disorder. Hypothesized pathways for the etiology of ARM include cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism and transport, extracellular matrix integrity, oxidative stress and inflammatory/immunologic processes. This study investigates 21 polymorphisms within 15 candidate genes whose products function within these pathways by performing family and case-control genetic association studies using clearly affected familial cases (n=338 families, 796 individuals), clearly affected, unrelated sporadic cases (n=196) and clearly unaffected, unrelated controls (n=120). Two genes demonstrated significant association with ARM status. A Met299Val variant in the elongation of very long chain fatty acids-like 4 (ELOVL4) gene was significantly associated with ARM in the case-control allele (P=0.001), case-control genotype (P=0.001) and case-control family (P<0.0001) tests. A Tyr402His variant in exon 9 in the complement factor H (CFH) gene was also significantly associated with ARM in the case-control allele (P<0.0001), case-control genotype (P<0.0001) and case-control family (P<0.0001) tests. All of these results remain significant after adjusting for false discovery rates to control for the impact of multiple testing. In addition, the CFH variant appears to play a role in exudative and atrophic disease, whereas the ELOVL4 variant may play a greater role in exudative disease in our population. These results support a potential role for multiple pathways in the etiology of ARM, including pathways involved with fatty acid biosynthesis and the complement system.",2005,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yvette P.

f0cc843f553d2da70a9555f3b9ea1b0542005ba9,Surpassing 10â€‰000 identified and quantified proteins in a single run by optimizing current LC-MS instrumentation and data analysis strategy.,"Comprehensive proteome quantification is crucial for a better understanding of underlying mechanisms of diseases. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has become the method of choice for comprehensive proteome quantification due to its power and versatility. Even though great advances have been made in recent years, full proteome coverage for complex samples remains challenging due to the high dynamic range of protein expression. Additionally, when studying disease regulatory proteins, biomarkers or potential drug targets are often low abundant, such as for instance kinases and transcription factors. Here, we show that with improvements in chromatography and data analysis the single shot proteome coverage can go beyond 10â€‰000 proteins in human tissue. In a testis cancer study, we quantified 11â€‰200 proteins using data independent acquisition (DIA). This depth was achieved with a false discovery rate of 1% which was experimentally validated using a two species test. We introduce the concept of hybrid libraries which combines the strength of direct searching of DIA data as well as the use of large project-specific or published DDA data sets. Remarkably deep proteome coverage is possible using hybrid libraries without the additional burden of creating a project-specific library. Within the testis cancer set, we found a large proportion of proteins in an altered expression (in total: 3351; 1453 increased in cancer). Many of these proteins could be linked to the hallmarks of cancer. For example, the complement system was downregulated which helps to evade the immune response and chromosomal replication was upregulated indicating a dysregulated cell cycle.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jan Muntel"", ids = ""4320771""); list(name = ""Tejas Gandhi"", ids = ""50100038""); list(name = ""Lynn Verbeke"", ids = ""147380976""); list(name = ""Oliver M Bernhardt"", ids = ""8314331""); list(name = ""Tobias Treiber"", ids = ""1380931580""); list(name = ""Roland Bruderer"", ids = ""6479981""); list(name = ""Lukas Reiter"", ids = ""1969450"")",ae4c90f9c3fa154d2d970272adbc6120faf23e20; 864402adfae3cc0f441f2ee32e02f84e76d75953; c784e6b9680aef6bd839cac47e04f5e8df3a86b4,821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6,Molecular omics,,
0f3fd1d3874bbd28c2446a57b20769f311120c80,Hippocampal alterations and functional correlates in adolescents and young adults with congenital heart disease.,"There is a high prevalence of neurodevelopmental impairments in individuals living with congenital heart disease (CHD) and the neural correlates of these impairments are not yet fully understood. Recent studies have shown that hippocampal volume and shape differences may provide unique biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders. The hippocampus is vulnerable to early life injury, especially in populations at risk for hypoxemia or hemodynamic instability such as in neonates with CHD. We compared hippocampal gray and white matter volume and morphometry between youth born with CHD (n = 50) aged 16-24 years and healthy peers (n = 48). We also explored whether hippocampal gray and white matter volume and morphometry are associated with executive function and self-regulation deficits. To do so, participants underwent 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging and completed the self-reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult version. We found that youth with CHD had smaller hippocampal volumes (all statistics corrected for false discovery rate; qâ€‰<â€‰0.05) as compared to controls. We also observed significant smaller surface area bilaterally and inward displacement on the left hippocampus predominantly on the ventral side (qâ€‰<â€‰0.10) in the CHD group that were not present in the controls. Left CA1 and CA2/3 were negatively associated with working memory (pâ€‰<â€‰.05). Here, we report, for the first-time, hippocampal morphometric alterations in youth born with CHD when compared to healthy peers, as well as, structure-function relationships between hippocampal volumes and executive function. These differences may reflect long lasting alterations in brain development specific to individual with CHD.",2019,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Kimberly Fontes"", ids = ""116181741""); list(name = ""Charles V.

Chem. 29(2005) 47-54]","Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were used to detect chromosomal regions with DNA copy number alterations. Current statistical methods for microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) analysis generally assume certain relationships among adjacent markers on the same chromosome, and these assumptions may be questionable. For an SNP-array-based CGH study, multiple normal reference SNP arrays were collected. In order to utilize these normal reference SNP arrays, we derived an empirical distribution of signal ratios for each SNP marker. With an assumed threshold value for the overall error rate control and the defined signal ratio ranges for chromosomal amplification and deletion, we proposed a procedure to identify chromosomal alteration regions based on several bootstrapped one-sample t-tests and the false discovery rate control. When we have multiple arrays for different individuals with the same disease, our method can also be used to detect SNP markers for chromosomal alteration regions that are common among these individuals. We applied our method to a published SNP array data set for breast carcinoma cell lines. For an individual with breast cancer, numerous chromosomal alteration regions were identified. Compared to results of previous studies, our method identified more chromosomal alteration regions, with some being implicated in the literature to harbor genes associated with breast cancer. For multiple cancer arrays, our results suggested the existence of common chromosomal alteration regions. However, a high proportion of false positives also indicated that genetic variations among different individuals with breast cancer can be present.",2005,Computer Science; Biology,"list(name = ""Yinglei Lai"", ids = ""37943518""); list(name = ""Hongyu Zhao"", ids = ""145400499"")",,,Comput.

f015ded964c08686b8fd817a73773711632bbab6,Reversible Changes of Brain Perfusion SPECT for Carbon Monoxide Poisoning-Induced Severe Akinetic Mutism.,"PURPOSE
This study aimed to characterize changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients who experienced carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and subsequently developed severe delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) with akinetic mutism. We determined whether these changes were reversible in parallel with improvements in neuropsychological function in response to treatment, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy.


METHODS
Patients who developed severe DNS with akinetic mutism after acute CO intoxication between 2007 and 2011 were enrolled. Tc-ECD brain SPECT findings were compared between the patients with severe akinetic mutism and age-matched control subjects to characterize the pattern of rCBF. Perfusion SPECT was correlated with clinical outcomes after treatment with statistical parametric mapping (SPM8); the height threshold was P < 0.01 at peak level, and the corrected false discovery rate was P < 0.05 at the cluster level.


RESULTS
Seven patients with akinetic mutism were analyzed. All patients had neurological symptoms caused by acute CO exposure, and all recovered to nearly normal daily function after initial treatments. In all cases, after a ""lucid interval,"" DNS progressed to akinetic mutism. The SPECT images acquired at the onset of akinetic mutism demonstrated variable hypoperfusion in frontal-temporal-parietal regions, with the greatest severity in the left temporal-parietal regions. In parallel, we performed functional neuropsychiatric tests. After treatment, the brain SPECT showed significantly fewer hypoperfusion regions, and neuropsychiatric tests showed dramatically improved function.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrated both cerebral cortical and subcortical injuries in patients with CO-induced akinetic mutism. Improvement in rCBF correlated well with functional recovery after treatment.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shao-yuan Chen"", ids = ""48847714""); list(name = ""Chun-Chieh Lin"", ids = ""7528575""); list(name = ""Yi-Te Lin"", ids = ""49418470""); list(name = ""Chung-Ping Lo"", ids = ""82515489""); list(name = ""Chen-Hsu Wang"", ids = ""3220330""); list(name = ""Yu-Ming Fan"", ids = ""5980934"")",8d89d0c1f2f3e37096e67e511ac042d3a5344b1d; 1761869f8867c54443827efc2d4a1f18a7460c2c,ecba274bdd8987c6d156e1062c9cdf55f26b22ae; cf4a0cf7dd0a31abf666f185af7467f125e0707b; a510743120152dfc30396e9890f825c17493acea; a52abfc2161038821057a283582a630c671b65df; 26ced71b06997b4751716b532f243b80fcefc158; 0ca0ad3a4e51fe57b463f65020f7875992b81293; e75bf62005c6f691f61768cfbf24b6454da5292b; d72b67e117394cf01e3d4e456a85700ad660105f; 9fde8adf950ec89309e737e54a6248fdb02d62fa; b71ed0d90b49565916fc44da80423a85afd53aca; ca56f263eadd68521e5997f2a16979b6e50818c3; cf0b8ae26f00b1b5834f0c01e7cf3e42b17dc354; 2e72d8d6edf67436354866a459aa8257f5bbbf38; b3123e092182d3d977b1ce66a3d2dd09e3051ca6; bc8d8cd1c12a267144d6da84d4cf090987864c77; f3b9bccf05acca6597afe9b638e1356e7254f1a7; 17ffbd1c9950dc573cd5ee474673e3c67aa759a5; cec4a0ef3cc089fe9d78698fda113ccfd3b5a266; 2f330fd0d53976bd977888ff7c2672661cbbf741,Clinical nuclear medicine,41 5,"

b858125e07e24108c4d533fd1ab711a701c5ed6b,RNAz 2.0: Improved Noncoding RNA Detection,"RNAz is a widely used software package for de novo detection of structured noncoding RNAs in comparative genomics data. Four years of experience have not only demonstrated the applicability of the approach, but also helped us to identify limitations of the current implementation. RNAz 2.0 provides significant improvements in two respects: (1) The accuracy is increased by the systematic use of dinucleotide models. (2) Technical limitations of the previous version, such as the inability to handle alignments with more than six sequences, are overcome by increased training data and the usage of an entropy measure to represent sequence similarities. RNAz 2.0 shows a significantly lower false discovery rate on a dinucleotide background model than the previous version. Separate models for structural alignments provide an additional way to increase the predictive power.

With this automated image analysis technique, differences in vascularity between normal and pathologic pregnancies may be observed. The algorithm was validated using a computer-generated image phantom and applied retrospectively in 143 patients. The following features from the PD data were recorded: The number of spiral artery jets into the inter-villous space, total geometric and PD area. These were automatically measured at discrete millimeter distances from the UPI. Differences in features were compared with pregnancy outcomes: Pre-eclamptic versus normal, all small-for-gestational age (SGA) to appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) patients and AGA versus SGA in normotensives (Mann-Whitney). The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used (false discovery rate 10%) for multiple comparison testing. Features decreased with increasing distance from the UPI (Kruskal-Wallis test; pâ€‰<0.001). At 2- 3â€‰mm from the UPI, all features were smaller in pre-eclamptic compared with normal patients and for some in SGA compared with AGA patients (pâ€‰<0.05). For AGA versus SGA in normotensive patients, no significant differences were found. Number of jets measured at 2-5â€‰mm from the UPI did not vary because of the position of the placenta in the uterus (ANOVA; pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). This method provides a new in-vivo imaging tool for examining spiral artery development through pregnancy. Size and number of entrances of blood flow into the UPI could potentially be used to identify high-risk pregnancies and may provide a new imaging biomarker for placental insufficiency.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Gordon N.

eb83a5e5c5cffd0fd53aecd5c803a1ea97d359de,Chemotherapy-induced changes of cerebral activity in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral white matter in diffusion tensor imaging,"While chemotherapy related cognitive disorder has been described in many studies, but we still lack relatively reliable and objective diagnostic tools, and there are few similar studies in Asian patients. We recruited Asian breast cancer patients to perform a cohort study to uncover chemotherapy related cognitive disorder by using resting-state functioning magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) and magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) combined with neuropsychologic assessments. This is the first prospective study which combines RS-fMRI and DTI to detect chemotherapy related cognitive disorder. The neuropsychologic tests and MRI were performed before and after the chemotherapy. The healthy controls were tested at matched times. The chemotherapy-treated group performed worse on memory and we found significant changes in the cerebellum, right orbitofrontal area, right middle and superior temporal gyrus, right subcentral area, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and precentral gyrus in RS-fMRI after chemotherapy. We found changes in the fornix and superior fronto-occipital fasciculus with DTI. There was a correlation between some cognitive function and MRI measurements in the correlation analysis, but it was not significant after false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing corrections. The results indicate that RS-fMRI and DTI may be a prospective application for assessing chemotherapy related cognitive disorder.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Caiqin Mo"", ids = ""16609143""); list(name = ""Hailong Lin"", ids = ""3390402""); list(name = ""Fangmeng Fu"", ids = ""2382285""); list(name = ""Lin Lin"", ids = ""145541094""); list(name = ""Jie Zhang"", ids = ""1698586""); list(name = ""Meng Huang"", ids = ""144372792""); list(name = ""Chuan Wang"", ids = ""1739464""); list(name = ""Yunjing Xue"", ids = ""35061909""); list(name = ""Q.

739a16a818bb82059328645b53e7ba825c3f3812,Perturbation-based gene regulatory network inference to unravel oncogenic mechanisms,"The gene regulatory network (GRN) of human cells encodes mechanisms to ensure proper functioning. However, if this GRN is dysregulated, the cell may enter into a disease state such as cancer. Understanding the GRN as a system can therefore help identify novel mechanisms underlying disease, which can lead to new therapies. Reliable inference of GRNs is however still a major challenge in systems biology. To deduce regulatory interactions relevant to cancer, we applied a recent computational inference framework to data from perturbation experiments in squamous carcinoma. GRNs were inferred using several methods, and the false discovery rate was controlled by the NestBoot framework. We developed a novel approach to assess the predictiveness of inferred GRNs against validation data, despite the lack of a gold standard. The best GRN was significantly more predictive than the null model, both in crossvalidated benchmarks and for an independent dataset of the same genes under a different perturbation design. It agrees with many known links, in addition to predicting a large number of novel interactions, a subset of which were experimentally validated. The inferred GRN captures regulatory interactions central to cancer-relevant processes and thus provides mechanistic insights that are useful for future cancer research. Data available at GSE125958. Inferred GRNs and inference statistics available at https://dcolin.shinyapps.io/CancerGRN/ Software available at https://bitbucket.org/sonnhammergrni/genespider/src/BFECV/ Keywords: cellular regulation, gene regulatory network inference, oncogenic mechanism Author Summary Cancer is the second most common cause of death globally, and although cancer treatments have improved in recent years, we need to understand how regulatory mechanisms are altered in cancer to combat the disease efficiently. By applying gene perturbations and inference of gene regulatory networks to 40 genes known or suspected to have a role in cancer, we deduce their underlying regulatory interactions. Using a recent computational framework for inference together with a novel method for cross validation, we infer a reliable regulatory model of this system in a completely data driven manner, not reliant on literature or priors.

8c7e3f40ac530f6437cf1e67356134337f3ed182,Autologous Expanded Natural Killer Cells As a New Therapeutic Option for High-Risk Myeloma,"Abstract 2918 Natural killer cells (NK) have the unique ability to kill target cells without priming. While their therapeutic potential against various malignancies is becoming more apparent, it has been restricted to the allogeneic setting; NK cells are inhibited by autologous targets by engaging killer immunoglobulin-like receptors with their ligands. Another major challenge to the clinical utility of NK cells is obtaining a sufficient number of NK cells for infusion. Co-culture of blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) with the leukemic cell line K562, genetically modified to express membrane-bound IL15 and the co-stimulatory molecule 41BBL (K562mbIL15-41BBL) in the presence of IL2 results in robust expansion and activation of NK cells. To determine if NK cells derived from myeloma (MM) patients can be used therapeutically in the autologous setting, we explored the expansion of NK cells from MM patients, their gene expression profiles (GEP), and their ability to kill autologous and allogeneic MM cells from high-risk patients in vitro and in vivo , and compared these to NK cells from healthy donors (HD). PBMNC from MM patients (N=30) co-cultured with irradiated K562mbIL15-41BBL cells expanded a median of 351 fold (range20â€“10, 430), comparable to the expansion of HD-derived NK cells (N=15, median 803, range 127â€“1, 727; p=0.5). GEP of MM non-exp-NK differed from HD non-exp-NK in the expression of only one gene ( PRKCi ), underexpessed in MM (false discovery rate (FDR) âˆ’10 ). GEP of exp-NK cells from both MM patients and HD was very different from non-exp-NK cells (8 pairs each, 10, 639 differentially overexpressed and 26, 057 underexpressed probe sets, FDR The anti-MM activity of allogeneic and autologous exp-NK cells was further examined in vivo . NOD/SCID/IL2R Î³-null mice were implanted subcutaneously with a human fetal bone, and primary MM cells or luciferase-transfected OPM2 MM cell line were engrafted into the bone. The tumor burden was determined by ELISA for human Ig and/or bio-imaging. The mice were randomized to control and exp-NK treatment groups. A total of 160 Ã—10 6 exp-NK cells, in 4 doses 48 hrs apart, were injected in the exp-NK treatment group via tail vein injection. The mice were administered 1000U of IL2 subcu daily to support the NK cells. The mice were bled on days 7, 14, 21 & 28 for the assessment of human Ig by ELISA and enumerating circulating NK cells by flow cytometry. Exp-NK treated mice had a significantly reduced MM burden by ELISA (p in vivo . Exp-NK cells trafficked to MM tumors and persisted in the myelomatous hu bone microenvironment for 4 weeks. The anti-MM activity of autologous exp-NK cells is exciting and avails a new therapeutic avenue for patients with GEP-defined high-risk disease. A phase II clinical trial of allogeneic and autologous exp-NK cell therapy for relapsed/refractory high-risk MM is in progress at our institution.

ecb16ebdc61d8321c2245b3cffafafa31bca6780,An Efficient Approach to Screening Epigenome-Wide Data,"Screening cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) DNA methylation sites in association with some covariate(s) is desired due to high dimensionality. We incorporate surrogate variable analyses (SVAs) into (ordinary or robust) linear regressions and utilize training and testing samples for nested validation to screen CpG sites. SVA is to account for variations in the methylation not explained by the specified covariate(s) and adjust for confounding effects. To make it easier to users, this screening method is built into a user-friendly R package, ttScreening, with efficient algorithms implemented. Various simulations were implemented to examine the robustness and sensitivity of the method compared to the classical approaches controlling for multiple testing: the false discovery rates-based (FDR-based) and the Bonferroni-based methods. The proposed approach in general performs better and has the potential to control both types I and II errors. We applied ttScreening to 383,998 CpG sites in association with maternal smoking, one of the leading factors for cancer risk.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Meredith A Ray"", ids = ""32592432""); list(name = ""Xin Tong"", ids = ""50655060""); list(name = ""Gabrielle A Lockett"", ids = ""6682638""); list(name = ""Hongmei Zhang"", ids = ""30133375""); list(name = ""Wilfried J J Karmaus"", ids = ""143707426"")",1e94b1ca020ff363b5b5c1c9da776db6b4a32045; 013e6b920dc0b5f1918eb83ddd5063f281f88535; 94dc8dc74079c17d7b4bfcfd7620d1b740b6e64d; 76932d6493015f14d0af7c68e575ddb0799ef02e,8d3a67293ee18039f4bd579c03f255409299c41f; 1f9a6a182c1755bbf4c0c7dc89033b8881f6ffc1; 00fc4db14a7ccc6c2b003d8b74f7feb202b541dc; bca451df3cdfd544611cf6186e99ca991c61712b; 51cc6d2a351e417b6dfe958844a3acd3194dc347; d5b994d17ba5dc4e8bbe9c25726f2e8fe7756ad2; 8e49ee285c18ec75570f1333fec88b44ec5b126e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; dc791b8176fee4f218a960990c54946696d6f35d; 4cd95cfb723f0647b96851608df02bfc47fb40c4; f9e02232a145ba69c37eeaa331a58510c05a1563; d6c0ac4225604fb79e9bc03e40d19cfaddc0134b; b29902ed83a39e7650f79db9e164eb54ff24df3c; f5479a6ee459bafcc3ac169a03ff684141db60d7; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; f1bcbe5845406cf32742e8d2219498c23337f9a5; aa6246b2150acb460e75b068a0136ac33bc868fb; 8ae1392e63ba3d5d03a4094d88272133bba2b7d7; 3a91ed01cf0f1c91ff815b95c20003db85bde891; 520c3f3937a32dfd2c5483f402913844e4e9e39e; 70fb975ef62e726e6825b83e77764bd3364c4246,BioMed Research International,2016,
c068a50eb6d1d5df437a825df57a512d608cce69,A practical and powerful method to control the generalized family wise error rate in multiple testing,"1. SUMMARY In a multiple testing setting, the investigator is faced with choosing what error to control and what method to use in controlling that error. Considerations include the assumptions that are made for each method and if the assumptions are acceptable in that setting. Failure to acknowledge these considerations can lead to drastically misleading results. Our recent study showed that, in applications where reduced multiplicity is encountered, the widely used Benjamini and Hochbergâ€™s (BH) false discovery rate (FDR) analysis is less robust than approaches controlling the number of false positives. In this manuscript we assess the current methods to control the probability of committing a flxed number of false positives and provide a new method. We provide theoretical proof that our proposed approach, KBIN, is more powerful than alternative approaches. We also conduct simulations and real data studies to evaluate the proposed flnding. We expect that the KBIN method has promising applications in biomarker settings where the goal is to choose a set of signiflcant biomarkers from among a panel of potential putative biomarkers.",2009,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jefirey C.

2f317f9f0532a41ff7380423607e9528fab140db,Hit selection with false discovery rate control in genome-scale RNAi screens,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a modality in which small double-stranded RNA molecules (siRNAs) designed to lead to the degradation of specific mRNAs are introduced into cells or organisms. siRNA libraries have been developed in which siRNAs targeting virtually every gene in the human genome are designed, synthesized and are presented for introduction into cells by transfection in a microtiter plate array. These siRNAs can then be transfected into cells using high-throughput screening (HTS) methodologies. The goal of RNAi HTS is to identify a set of siRNAs that inhibit or activate defined cellular phenotypes. The commonly used analysis methods including median +/- kMAD have issues about error rates in multiple hypothesis testing and plate-wise versus experiment-wise analysis. We propose a methodology based on a Bayesian framework to address these issues. Our approach allows for sharing of information across plates in a plate-wise analysis, which obviates the need for choosing either a plate-wise or experimental-wise analysis. The proposed approach incorporates information from reliable controls to achieve a higher power and a balance between the contribution from the samples and control wells. Our approach provides false discovery rate (FDR) control to address multiple testing issues and it is robust to outliers.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaohua Douglas Zhang"", ids = ""40241127""); list(name = ""Pei Fen Kuan"", ids = ""34864653""); list(name = ""Marc Ferrer"", ids = ""144585745""); list(name = ""Xiaohua Shu"", ids = ""48207236""); list(name = ""Yingxue Cathy Liu"", ids = ""46398338""); list(name = ""Adam Gates"", ids = ""47544661""); list(name = ""Priya Kunapuli"", ids = ""4105266""); list(name = ""Erica M.

97c1e2e8c4ccda3fbe013b17bbece4da698300b2,Transcriptome Analysis of Epithelioma Papulosum Cyprini Cells Infected by Reovirus Isolated from Allogynogenetic Silver Crucian Carp,"The present study aimed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and major signal transduction pathways that were related to the immune response of epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells to reoviruses isolated from allogynogenetic silver crucian carp. The study also lays a theoretical foundation for the pathogenesis and immunity of the reovirus, which is helpful to the breeding of cyprinids fish. Reovirus infected and uninfected EPC cells were analyzed by using a new-generation high-throughput sequencing technology. DEGs were identified, annotated, and classified, and the signal pathways involved in the response to reovirus infection were identified by using bioinformatics tool. The data were assembled into 92,101 contigs with an average length of 835.24 bp and an N50 value of 1432 nt. Differential expression analysis of all the genes identified 3316 DEGs at a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.01 and a fold-change of â‰¥3, of which 1691 were upregulated genes, 1625 were downregulated, and about 305 were immune-related genes. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis resulted in the annotation of 3941 GO terms, including 2719 biological processes (37,810 unigenes), 376 cell components (7943 unigenes), and 846 molecular functions (11,750 unigenes). KEGG metabolic pathway analysis matched the DEGs from pre-and post-infection EPC cells to 193 pathways, of which 35 were immune-related, including the Toll-like receptor, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and the JAK-STAT signaling pathways.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Cui-Yu Ba"", ids = ""48080908""); list(name = ""Xiao-Yan Du"", ids = ""50015852""); list(name = ""Peijun Zhang"", ids = ""50264852""); list(name = ""Ping Chen"", ids = ""46468648""); list(name = ""Ya-nan Cai"", ids = ""3293039""); list(name = ""Yuehong Li"", ids = ""47002505"")",,7deeea56bc74c6d4f3be66f99fc89689aaae38cc; 1d1ac82e26771cf16c6c59f3d0ded625efb8dc17; 747760bbc8f5b539fedba21619f17761485db2da; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 964404598b566ba2aea0c098199901d3092496ff; b473df03eaf6a2f09733692916c3aa6771624a64; 7ec301ab21abb290a42a56fa6c3718be2a27e295; acba0f199329095c712234d29d9e0dfcbda63e9f; 253fba2a2b4060c4adf47f625764182e67420334; 5b486fb44c868fe6718b5d871955f60836db3850; 8a8babcd688b82323b9da4f6c06a413494cc4bbb; 72e2a9c6937c9a99cb65db0e8c57f2852213e54b; 2615097c06a257afc7b488147995feea06e242f3; a5bf02902402d6c7b3c3791d01cd4c621d390547; 6f469ec0a2fef6fd65309a02cc931026177ddfb2; 3af364c2b527024a2502f002455c54f582140ba3; 5470f5d884c606e806dad4577783ef71567f9bb6; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; 4667ad4302254f67ef8c831ede8e4cd8d0709715; 5dfdee1a2ae5e3c0198ed6bacf73d318e35a2f40; 2d0ce334eab8d01b2b3f7a7f8cfbb892a4273a7d; 96b2e7b012bd4fbd4d56c899ef447ebdd8246950; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; 78ce0c149860363bbbe34306c75a4454ad23828d; 0d28f6e79581f7b0c28e05eb3d3ad428cc95204d; 9118f8edaeff93a2cb2a4a9a7d93a6669db5d360; 62f5ffb09a4c9543509c38f005b9c6eb308c6974; 955fe5b0eb5e9fefab7bf21dede20e1285dca410; f58f995e8cf0068e72543a6960caf920491b69d5; 788b43b7c62b497cf69b31544c6f81c6f4856d42; a36b70ce62752f1fbf96961f126dbb0618685b69; 825f8fd395d5951cb1ec493d706e1541ec159009; 447bf5edc72aa9b8c96f841ff11e8f47e89d2ec4; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 6950f8c2e6fbd0fd9e02c78ff6b1baf6856113ec; 2d06dc6423ea938389f07b53a6ed5e73929342af; 92be58063ed22b79c7575b66176554732a38315b; 68da78c5d5d88a84899e1520eb4ab2e61489599c; d16c72ba11ba9ee16bc65ae6c2917a40541b36d0; 0e2fe165dc627220cc711e1e03b8bea599112884; 0141c5e6f271f98722904c30d3ae9fd348bd7204; 559dd958ab2613eef452c7d12949bd528f52b043; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; cc3dfc835ce68ed51a5477fe33d272b4e77800fd,Viruses,10,

Several tools exist for detecting differential transcript isoform usage (DTU) from aligned or assembled RNA-seq data, but few exist for DTU detection from alignment-free RNA-seq quantifications. We present the an R package that identifies DTU transcriptome-wide directly from RATs, transcript abundance estimates. is unique in applying bootstrapping RATs to estimate the reliability of detected DTU events and shows good performance at all replication levels (median false positive fraction < 0.05). We compare to two existing DTU tools, & using RATs DRIM-Seq SUPPA2, two publicly available simulated RNA-seq datasets and a published human RNA-seq dataset, in which 248 genes have been previously identified as displaying significant DTU. RATs with default threshold values on the simulated Human data has a sensitivity of 0.55, a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.71 and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.04, outperforming both other tools. Applying the same thresholds for results in a SUPPA2 higher sensitivity (0.61) but poorer FDR performance (0.33). RATs and DRIM-seq use different methods for measuring DTU effect-sizes complicating the comparison of results between these tools, however, for a likelihood-ratio threshold of 30, has similar FDR performance to DRIM-Seq (0.06), but worse sensitivity (0.47). These differences persist for the RATs simulated drosophila dataset. On the published human RNA-seq dataset the greatest agreement between the tools tested is 53%, observed between and .

Traditional genetics software such as PLINK and HelixTree lacks the ability to model longitudinal phenotype data. This talk will describe the use of Stata for a longitudinal genetic association study from the early stages of data checking (allele frequencies and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), modeling of individual SNPs, the use of false discovery rates to control for the large number of comparisons, exporting and importing data through PHASE for haplotype reconstruction, selection of tagSNPs in Stata, and the analysis of haplotypes.

cfcb17a917003834336ce212ca228960e670aed6,Elevated expression of S100A8 and S100A9 correlates with resistance to the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in AML,"The selective B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (BCL-2) protein antagonist venetoclax (ABT-199) is an effective treatment for elderly unfit acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, particularly in combination with low-dose cytarabine or a hypomethylating agent [1]. Nevertheless, not all AML patients respond to venetoclax-based therapy and many responding patients eventually become resistant. The identification of molecular indicators of venetoclax sensitivity and primary resistance is therefore important to distinguish patients who would benefit from venetoclax-based therapy, monitor resistance to treatment, and design novel combinatorial therapies that can overcome resistance. Besides expression levels of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, very little is known about the determinants of venetoclax sensitivity and resistance [2, 3]. Studies suggest that AML patients with a mutation to IDH1/2, SRSF2, or ZRSR2 are likely to respond to venetoclax [4â€“6], while patients with a mutation to the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11 or an internal tandem duplication to FLT3 are likely to be resistant [6]. Several preclinical studies have investigated promising combinations to overcome venetoclax resistance in AML, including inhibition of MCL-1 [7], Janus-activated kinase 1/2 (JAK1/2) [8], and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) [9]. In this study, we aimed to identify molecular indicators for primary resistance to venetoclax and potential combination therapies to sensitize AML cells to venetoclax treatment. Based on RNA sequence-derived gene expression profiles and ex vivo drug sensitivity data of AML patient cells (n= 32), linear regression analysis revealed 601 genes significantly associated with venetoclax response (false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05). Out of these genes, 58.1% (349/601) were negatively associated and 41.9% (252/601) positively associated with venetoclax response. The positively associated genes included five HOX family genes, namely, HOXB5, HOXB6, HOXB7, HOXB8, and HOXB9, in line with our previous findings [5]. In contrast, a subcluster of 29 genes had a strong negative association with venetoclax response (Fig. 1). Among these genes were three S100 family genes, S100A6, S100A8, and S100A9 (FDR <0.05, Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, S100A8 expression is known to be a poor prognostic indicator in AML and elevated expression of the heterodimer S100A8/ S100A9 was previously reported to cause glucocorticoid resistance in MLL rearranged infant acute lymphoid leukemia cells [10]. Moreover, S100A8 and S100A9 are known to induce inflammatory responses and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [11]. Intriguingly, pathway analysis showed involvement of many venetoclax resistance-associated genes with immune system and inflammation-related responses (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S2). To follow-up on these findings, we investigated the association of gene expression and drug response with somatic nonsynonymous mutations. A cooccurrence of venetoclax resistance with S100A8 and S100A9 overexpression and TET2 mutations (P < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. S2) was observed. Interestingly, TET2 mutations have been connected with chemokine production and activation of inflammatory pathways [12], indicating These authors contributed equally: Riikka Karjalainen, Minxia Liu",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Riikka Karjalainen"", ids = ""39955465""); list(name = ""Minxia Liu"", ids = ""49354267""); list(name = ""Ashwini Kumar"", ids = ""47311164""); list(name = ""Liye He"", ids = ""3150986""); list(name = ""Disha Malani"", ids = ""3200678""); list(name = ""Alun Parsons"", ids = ""48901595""); list(name = ""Mika Kontro"", ids = ""3781270""); list(name = ""Olli Kallioniemi"", ids = ""1793465""); list(name = ""Kimmo Porkka"", ids = ""46701433""); list(name = ""Caroline A Heckman"", ids = ""15721458"")",,26cab3ef35b9d02b3e6b911c8c7da169b6fecb09; 74a63fc3c9a2dfe3de807d7ac010096e570412fe; 07fb5119e6083e3f13cdee5755f5a5ca6ace6c37; 350b0c951064a3c4be727e2cff2ecb7f94a23f68; 7b2787d653d6e1f87236335ecba571fa84c13844; b2fc5e2c5a8f471fbf4d00f2b6b5291df4486080; 2e848fedd7e2bac8f2e5ad305dae80154e3f1ae1; 29b92df9e158ce43d31975066ab19278df4ceb18; fae47417ce39ded752121d94847e1c58b8e23c0e; 59e2f196fab6c1fa73c30580b357b447c1eb920f; 5ca9d823e4decc6d58ef198920a55ae481f8cc46; 0eb46c01c730fb47650c443366e32ba67d6da53e; fbab6c86a96ea59c83ede884ddbadfea9636f645; afe663c963c8abed454b4e062f4111b3df271377; 55bb5b1576c3cb93f720a1eeba4a55818bf0d1ed,Leukemia,,1-5
6516030c8264558d4a986d5ecc4c5ff1ef0569d6,Evaluation of Laplace distribution-based ANOVA models applied to microarray data,"In a microarray experiment, intensity measurements tend to vary due to various systematic and random effects, which enter at the different stages of the measurement process. Common test statistics do not take these effects into account. An alternative is to use, for example, ANOVA models. In many cases, we can, however, not make the assumption of normally distributed error terms. Purdom and Holmes [6] have concluded that the distribution of microarray intensity measurements can often be better approximated by a Laplace distribution. In this paper, we consider the analysis of microarray data by using ANOVA models under the assumption of Laplace-distributed error terms. We explain the methodology and discuss problems related to fitting of this type of models. In addition to evaluating the models using several real-life microarray experiments, we conduct a simulation study to investigate different aspects of the models in detail. We find that, while the normal model is less sensitive to model misspecifications, the Laplace model has more power when the data are truly Laplace distributed.

3bd31202f6e5a62373b4744dc0e91535908bf8df,Testing Differential Networks with Applications to Detecting Gene-by-Gene Interactions.,"Model organisms and human studies have led to increasing empirical evidence that interactions among genes contribute broadly to genetic variation of complex traits. In the presence of gene-by-gene interactions, the dimensionality of the feature space becomes extremely high relative to the sample size. This imposes a significant methodological challenge in identifying gene-by-gene interactions. In the present paper, through a Gaussian graphical model framework, we translate the problem of identifying gene-by-gene interactions associated with a binary trait D into an inference problem on the difference of two high-dimensional precision matrices, which summarize the conditional dependence network structures of the genes. We propose a procedure for testing the differential network globally that is particularly powerful against sparse alternatives. In addition, a multiple testing procedure with false discovery rate control is developed to infer the specific structure of the differential network. Theoretical justification is provided to ensure the validity of the proposed tests and optimality results are derived under sparsity assumptions. A simulation study demonstrates that the proposed tests maintain the desired error rates under the null and have good power under the alternative. The methods are applied to a breast cancer gene expression study.",2015,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yin Xia"", ids = ""49289914""); list(name = ""Tianxi Cai"", ids = ""2271618""); list(name = ""Tengfei Cai"", ids = ""49282956"")",28ba70019c019e32a0abbab0c6c39fc64335db36; db11f38803b33241e227c832ea14ef77f95e8add; b5325b3db14b0f39efb8009864d78b8c51856004; 3457428e6fd6c6a093aa0675a7354c59ed44e606; 9ac63d0c044df09211dfd178d4a587523861d398; 0ce32409dc46707077d0febe1bab8a20bc9be4e8; 481903dcf077dc5c7a80790e4c2b3401373db3a5; d8f8ffc12f6acea191343fb440da87ab037209d7; 8da19d13f73898f70e7a284dba7ef240ad720e79; 3f4558a664773ae7b05245f7860bf20b863e5b1d; 20a8f0417c346b7e04aaf2d6fd239f8c10c97805; 8fcf82a9f9bec00852d8d9fc5f9753811cfa3b4d; c558db26fcd4ea18d07a6a67203f6bf7b88b7cdb; 6de25f28f84c031d066466e04576b7038b85a403; 9165b85d73188bd8d29ac1a47d8142c727ebcb92; 20df179ac839b14f112c2337240bed675bb1b6f3; 63a200655b2ab48abbfda245f2d6861b607bd175; 910b1157d35abd094963db32afc57d6f3bb6e6c1; 3091b9eabbd63840c738a23cc9ce07ef19631a05; 0c06505aa991c5db9bea3c315bdd42999a41124a; 72d2c6e05896a777064e9832eaa6feb702ff0bf8; e576415557f8fa16205b682eef79bd63e258af74; 703a443cf6f695ebf4a85ee15439275bd1c83db2,26a686f9d22d0ce475efd8cd9a7682b94414b834; b8e37c1f4d5a1338f3d04aa9e2fb9551b0b05234; 651e567ed3dc9ec50f5b92d2ebad6c0106623a92; e79074ae462caf73fa7b506562d779afbcb1f70d; 14cdc68fa5caae23722b2113161071a1fe87dff4; 0aa49f621eaf16004b6ab31a9a4eab5a29a693f7; 88c16d834b68de0fef473b9481c76dbb8850ed5e; b744f51e887f9841c049d333a84d8f0e09b43a8b; 740f1e43c7a2c172b209cadb59e62692c90c0eda; 9ecae668ad78e5ab6ef099808fea219f815cf5c4; 133e1c15ecf6bf3374d58bef2fc3a425d76eb03c; 1b37279dce5ca9606cbf62a1daf2cbc4dfecc339; 8bf6c7eef879565d2416a730e26c24536bf25a34; ecca1add4034b023048bef6277bd49326224f7d8; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; e976777c90f78878872da5e481182871cf2c35ad; 8d0cf8974fdb6e31c3c4a3f39b00fae02b0e928a; ef1bf316ce572888268aba556d8534768e8c816a; e4f8536b067127e5269316832a4733def51c399a; eb6b37554c187d256ded1608d8266bc6fbbea401; d5fb6e3eb7dead10b04d85bb395681d479b15a33; a8ce97017c6dc7d187aef5da4c934ed5c259480b; 75e72acbd9c14b177872473c1883c2dbe84daa8e; 927271c4cd46a3f748fbd4fd725ad028d25fb74d; e539e3197c95a83fa4f9e11efe168a5e86c46583; 8f324fdcbcee2756aa76d4b33979bda8c5adcab5; f3c0ad0efa1e2d6447f9e200179d3c6aa33df981; 97a3dad39601246bb779eaecf178564d986cfe55; 460697f4d329c1b0dc88a8da7652b1f02ae6312d; 4ce78588075e870a8726f19b31012ebf8491fe48; 211ee67f6f546ede6cbf9f9cb35a31435cb83605; 4958de5901f207aaadf20a3dff294926114858fa; e3abc33685260b717d4ec73df312b115a0b865d7; f44135d951fd87faeee70c1507ead99072ee3b14; 6763d70405a65b33e1c605c07a13580f9d9d9d86; ccab71dd27f5346f481c595bf84d39468e0176ad; 3522c23d90a28dce8298c79881927fae53d420a9; 3107276a535d17a3fb33f4af4df0f5b82296e85a; cb3efcd5de509f156420976977187a6311d12b6c; 0ddf2646929ce22bb189ef0e6232fcea4e5404c2,Biometrika,102 2,"

226eae820c0224163256f67e6af337303972bae8,Cerebrospinal Fluid and MRI Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Retrospective Memory Clinic-Based Study.,"BACKGROUND
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases are relatively sensitive and specific in highly curated research cohorts, but proper validation for clinical use is mostly missing.


OBJECTIVE
We studied these biomarkers in a novel memory clinic cohort with a variety of different neurodegenerative diseases.


METHODS
This study consisted of 191 patients with subjective or objective cognitive impairment who underwent neurological, CSF biomarker (AÎ²42, p-tau, and tau) and T1-weighted MRI examinations at Kuopio University Hospital. We assessed CSF and imaging biomarkers, including structural MRI focused on volumetric and cortical thickness analyses, across groups stratified based on different clinical diagnoses, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, vascular dementia, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and subjects with no evidence of neurodegenerative disease underlying the cognitive symptoms. Imaging biomarkers were also studied by profiling subjects according to the novel amyloid, tau, and, neurodegeneration (AT(N)) classification.


RESULTS
Numerous imaging variables differed by clinical diagnosis, including hippocampal, amygdalar and inferior lateral ventricular volumes and entorhinal, lingual, inferior parietal and isthmus cingulate cortical thicknesses, at a false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected threshold for significance (analysis of covariance; pâ€Š<â€Š0.005). In volumetric comparisons by AT(N) profile, hippocampal volume significantly differed (pâ€Š<â€Š0.001) between patients with normal AD biomarkers and patients with amyloid pathology.


CONCLUSION
Our analysis suggests that CSF and MRI biomarkers function well also in clinical practice across multiple clinical diagnostic groups in addition to AD, MCI, and cognitively normal groups.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Aku Kaipainen"", ids = ""52149341""); list(name = ""Olli JÃ¤Ã¤skelÃ¤inen"", ids = ""2893599""); list(name = ""Yawu Liu"", ids = ""2675350""); list(name = ""Fanni Haapalinna"", ids = ""4231734""); list(name = ""Niko NykÃ¤nen"", ids = ""103583351""); list(name = ""Ritva L.

4311371a38a2cc54f4b19b45f15e951d725544cc,Optimal Sufficient Statistics for Parametric and Non-Parametric Multiple Simultaneous Hypothesis Testing,"In multiple simultaneous hypothesis testing (MSHT), a significance thresholding function as a scalar statistic can be designed in an adaptive manner by sharing information among many tests performed simultaneously. By using such an adapted statistic, MSHT has greater detection power than tests using simple individual statistics. To systematically obtain an optimal thresholding function that maximizes the detection power in MSHT, Storey (2007) proposed a theoretical framework called the optimal discovery procedure (ODP). He also proposed an empirical estimation of the ODP thresholding function for a parametric MSHT that presupposes parametric forms of the null and alternative likelihood functions. Empirical Bayesian testing (Efron et al. 2001), which is based on a non-parametric treatment of arbitrary test statistics, has sometimes exhibited comparable power to the ODP. These two MSHT frameworks appear to be closely related but, because of differences in their approach (frequentist vs. Bayesian), the relationship is not well understood.We present the new concept of an optimal sufficient statistic that links the ODP and empirical Bayesian frameworks, and we show that the local false discovery rate based on the empirical Bayes can be an optimal thresholding function if a certain condition holds. We lay out exhaustive sets of presumptions to achieve optimal thresholding functions and show that, if an optimal thresholding function is derived for a parametric MSHT problem, it is still optimal for a more general and broader range of MSHT problems defined in a non- or semi-parametric way. A guide to designing optimal thresholding functions for general MSHT problems is thus provided by our study.",2009,,"list(name = ""Shigeyuki Oba"", ids = ""38809507""); list(name = ""Shin Ishii"", ids = ""145516720"")",,eab669a51f7a7321092998cc79150d306d708647; 58352bfc164b8b4c51d911ba648865ffd613542f; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 758b7d38db3a12cf1e00c399bd4ad88926d1007e; fd4b45dcbdca97567ef0b0a085824a5044d884d4; fce009e245d2af43003c7bf7dd34d4ecd0476a05; c0a1fb15f046e5c4017e14440cdc68eab4862d63; 98da9d46e4c442945bfd88db72be177e7a198fd3; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; 68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; 840c0cdb1f428d300cd7986d170da5f807b3d20d,The International Journal of Biostatistics,5,
e59eb1a0c197972c90730b8fb44e6de962f6e1ee,Accurate peptide fragmentation predictions allow data driven approaches to replace and improve upon proteomics search engine scoring functions,"MOTIVATION
The use of post-processing tools to maximize the information gained from a proteomics search engine is widely accepted and used by the community, with the most notable example being Percolator - a semi-supervised machine learning model which learns a new scoring function for a given dataset. The usage of such tools is however bound to the search engine's scoring scheme, which doesn't always make full use of the intensity information present in a spectrum. We aim to show how this tool can be applied in such a way that maximizes the use of spectrum intensity information by leveraging another machine learning-based tool, MS2PIP. MS2PIP predicts fragment ion peak intensities.


RESULTS
We show how comparing predicted intensities to annotated experimental spectra by calculating direct similarity metrics provides enough information for a tool such as Percolator to accurately separate two classes of PSMs. This approach allows using more information out of the data (compared to simpler intensity based metrics, like peak counting or explained intensities summing) while maintaining control of statistics such as the false discovery rate.

It is also believed to relief skin conditions accompanied by itching symptom, such as atopic dermatitis (AD) or eczema. However, the anti-eczema mechanism of action is still unclear. The aims of this syudy was toÂ  identify anti-eczema mechanism of action of N. sativa for AD using computer aided prediction and pathway analysis based on protein-chemical networks. Methods: We utilized dataset consisting chemical compounds of N. sativa from KNApSAcK. It is a comprehensive species-metabolite relationship database. Using canonical SMILES strings that encode molecular structures of each compound, we predicted the probabilities of activity (Pa) for anti-eczema effect based on PASS algorithms. The compounds with Pa >0.7 were included for pathway analysis based on protein-chemical interaction networks in STITCH database. We selected interactomes built by experimental data, gene co-expression, closest gene position, fusion, co-occurence, computational prediction, and other secondary data. Results: Thirty-five active compounds of N. sativa have been utilized and 19 of them have potential anti-eczema effects. Oleic acid and lauric acid were predicted with Pa-value of 0.947 and 0.920 for anti-eczema effect, respectively. However, only lauric acid was confirmed having a plausible mechanism of action via LY96-TLR4- PIK3R1 pathway for lipopolysaccharide receptor activity (false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.0243) and low-density lipoprotein particle receptor binding (FDR = 0.0118). Conclusion: Lauric acid in N. sativa has potential antieczema effect to prevent relaps in AD patients by controlling opportunistic bacterial infection that aggravates itching symptom in this condition.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Meidyta Sinantryana Widyaswari"", ids = ""83459926""); list(name = ""Iis Noventi"", ids = ""117536126""); list(name = ""Herdiantri Supriyana"", ids = ""1473640712"")",,6267c9c036fe0bc6dec0c448601aa156f7f0d162; 645e379b7ef44d7f49060c0d59fc6ca736cbc561; 09840a88cc14e5f4143900bf714813d02b1f7451; 36175ee08e4e67dac01da936a4d7970dad6208f8; c629f605ce1be29f8db348214c355aab9d35ffb2; cd3cda0f9b7dedeee6c3b85163f8139ce73efca5; 50c2c2093d9799a6a58063eff688037800124104; dd07dd8e7e5bfe6e57aa63ffd98cd014cd333558; e20c160dfff1e57c107d48001762f1aff9478568; 01df3ff39e65251ca704193c3fefa06ea8749d92; cec811207413642ca292bd8bc8e8fb63e40337bc; 1b2aee93202ac7a872d3c186216e6b450185b568; a81f4439b93e0e60f8facf68c9f80c0264e44077; e542694b2f3ff8cd49c86f518f4ff872d5880542; 6ae1153bba77d444cee8661026d96d1a5b11ad9f,,2,68-74

These devise techniques mainly comprises of, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and gene classification for the process of gene cancer classification.. In our work, microarray gene classification by GA with FFBNN was proposed for precise classification of genes to their corresponding gene types. To gauge the efficiency of any method it is better to compare it with existing methods. Thus, analysis is necessary for the techniques that are utilized in the gene classification process.

1272b19941aab933d792142fc41261f641c80cd6,NcDNAlign: plausible multiple alignments of non-protein-coding genomic sequences.,"Genome-wide multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are a necessary prerequisite for an increasingly diverse collection of comparative genomic approaches. Here we present a versatile method that generates high-quality MSAs for non-protein-coding sequences. The NcDNAlign pipeline combines pairwise BLAST alignments to create initial MSAs, which are then locally improved and trimmed. The program is optimized for speed and hence is particulary well-suited to pilot studies. We demonstrate the practical use of NcDNAlign in three case studies: the search for ncRNAs in gammaproteobacteria and the analysis of conserved noncoding DNA in nematodes and teleost fish, in the latter case focusing on the fate of duplicated ultra-conserved regions. Compared to the currently widely used genome-wide alignment program TBA, our program results in a 20- to 30-fold reduction of CPU time necessary to generate gammaproteobacterial alignments. A showcase application of bacterial ncRNA prediction based on alignments of both algorithms results in similar sensitivity, false discovery rates, and up to 100 putatively novel ncRNA structures. Similar findings hold for our application of NcDNAlign to the identification of ultra-conserved regions in nematodes and teleosts. Both approaches yield conserved sequences of unknown function, result in novel evolutionary insights into conservation patterns among these genomes, and manifest the benefits of an efficient and reliable genome-wide alignment package.

eb19613f0c868b45a7cfe601c0e85f1e79351ce0,Structured RNAs in the ENCODE selected regions of the human genome.,"Functional RNA structures play an important role both in the context of noncoding RNA transcripts as well as regulatory elements in mRNAs. Here we present a computational study to detect functional RNA structures within the ENCODE regions of the human genome. Since structural RNAs in general lack characteristic signals in primary sequence, comparative approaches evaluating evolutionary conservation of structures are most promising. We have used three recently introduced programs based on either phylogenetic-stochastic context-free grammar (EvoFold) or energy directed folding (RNAz and AlifoldZ), yielding several thousand candidate structures (corresponding to approximately 2.7% of the ENCODE regions). EvoFold has its highest sensitivity in highly conserved and relatively AU-rich regions, while RNAz favors slightly GC-rich regions, resulting in a relatively small overlap between methods. Comparison with the GENCODE annotation points to functional RNAs in all genomic contexts, with a slightly increased density in 3'-UTRs. While we estimate a significant false discovery rate of approximately 50%-70% many of the predictions can be further substantiated by additional criteria: 248 loci are predicted by both RNAz and EvoFold, and an additional 239 RNAz or EvoFold predictions are supported by the (more stringent) AlifoldZ algorithm. Five hundred seventy RNAz structure predictions fall into regions that show signs of selection pressure also on the sequence level (i.e., conserved elements). More than 700 predictions overlap with noncoding transcripts detected by oligonucleotide tiling arrays. One hundred seventy-five selected candidates were tested by RT-PCR in six tissues, and expression could be verified in 43 cases (24.6%).",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Stefan Washietl"", ids = ""2192601""); list(name = ""Jakob Skou Pedersen"", ids = ""2881822""); list(name = ""Jan O.

c02839262cedf1e91e90cd3c942a6757f2671c99,Establishing the molecular pathways involved in chronic allograft nephropathy for testing new noninvasive diagnostic markers.,"BACKGROUND
Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is a cause of graft loss. The multistage processes that result in CAN are poorly understood. Noninvasive assays for detecting allograft dysfunction and predicting long-term outcomes are a priority in transplantation (Tx).


METHODS
Renal tissue from kidney transplant patients (KTP) with CAN (n=11) and normal kidneys (NK; n=7) were studied using microarrays. Markers resulting from the microarray analysis (transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta, epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], angiotensinogen [AGT]) were tested in urine (Ur) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from the CAN patients (collected at the biopsy time) using reverse-transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction. Ur and PB samples from long-term KTP with stable renal function (SRF; n=20) were used as control.


RESULTS
Assuming unequal variances between CAN and NK, using a false discovery rate of 0.005, and running 1,000 of all possible permutations, 728 probe sets were differentially expressed. Genes related to fibrosis and extracellular matrix deposition (i.e., TGF-beta, laminin, gamma 2, metalloproteinases-9, and collagen type IX alpha 3) were up-regulated. Genes related to immunoglobulins, B cells, T-cell receptor, nuclear factor of activated T cells, and cytokine and chemokines receptors were also upregulated. EGFR and growth factor receptor activity (FGFR)2 were downregulated in CAN samples. AGT, EGFR, and TGF-beta levels were statistical different in urine but not in blood samples of CAN patients when compared to KTP with SRF (P<0.001, P=0.04, and P<0.001, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
Genes related to fibrosis, extracellular matrix deposition, and immune response were found up-regulated in CAN. Markers resulting from the microarray analysis were differentially expressed in Ur samples of the CAN patients and in concordance with the microarray profiles.",2007,Medicine,"list(name = ""Valeria R.

c476e3232454e79f9811bde36a137b013058d8bb,iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis of alterations in the intestine of Hu sheep under weaning stress,"When Lambs are weaned off ewe's milk, metabolic, structural, and functional changes often occur in the small intestine. Because information on the effects of weaning stress on the proteome of the intestine is limited, an animal model was established with eight pairs of twin lambs divided into artificially reared and ewe-reared groups, which was followed by proteome analysis using iTRAQ technology. Changes occurred in the morphology of the intestine and 5,338 proteins in three biological replicates with less than a 1.2% false discovery rate were identified and quantified. Among them, a subset of 389 proteins were screened as significantly up- (143) and down-regulated (246) in artificially reared compared with ewe-reared. According to Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis, the differentially expressed proteins that were strongly down-regulated were enriched in immune system processes, biological adhesion, and metabolic processes. The up-regulated proteins were enriched in gene expression, cellular biosynthetic processes, ribosome and RNA binding in response to weaning stress. A series of proteins associated with intestine morphology and immune function were identified, and levels of the mRNAs encoding these proteins were analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The results of this study increased our understanding of the response of lambs weaned off ewe's milk and helped to determine the mechanisms underlying weaning stress.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kai Cui"", ids = ""145818076""); list(name = ""Bo Wang"", ids = ""47780719""); list(name = ""Naifeng Zhang"", ids = ""4973845""); list(name = ""Yan Tu"", ids = ""143610871""); list(name = ""Tao Ma"", ids = ""145855569""); list(name = ""Qiyu Diao"", ids = ""145145557"")",ec36dba8bcd470a1cec818540c3f349de4a18b2c,a0f3dc462532d5289d5ed01071ddb3626c49e952; cffd0137b52f896b6135c27840c48ba3eec8c8a8; 20b3d0ab38dfa086d5585e76ca4b8322a886ef19; 0c74e5d29e9c677b154d07b6d569e1b20f3564e2; 3b2f9247b29f3f130c0c4f05e7a1923c1b33e633; 0d37c74bf804b42eca5640c7e3727071c0dbd101; ead31eac42ed1b6e1846b8ea8897d2d632e7569b; 16978a43db5a34ad5919195bd8f5afcd059fc95d; c7435d5cb10da494a0250362d7c00f3cb12371e4; fafc9fe4b508e20b2445b3388819102a95b7a7dd; 324e4788860d8c15a46c74eb305d7e88434390ea; 5fe4a932f7453d584f3e8fb77e6efb5cd4521f4b; 752ab84538538dd141b40f73a72784bc52793104; 57ef8199ec81cff17965869bd8b34ad313024f29; b16413433f2a36e6666325e42c96b7026dc582c5; 683e54a26476ce3f343eab9c3a975325977340e6; 7622505dfc62a1293841706afa6d622ba61b98e5; 3732d7b075653e74d50d1e25f3cbc73b37882e06; d50c67b938c60605d2166729e46212bd555c5013; f3e68606445a3c6021e8d33b67b0f21b5244e915; 99d05e6200070a15cab0c0a8e8a4a71859aa2e95; 9be77d3c0ffad890de494f4f1da70e05f01d2fc6; e15a361628ee1b9974200424148724f92fb85306; 27ed38521d2cc91140e9fae1937175d201535a99; 76c7ed447629f2f1b8eae15abdef66db78a5be84; 0c6dbd60112aa5742de2e21a548c95fe249f2c93; c2b303569a5541fe077e17848d64a79017ff307e; 672f88145e7c54b71b1f7325eb29f2de4c216ae7; 40cd95a418e57a59ece526b08aaad9c2d67a7683; 9a9c74e617e82b8532e32f993c7c3b2e3c9109bf; db61bf456fc4bf31f5dcebf85bd196ba6e8a412f,PLoS ONE,13,

We report an efficient, flexible proteomic analysis workflow pipeline that implements these techniques to control both peptide and protein false discovery rates. We demonstrate its performance by analyzing two-dimensional liquid chromatography separations of lens proteins from human, mouse, bovine, and chicken lenses. We compared the use of International Protein Index databases to UniProt databases and no-enzyme SEQUEST searches to tryptic searches. Sequences present in the International Protein Index databases allowed detection of several novel crystallins. An alternate start codon isoform of Î²A4 was found in human lens. The minor crystallin Î³N was detected for the first time in bovine and chicken lenses.

803a83becf0c19170e9d3b9fc155f072177b6c4b,Genome-wide mapping of large deletions and their population-genetic properties in dairy cattle,"Large genomic deletions are potential candidate for loss-of-function, which could be lethal as homozygote. Analysing whole genome data of 175 cattle, we report 8,480 large deletions (199â€‰bp-773â€‰KB) with an overall false discovery rate of 8.8%; 82% of which are novel compared with deletions in the dbVar database. Breakpoint sequence analyses revealed that majority (24 of 29 tested) of the deletions contain microhomology/homology at breakpoint, and therefore, most likely generated by microhomology-mediated end joining. We observed higher differentiation among breeds for deletions in some genic-regions, such as ABCA12, TTC1, VWA3B, TSHR, DST/BPAG1, and CD1D. The genes overlapping deletions are on average evolutionarily less conserved compared with known mouse lethal genes (P-value = 2.3 Ã— 10-6). We report 167 natural gene knockouts in cattle that are apparently nonessential as live homozygote individuals are observed. These genes are functionally enriched for immunoglobulin domains, olfactory receptors, and MHC classes (FDR = 2.06 Ã— 10-22, 2.06 Ã— 10-22, 7.01 Ã— 10-6, respectively). We also demonstrate that deletions are enriched for health and fertility related quantitative trait loci (2-and 1.5-fold enrichment, Fisher's P-value = 8.91 Ã— 10-10 and 7.4 Ã— 10-11, respectively).

985e2eb261bf8ce9d3fa7214119f46ee8e37d608,Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the tenomodulin gene (TNMD) in age-related macular degeneration,"PURPOSE
Tenomodulin (TNMD) is located in the X-chromosome encoding a putative angiogenesis inhibitor which is expressed in retina. Associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms of TNMD with the prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) were examined.


METHODS
Six markers covering 75% of the common sequence variation in the coding region of TNMD and 10 kb up- and downstream were genotyped in a sample consisting of 89 men and 175 women with exudative AMD, 18 men and 25 women with atrophic AMD, and 55 men and 113 women without AMD. All participants were over 65 years old and did not have diabetes mellitus. Due to the chromosomal locus, the association of genotypes with AMD was assessed genderwise.


RESULTS
Three markers, rs1155974, rs2073163, and rs7890586, were associated with a risk of AMD in women. In comparison to women with other genotypes, the women who were homozygous for the minor allele (genotypes rs1155974-TT or rs2073163-CC) had 2.6 fold (p=0.021) or 1.9 fold (p=0.067) risk for having AMD, respectively. These differences were due to the unequal prevalence of exudative AMD. In comparison to women who were homozygous for the major alleles, the women with rs1155974-TT genotype had a 2.8 fold risk (p=0.021 in additive model; p=0.022 in recessive model) for exudative AMD, and the women with rs2073163-CC genotype had a 1.8 fold risk (p=0.09 in additive model; p=0.038 in recessive model). Furthermore, women carrying the rare rs7890586-AA genotype had a significantly smaller risk for having AMD than women with the other genotypes (odds ratio 0.083; p=0.001 in recessive model), but due to the low frequency of this genotype, this finding must be interpreted cautiously. The false discovery rate was <10% for all of the aforementioned results.


CONCLUSIONS
On the basis of the putative antiangiogenic role of TNMD and the present genetic associations of TNMD with AMD in women, we suggest that TNMD could be a novel candidate gene for AMD. These results should be confirmed in further studies.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Anna-Maija Tolppanen"", ids = ""2628180""); list(name = ""Tanja Nevalainen"", ids = ""32545112""); list(name = ""Marjukka Kolehmainen"", ids = ""4964616""); list(name = ""Sanna Seitsonen"", ids = ""47495692""); list(name = ""Ilkka Immonen"", ids = ""4307468""); list(name = ""Matti Uusitupa"", ids = ""7008227""); list(name = ""Kai Kaarniranta"", ids = ""5944489""); list(name = ""Leena Pulkkinen"", ids = ""50463452"")",91a9b6e65313a6c0f6e168a1a9d5dfaf255e1413; 27ceab02020d7c314d249fb865dd335f57bbe28a; 776b51143ac06ca3fcf63c19529e1bb4ce4eb9fd; 9718607cc71d8760db3842e2a9077c9451faaf2f; aaaa2b08b3112190b0f6ee278c624544765732f4; eaa363107cf84e50921c3ac870fb3b796e97badb,49ab18c8300a2326e5d80e1f714d5461d0ed73c5; 50a76e6fec50fbf9d6a3f090f61a5b312cac09ca; c7b68bfc7374fe833ac7753b9aff84da48e02f85; 05f8592908a52d33d48f5e89b7720322d015e552; d89d6c1270d59b720a0a988cca677ab73e0c68b7; f76379eb3228a933d252eb46b3bd6038d06ee3d8; 65afc8d8b240b2aeaf8453820ee96f7c677bc414; dd1b3a3793619cec8994cc7cca10e6dee656fb7b; 9f684b469e19b7dea57c8811f7639fb5bf163dfe; 0d268c2a0242c3dde0e1ece3d2707afaaa532648; 00cd59ecbbfe6ee886d785b1ab0f6576ed1bca1e; 40939e91b7a22092fcaeaf566bcd466f6c389c8b; dd0b45aa90443db2b8c5c928e8404541c83df570; a7f843584dada7c009ec077396d1280aa6a00e02; e49ec2f4b5a4e6ff563c178658c9b98a7c0e43b4; 8bc374e57db7fb7b0bdbfbaaaee6302e9bb9a7ad; 9e8fcb12db5da41c6c166d60e5c9188286703312; a15957148ad0e1e5a26ac21b28ecc070e1f4737a; e89863a15c64dc03d5cb33ccbaf0dc1b9281ba89; 59effde26ae9e40de1d546db793f8085d614b84f; 3bb5bb134166a00086c497bc3468f0d03fb1ddd8; b19dd45847688ee7245801c8c0163156595a4b3f; 7fb957832eebc6d0b94613f72ed0b672ff58e383; 11d941a39f1903fcb301f5a05bde02e73f460020; fb1a79c5164e88c80ee839fc9c8eaafb3a89b659; c95d5eba01b0c78f778ccc3540e718caf4765275; 898dfa7df20e524f643d7dd3080b3292e80be7c3; d8499b069b1d04065295a056fa741310856c5da5; b67f88f0a0a959f70b7a0841fc40cea9d48ca618; b28df30293c94342d192583c03f8988db01a71cf; 09ca2f9805e475b5d6759646b7a10d7af97695ba; 60eaadcc43b51718930cec64d6080f5dd2a1ec22; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; c7839d9e0b7ee7094b1610382f93e1f91b942ad0; b49795dfc6a855137bcd5454c47c7cc07eae9a1e; 364aae46781ba51756d9d59d9d17cbad9ca72da0; 5d8463a9bb699291d629d1f1068d91a66badafe2; 83bf385e742e12cfd55506c2a3e41e4ec24315d1; d238aac1b4acd56ae2a6bda53be15abf847b81c0; f9c8588b874b6fc0d1289cae9b5b7c3af727e335; 126cea30bd7414fa9bd4b41897fe03e624b9fc1f; 65fffda03a54d3e810e7589c9883bafc65813da1; 84712da75f78386ef44bec6c7bf2233360398758; d616c0d6857f7623bd24cf3e220d653cb8bdc2f2; 689882d064fb3422574dc51273b1c44c4aa28c04; 9a7359082243838fd5b806e24d53ec3412039ce8; 35f2fe33eb8ebf21eed54261062b441107da52bc; 22bd0ce83558f20ba92a5dae23ad90739a3fed0a; 4ea8ded29cf0192961d9be9cf32ce3e0adfebe3d; 7bafd0c6ea63aa2aae7a841fa9ef1237d87cdf04; f63ed5b97d6246a99e24949c4c3fe35a62d0e399; 14fa5294b0750f27178486b5b9333d1e0c9c6d5e; cbbaf4b9a191d9a96f7953523ff7458eeab39075; a1f997ecbdcffd94f3887d89ebbed7a8337cc0ad; 9775e27403ccf613fcf43a017ed218fedca95bf1; fd9cb2ef657601ae394ea3ca1977d04f5f1a47f6; 6693c35382231790b639f381419b4389e3a653cb; 54cc0a846bfe42246e3a8c7102707b5ae410671f,Molecular Vision,15,762 - 770

6c525f597abf0ccfea2bd8c84d4aac2ee505590a,Using Optimal F-Measure and Random Resampling in Gene Ontology Enrichment Calculations,"Background A central question in bioinformatics is how to minimize arbitrariness and bias in analysis of patterns of enrichment in data. A prime example of such a question is enrichment of gene ontology (GO) classes in lists of genes. Our paper deals with two issues within this larger question. One is how to calculate the false discovery rate (FDR) within a set of apparently enriched ontologies, and the second how to set that FDR within the context of assessing significance for addressing biological questions, to answer these questions we compare a random resampling method with a commonly used method for assessing FDR, the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method. We further develop a heuristic method for evaluating Type II (false negative) errors to enable utilization of F-Measure binary classification theory for distinguishing â€œsignificantâ€ from â€œnon-significantâ€ degrees of enrichment. Results The results show the preferability and feasibility of random resampling assessment of FDR over the analytical methods with which we compare it. They also show that the reasonableness of any arbitrary threshold depends strongly on the structure of the dataset being tested, suggesting that the less arbitrary method of F-measure optimization to determine significance threshold is preferable. Conclusion Therefore, we suggest using F-measure optimization instead of placing an arbitrary threshold to evaluate the significance of Gene Ontology Enrichment results, and using resampling to replace analytical methods",2018,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Weihao Ge"", ids = ""15539316""); list(name = ""Zeeshan Fazal"", ids = ""2133303""); list(name = ""Eric Jakobsson"", ids = ""35126330"")",,f0d644b716661225de1c0f499eb27c4d2241b9ce; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; 030016cd282c69e8b55807ab7f657d60d2519246; 189acf33fe5d51f27b366122e29b603c6f8c6a72; e719098eb1f135302c2c1c56f8ee09c8d87e5e87; 75d74b24ec71e25eaf910c96ba3b58c86f3e476f; 2b588b189dfc022f5bb4f3c4ac7cd28220a84a2c; af2b7af47ff23290f75a48ba2fd1ad1a9aca1dde; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 34339b453bf10ca35965b18d18229e01bc772105; 5ef8284be6094d4b60571fcddbce76d3b7292623; 6d03a38c5ddb7c7cd1ceb59b28907dc918c5d83a; 5598922da04bdb14c8ff7c52738ca47194493532; b79ff82502b35738c16b42a47b7f23334fab99c8; 7a27877026d41260203e80cb2ba9a2389cc98bb0; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 13385cdae7c02326dea524bf58f4b00a4814562e; 155b044c0592dfa9f154410aa2d14b742a454772; fc30910a8bf8daa3256284580b1dfe98b32d3559; b5959ed4a1c5ad9e07fb086e4114f4574ebadc2a; fe8dca92115553710761ea1ec1464ed8019cf1f9; aba9fe2adac4d90653e18bc56eb8da227b325ab0; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 314394396fe89512af1347294945672c410e6b04; 47e0eca9f722167c3ec1e9f0ad5d48c81e83d1f8; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 3ce045b9dca7200c7ca85549b2a7520a71c47710; a2792d78d7bd427008232a007741d3347fdc2072; 189e44489209454d363e6a0e272f3c5c80bbde1b; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 37035131b0e1c693488179047fcc7ecf37fc4a95,bioRxiv,,
6f1caae9b42c5bf09c286d1d2dfb0ce3ae25763a,A method for selective enrichment and analysis of nitrotyrosine-containing peptides in complex proteome samples.,"Elevated levels of protein tyrosine nitration have been found in various neurodegenerative diseases and age-related pathologies. Until recently, however, the lack of an efficient enrichment method has prevented the analysis of this important low-level protein modification. We have developed a method that specifically enriches nitrotyrosine-containing peptides so that both nitrotyrosine peptides and specific nitration sites can be unambiguously identified with LC-MS/MS. The procedure consists of the derivatization of nitrotyrosine into free sulfhydryl groups followed by high efficiency enrichment of sulfhydryl-containing peptides with thiopropyl sepharose beads. The derivatization process includes: (1) acetylation with acetic anhydride to block all primary amines, (2) reduction of nitrotyrosine to aminotyrosine, (3) derivatization of aminotyrosine with N-Succinimidyl S-Acetylthioacetate (SATA), and (4) deprotection of S-acetyl on SATA to form free sulfhydryl groups. The high specificity of this method is demonstrated by the contrasting percentage of nitrotyrosine-derivatized peptides in the identified tandem mass spectra between enriched and unenriched samples. Global analysis of unenriched in vitro nitrated human histone H1.2, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and mouse brain homogenate samples had 9%, 9%, and 5.9% of identified nitrotyrosine-containing peptides, while the enriched samples had 91% , 62%, and 35%, respectively. Duplicate LC-MS/MS analyses of the enriched mouse brain homogenate identified 150 unique nitrated peptides covering 102 proteins with an estimated 3.3% false discovery rate.",2007,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qibin Zhang"", ids = ""3103282""); list(name = ""Wei-Jun Qian"", ids = ""144287879""); list(name = ""Tatyana V Knyushko"", ids = ""11671421""); list(name = ""Therese R.

4e3cbbd34dfb8fe9e93b6623723ac073b2261d79,Disrupted prefrontal interhemispheric structural coupling in schizophrenia related to working memory performance.,"BACKGROUND
Prominent regional cortical thickness reductions have been shown in schizophrenia. In contrast, little is known regarding alterations of structural coupling between regions in schizophrenia and how these alterations may be related to cognitive impairments in this disorder.


METHODS
T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired in 54 patients with schizophrenia and 68 healthy control subjects aged 18-55 years. Cortical thickness was compared between groups using a vertex-wise approach. To assess structural coupling, seeds were selected within regions of reduced thickness, and brain-wide cortical thickness correlations were compared between groups. The relationships between identified patterns of circuit structure disruption and cognitive task performance were then explored.


RESULTS
Prominent cortical thickness reductions were found in patients compared with controls at a 5% false discovery rate in a predominantly frontal and temporal pattern. Correlations of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with right prefrontal regions were significantly different in patients and controls. The difference remained significant in a subset of 20 first-episode patients. Participants with stronger frontal interhemispheric thickness correlations had poorer working memory performance.


CONCLUSIONS
We identified structural impairment in a left-right DLPFC circuit in patients with schizophrenia independent of illness stage or medication exposure. The relationship between left-right DLPFC thickness correlations and working memory performance implicates prefrontal interhemispheric circuit impairment as a vulnerability pathway for poor working memory performance. Our findings could guide the development of novel therapeutic interventions aimed at improving working memory performance in patients with schizophrenia.",2014,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anne L.

48c7cf806c0f7ce5b5fb7b54870ccfdbc926ed51,Plant proteogenomics: from protein extraction to improved gene predictions.,"Historically many genome annotation strategies have lacked experimental evidence at the protein level, which and have instead relied heavily on ab initio gene prediction tools, which consequently resulted in many incorrectly annotated genomic sequences. Proteogenomics aims to address these issues using mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, genomic mapping, and providing statistical significance measures such as false discovery rates (FDRs) to validate the mapped peptides. Presented here is a tool capable of meeting this goal, the UCSD proteogenomic pipeline, which maps peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) to the genome using the Inspect MS/MS database search tool and assigns a statistical significance to the match using a target-decoy search approach to assign estimated FDRs. This pipeline also provides the option of using a more reliable approach to proteogenomics by determining the precise false-positive rates (FPRs) and p-values of each PSM by calculating their spectral probabilities and rescoring each PSM accordingly. In addition to the protein prediction challenges in the rapidly growing number of sequenced plant genomes, it is difficult to extract high-quality protein samples from many plant species. For that reason, this chapter contains methods for protein extraction and trypsin digestion that reliably produce samples suitable for proteogenomic analysis.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Brett Chapman"", ids = ""46405576""); list(name = ""Natalie Castellana"", ids = ""3123550""); list(name = ""Alex Apffel"", ids = ""50130332""); list(name = ""Ryan Ghan"", ids = ""5290313""); list(name = ""Grant R.

8ea8692e71716f720f7285744dc96675dc1a5ccb,Transcriptional Profiling Identifies Genes Differentially Regulated by the BCR/ABL Fusion Oncogene.,"The translocation t(9;22) is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and also occurs in 30% of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this study, we analyzed differential gene expression using microarrays to determine if upregulation or downregulation of specific genes may explain the distinct phenotypes. Enriched monoculear cells from 218 adult patients were hybridized to Affymetrix U133 set (A+B) microarrays (discovery set). Resulting lists of differentially expressed genes were further analyzed in an independent set of 110 patients hybridized to U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays (validation set). In a first analysis ALL with t(9;22) (n=34 discovery, n=6 validation) and CML (n=75 discovery, n=49 validation) were included. Various unsupervised data analysis algorithms, e.g. hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis, clearly separated both types of t(9;22) leukemias from each other. A supervised approach, i.e. t-test statistics followed by false discovery rate estimation, identified genes that were significantly differentially expressed. Using the top differentially expressed genes in a classification algorithm (SVM) >97% of the samples were correctly assigned to their classes, both in the discovery and the validation cohort. This set of genes was further examined by pathway analysis (Ingenuity software). Numerous networks point at clear biological differences between both t(9;22) types. Higher expressed genes in CML were connected to networks related to leukotriene metabolism, immune response, integrin signaling, non-selective vesicle transport, or humoral defense mechanisms. This reflects the underlying transcriptional profile of granulation of promyelocytes in CML in contrast to the non-granulated immature ALL blasts. The aggressiveness of acute leukemic blasts is visualized by several pathways where genes with higher expression in t(9;22) positive ALL were aggregated to networks with cellular functions of DNA metabolism and replication, cell cycle progression, and protein biosynthesis. Next analyses were performed to mine for common t(9;22) target genes. CML samples were compared against an equal number of AML with normal karyotype, and t(9;22) ALL against an equal number of c-ALL/Pre-B-ALL without t(9;22). Then both lists of differentially expressed genes were compared for overlapping probe sets. Here, no statistically significant differentially expressed genes were identified as consistently associated with the presence of t(9;22) across the two lineages. In contrast, using a similar strategy where ALL and AML with t(11q23)/MLL were grouped together and were analyzed against various non-MLL positive leukemia subtypes it is possible to identify common t(11q23)/MLL target genes, e.g. a overexpressed HOXA cluster gene signature. This leads to the hypothesis that both types of t(9;22) leukemias, despite an identical underlying chromosomal aberration, trigger different genes involved in BCR/ABL-dependent leukemogenesis. Thus, depending on the cellular background, i.e. myeloid or lymphoid, translocation t(9;22) results in two types of leukemias with fundamental differences in gene expression, clinical course, and the time and quality of response to therapy which is demonstrated also if a BCR/ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (e.g. imatinib mesylate) is administered.",2004,Biology,"list(name = ""Alexander Kohlmann"", ids = ""2473934""); list(name = ""Claudia Schoch"", ids = ""145934200""); list(name = ""Susanne Schnittger"", ids = ""88454530""); list(name = ""Sylvia Merk"", ids = ""21717287""); list(name = ""Martin Dugas"", ids = ""152198280""); list(name = ""Wolfgang Hiddemann"", ids = ""84144753""); list(name = ""Wolfgang Kern"", ids = ""145091281""); list(name = ""Torsten Haferlach"", ids = ""2905029"")",,,Blood,104,1537-1537
1ab87a75a6a4233eba7f778760989e2b3092047e,Metabolome-Wide Association Study of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma.,"PURPOSE
To determine if primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients can be differentiated from controls based on metabolic characteristics.


METHODS
We used ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry with C18 liquid chromatography for metabolomic analysis on frozen plasma samples from 72 POAG patients and 72 controls. Metabolome-wide Spearman correlation was performed to select differentially expressed metabolites (DEM) correlated with POAG. We corrected P values for multiple testing using Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR). Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was used to depict the relationship between participants and DEM. Differentially expressed metabolites were matched to the METLIN metabolomics database; both DEM and metabolites significantly correlating with DEM were analyzed using MetaboAnalyst to identify metabolic pathways altered in POAG.


RESULTS
Of the 2440 m/z (mass/charge) features recovered after filtering, 41 differed between POAG cases and controls at FDR = 0.05. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed these DEM to associate into eight clusters; three of these clusters contained the majority of the DEM and included palmitoylcarnitine, hydroxyergocalciferol, and high-resolution METLIN matches to sphingolipids, other vitamin D-related metabolites, and terpenes. MetaboAnalyst also indicated likely alteration in steroid biosynthesis pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
Global ultrahigh resolution metabolomics emphasized the importance of altered lipid metabolism in POAG. The results suggest specific metabolic processes, such as those involving palmitoylcarnitine, sphingolipids, vitamin D-related compounds, and steroid precursors, may contribute to POAG status and merit more detailed study with targeted methods.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Lucia Goodwin Burgess"", ids = ""39663737""); list(name = ""Karan Uppal"", ids = ""2944354""); list(name = ""Douglas I.

In particular mBIC, mBIC1 and mBIC2 are discussed, three modifications of the Bayesian information criterion BIC which in case of an orthogonal designs control the family wise error (mBIC) and the false discovery rate (mBIC1, mBIC2), respectively.

6e89e54aa72357ee7409301ad2469b6daf4b8e48,ADULT BRAIN GrayMatter Volume Reduction Is Associated with Cognitive Impairment in Neuromyelitis Optica,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Whether gray matter impairment occurs in neuromyelitis optica is a matter of ongoing debate, and the association of gray matter impairment with cognitive deficits remains largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate gray matter volume reductions and their association with cognitive decline in patients with neuromyelitis optica. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 50 patients with neuromyelitis optica and 50 sex-, age-, handedness-, and educationmatched healthy subjects who underwent high-resolution structural MR imaging examinations and a battery of cognitive assessments. Gray matter volume and cognitive differences were compared between the 2 groups. The correlations of the regional gray matter volume with cognitive scores and clinical variables were explored in the patients with neuromyelitis optica. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls (635.9 51.18 mL), patients with neuromyelitis optica (602.8 51.03 mL) had a 5.21% decrease in the mean gray matter volume of the whole brain (P .001). The significant gray matter volume reduction in neuromyelitis optica affected the frontal and temporal cortices and the right thalamus (false discovery rate correction, P .05). The regional gray matter volumes in the frontal and temporal cortices were negatively correlated with disease severity in patients with neuromyelitis optica (Alphasim correction, P .05). Patients with neuromyelitis optica had impairments in memory, information processing speed, and verbal fluency (P .05), which were correlated with gray matter volume reductions in the medial prefrontal cortex and thalamus (Alphasim correction, P .05). CONCLUSIONS: Gray matter volume reduction is present in patients with neuromyelitis optica and is associated with cognitive impairment and disease severity in this group.

13d32d8a170d2557ef1e0e3e6922b04c46175e13,Graph Theoretical Approaches in Brain Networks,"In the last decade network theory has proved an effective tool for modeling and describing the complex topology emerging either from anatomical or functional brain connectivity patterns. From a graph theoretical perspective, the brain can be conceived as a networked system composed of nodes coincident with different brain sites and links which in the current view can either represent anatomical tracts between brain regions or measures of statistical dependencies between their electrical activity. One of the most intriguing, and now well known, examples of the application of network theory to neuroimaging data unveiled that the way brain regions are connected is typically neither regular nor random. Instead brain networks, like other real networked systems, tend to exhibit a complex structure theoretically consistent with the capability of processing information within regional clusters and avoiding excessive connections between clusters. While the simplest instantiation of this configuration showed similar characteristics to mathematically defined â€œsmall-worldâ€ networks, it has become clear that additional topological structures including hierarchical modularity can nuance our expectations of the brain's underlying architecture and dynamics. An important goal in these research endeavors is to identify how brain network organization can inform our understanding of the brain's intuitive need to balance the two competing principles of integration and segregation and how alterations in brain structure and dynamics can lead to alterations in human behavior and cognitive function. The present special issue collects a series of selected contributions related to the methodological and practical applications of network theory to anatomical and functional brain connectivity patterns. 
 
The contribution entitled â€œVoxel scale complex networks of functional connectivity in the rat brain: neurochemical state dependence of global and local topological propertiesâ€ addresses the dependence of the functional connectivity estimated from the fMRI signals of the rat brain in response to alterations of the neurotransmitter system as induced by the administration of specific pharmaceutical drugs such as d-amphetamine, fluoxetine, and nicotine. 
 
The contribution entitled â€œA signal-processing-based approach to time-varying graph analysis for dynamic brain network identificationâ€ proposes a dynamic network summarization approach to describe the time-varying evolution of connectivity patterns in functional brain activity. The proposed method is evaluated on event-related potential (ERP) data, which demonstrates the dynamic nature of functional connectivity. 
 
The contribution entitled â€œhow the statistical validation of functional connectivity patterns can prevent erroneous definition of small-world properties of a brain connectivity networkâ€ addresses important methodological choices that are often made in the construction of functional brain network from EEG data, including the choice of statistical thresholds to determine the presence or absence of network links and the role of spatial correlations in determining graph properties. 
 
The contribution entitled â€œweighted phase lag index and graph analysis: preliminary investigation of functional connectivity during resting state in childrenâ€ presents original results concerning the application of small-world parameters and betweenness centrality measures to characterize the topological structure of the functional network in the children's brain from noninvasive MEG recordings. 
 
The contribution entitled â€œsource space analysis of event-related dynamic reorganization of brain networksâ€ conducts a quantitative study of the dynamic reconfiguration of connectivity for event-related experiments at source space level, which provides a global and complete view of the stages of processing associated with the regional changes in activity. 
 
The contribution entitled â€œRedundancy as a Graph-Based Index of Frequency Specific MEG Functional Connectivityâ€ focuses on quantifying the differential role that paths of different lengths potentially play in brain connectivity and demonstrates that a redundancy-based measure captures unique information not accessible via approaches that only examine the shortest paths through a network. 
 
The contribution entitled â€œA computationally efficient, exploratory approach to brain connectivity incorporating false discovery rate control, a priori knowledge, and group inferenceâ€ proposes a multisubject, exploratory brain connectivity modeling approach. The proposed method allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge of connectivity and the determination of the dominant brain connectivity pattern among a group of subjects.

d9414bbd47572a97bc6432b313730b0383527c2d,Periodontal inflamed surface area in patients on haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis: a Croatian cross-sectional study,"BACKGROUND
The decision to initiate dialysis treatment via haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) often involves the consideration of complex factors and remains a matter of debate. The purpose of this study was to quantify the inflammatory burden that periodontitis causes in dialysis patients and to examine whether patients on PD and HD differ in terms of the periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA), which can be helpful for selecting the most appropriate dialysis modality.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study was performed on 58 consecutive patients on HD and 31 consecutive patients on PD. PISA was calculated using measurements of the clinical attachment level, recession and bleeding on probing. We performed the primary analysis using multivariable robust regression.


RESULTS
Patients on PD had a 746â€‰mm2 (93%) lower mean PISA than patients on HD after adjustment for 20 possible confounders, including the duration of dialysis. The type of dialysis was independently correlated with the PISA (semipartial correlation: -â€‰0.50; pÂ =â€‰0.017; false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰5%). After adjusting for confounding factors, the correlation between the duration and type of dialysis was not significant (F (2,44)â€‰=â€‰0.01; pÂ =â€‰0.994; Î·2Â =â€‰0.00). Differences in the PISA between patients who had undergone dialysis for less than a year, 2-3â€‰years orâ€‰â‰¥â€‰3â€‰years were not significantly different in either of the two dialysis groups.


CONCLUSIONS
PISA levels in Croatian patients on dialysis indicate a high need for periodontal treatment. PD is associated with a smaller PISA independent of many sociodemographic, lifestyle, laboratory and clinical factors. The duration of dialysis does not influence PISA levels.

Nat. Genet. http://dx.doi. org/10.1038/ng.3539 (2016) There is increasing realization that genetic variation in non-coding regulatory elements, such as enhancers, has a major role in evolution, complex traits and diseases. However, a key challenge is to identify the genes regulated by these elements in order to dissect the gene regulatory networks through which they act. A new study reports a machine-learning approach that leverages multilayered epigenomics profiles to predict which promoters are targeted by particular enhancers. Various approaches have been devised to predict the target genes of regulatory elements. These strategies have largely relied on simple but intuitive criteria, such as prioritizing genes based on genomic proximity to the regulatory element and/or based on quantitative trait locus analyses (that is, genes for which expression levels correlate with genetic variation in the element). Whalen et al. sought to determine whether target gene predictions could be improved by taking advantage of the rich information within existing epigenomic profiling data sets; such profiles include DNA methylation status, numerous histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, binding locations of diverse transcription factors and chromosome architecture proteins, and gene expression data. The team focused on six human cell lines of different tissue types for which extensive and diverse molecular data sets are available. They identified putative active enhancers and promoters based on characteristic histone modifications and open chromatin, and then classified enhancerâ€“ promoter pairs that were less than 2 Mb apart into target versus nontarget pairs using evidence of enhancerâ€“promoter physical contact from chromatin conformation capture data. They then built their â€˜TargetFinderâ€™ machine-learning algorithm to dissect which of the molecular profiling features could predict the enhancerâ€“promoter interactions. Overall, the researchers found that no single feature provided strong predictive power, but that the algorithm could identify an optimal combination of features that was highly informative and achieved a false discovery rate (FDR) of only 8â€“15%. By comparison, a standard alternative method based on the nearest actively transcribed gene had an FDR of 53â€“77%. Within the optimal combination of features, those that contributed most to the predictive power across cell lines included DNA methylation, histone marks associated with transcription elongation, and binding sites of repressive or architectural proteins.

9527b4eb0ed8a138606c617232f1443d66ce24c2,Identification and functional analysis of early gene expression induced by circadian light-resetting in Drosophila,"BackgroundThe environmental lightâ€“dark cycle is the dominant cue that maintains 24-h biological rhythms in multicellular organisms. In Drosophila, light entrainment is mediated by the photosensitive protein CRYPTOCHROME, but the role and extent of transcription regulation in light resetting of the dipteran clock is yet unknown. Given the broad transcriptional changes in response to light previously identified in mammals, we have sought to analyse light-induced global transcriptional changes in the flyâ€™s head by using Affymetrix microarrays. Flies were subjected to a 30-min light pulse during the early night (3Â h after lights-off), a stimulus which causes a substantial phase delay of the circadian rhythm. We then analysed changes in gene expression 1Â h after the light stimulus.ResultsWe identified 200 genes whose transcripts were significantly altered in response to the light pulse at a false discovery rate cut-off of 10Â %. Analysis of these genes and their biological functions suggests the involvement of at least six biological processes in light-induced delay phase shifts of rhythmic activities. These processes include signalling, ion channel transport, receptor activity, synaptic organisation, signal transduction, and chromatin remodelling. Using RNAi, the expression of 22 genes was downregulated in the clock neurons, leading to significant effects on circadian output. For example, while continuous light normally causes arrhythmicity in wild-type flies, the knockdown of Kr-h1, Nipped-A, Thor, nrv1, Nf1, CG11155 (ionotropic glutamate receptor), and Fmr1 resulted in flies that were rhythmic, suggesting a disruption in the light input pathway to the clock.ConclusionsOur analysis provides a first insight into the early responsive genes that are activated by light and their contribution to light resetting of the Drosophila clock. The analysis suggests multiple domains and pathways that might be associated with light entrainment, including a mechanism that was represented by a light-activated set of chromatin remodelling genes.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Adeolu B Adewoye"", ids = ""5176404""); list(name = ""Charalambos P Kyriacou"", ids = ""1787733""); list(name = ""Eran Tauber"", ids = ""38723781"")",73be38fcd850eb9e3b79825b8f3aa34bd7f4c535; 6ac38dde3394b006fd9c522d08795f1a0dc27e9f; 117f3613a5028bd7ca941627b005197ee82c5b16; 0c4a79d48e08eed6edb8dfdfbee9442e99869af5; e751d223b3682f1adfd7e60c0c19f8c74a5c8bb9; 4208b2ea0f358b0a41c997cebf30ec97b0526a41; 1cfac28389d72dd6ffea2b0b54318c2ccb18c92f; 1f24eba92d281676c6eb4021df422b3ebdc49416; d27f7ed1684549138d832855837b2440ebdc89e2; 3ca34457fc68840576c637b2c0ee1540fc75e53c; e136b5df9c8000f927a6188e5854cba6636f1002; 995d79d91278f8135e347d8055f0dd75ddd3d0ae; f096b6ede3873c63b1636d7154d63b4a4ce734a9,1237a4428a34082dcf7cfb32ea0eef4e4c38e0dc; 012f32e3aaa4f01a93eb5a5d2805c1fe7b90deda; 022dc826955bfdf43a4bfce66cdeeecda95e197e; 420f60f180d7fc927de6bf9b2279fb946c5d7ba6; a324b47d340ec6c30ab0ba5d2fc6d50b887d5245; 390556c876d02d60393c499a1296407fdf359a7d; f5a410ab4ede095cafeafe8415eb2b43c98a7966; 2bedf34dc14fb8f50ea98eb6f328e2f8c178e1b9; 007cfc56c858431a481e6f333b80942a4d88c0d4; fe4638edc56d07eb518b21dc2dee8fc4853e6842; 89351101b833889f7ec4081aea878e95dcf17441; 0498ecdf8a2723f7d36459149616336be378b0cd; ab27503b19877ae214041ea61c8cd0d50711e1bf; 2d1e4a2ff70f58f15817339661348285a1acf142; 50c8aa9553877f2891cb99acee0c3e258dea3ef8; 1136909280f978a3520d6d2cae6014121e794138; 1637e730519540eeeaddab0694c7c47f6b73223d; e38e3aab28f1434a323f318f3a16a829520ff273; bd6a3fb3b7849380a4324dd0050c1b9dd4468dfb; 0c764280a4365fe4fb4a01e77c0fdad0b88ec207; 97b9aa5237735669449e411f0cd5e297a5d3b7d9; 74dcb7c98e0f4b539bb0f691c63474a8626e9aa6; 72226ec151d454077aa698001f74ddacac650535; 544081dd7e9a6261f028332ed81da7106ebf1ef6; 0dc791e7f7820002724608ebca865a686fbaeef3; 357e31ca0aaa2747a997635a67a7773e08b05828; d4becfd1b0c931e2a67f1074cd84453f1dc18006; e73993b763075106da50d6eae54fd86628aa839c; 409e9d1762e19199fa6ec722f58863baba917a91; 5ecf07e3506b268691edbbf24fbab518635a8a7e; 8596f87a481bbbe618fe66db1e1ee50b467b044e; f305be3031a413f79d525135d3f046e2c3a4db55; b471232c8ca21cda8460e9d3a40b5505a7de9af1; 860b0e16ef0178f75bae6550f00951fef653311e; bf453ea05b5613564c2985a60488ac96598f430c; 1c3559b9fb509347c5eaa6f0b12c00ee82f31ee4; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 3e6b3e2f7b455c3541d98207e267322c3a547fb9; 12b620a66e5a14026de856194781e33937abf447; c8ea67512bb78258c35a073fc4e92551be2ac5b4; 798fd796d447492b8a22f979f0767d6a23a4e7a0; 1823026160626ed2cd47de840d3829a7bb2ebb38; 65a56dc1c70066a94c8ef6de02c6a3a60dae913f; 54e38b9c28e655de284898333d730d12114a8228; 2ca126ae97b04262698775b1a7fc0de1fae8b8db; 7739e6d83cd66018afc97253f2472ec74fc75bdd; e0daf5cfb6cb35b1602a6a34b798ac179b40cb33; 220d07e8978719040c57bf20d05eb84ca169014d; eace7aac77660f7304cb75bf35a50852ceda4284; e217fb8fa511c54090524770a0057d49d5d8562e; c4dda0114a613d528fc640732afe5bf603ff65fc; 56206d1a4998da014cb4412b14ef9c0774933755; 23dd238de1bbe6194d7e4a52dcc6c2611e909ad1; aa8cda6a3f1458dc8cc2e04667cc524789ef1fda; b2137676fbf9208a84d25ab1bdb2335f5f73a1b2; f426fd7cf9ec0046ebf3a202048be0cd22c2c6a1; ba07007a6a956507d1e87abf594750255b3ab7e2,BMC Genomics,16,
bbf0f1ced1137dc3801b04a513553460d4d79a63,Bone Marrow Adipocyte-Derived Free Fatty Acids Induce Gene Signature Linking Transcription with Metabolic Changes That Contribute to Survival of Acute Monocytic Leukemia Cells,"Adipocytes are the prevalent stromal cell type in adult bone marrows (BM). With increasing age, BM stroma-resident mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), increase their capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, which leads to the progressive accumulation of fat in the BM space. It is conceivable that the increased BM adipocyte content promotes leukemogenesis and negatively affects responsiveness to chemotherapy. We previously reported that free fatty acids (FFAs) promote the metabolic shift from pyruvate oxidation to fatty acid oxidation (FAO), which causes uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and promotes leukemia cell survival (Samudio, J Clin Invest. 2010) . We further demonstrated the prominent antiapoptotic effects of BM-derived adipocytes co-cultured with cells from acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL), a poor-prognosis subtype of AML (Tabe ASH. 2013) . Proteomic analysis with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) showed upregulation of protein folding pathways which increases the expression of antiapoptotic chaperone proteins HSP70 and HSP90, of integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration pathways and downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation along with repression of cytochrome c . Metacore gene ontology (GO) analysis identified NF-kB, c-Jun, SP1, AP-1, and HMG as the potent relevant transcription factors that closely interact with and activate chaperone proteins, chromatin, and gene transcription. In this study, we characterized a gene signature linking transcription with metabolic changes that contribute to AMoL cell survival under conditions mimicking aging BM with prevalent adipocytes. We confirmed the antiapoptotic role of FFAs produced by the primary BM MSC-derived adipocytes via pharmacologic inhibition of FAO by etomoxir (EX), which inhibits fatty acid entry into the mitochondria. EX (50mM) treatment reversed the prosurvival effects of adipocytes on serum-starved U937 monoblast cells (% Annexin V, -/+ EX: mono-culture, 30.1Â±9.0 / 31.5Â±4.6; co-culture with adipocytes, 8.9Â±2.1 / 29.6Â±9.2; P=0.02). To assess the molecular links between metabolic pathways and gene expression triggered by BM adipocytes, we performed RNA-seq transcriptome analysis with a next generation sequencer system HiSeq1500 (Illumina) using TopHat software for alignment and Cufflinks software for identifying differential gene expression. RNA-Seq detected upregulation of 21 genes in U937 cells after co-culture with BM-derived adipocytes (false discovery rate, KLF9 , co-chaperone immunophilin protein FKBP5, chemokine CXCL12 receptor CXCR4, receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3, PI3K negative regulator PIK3IP1 , and immunosuppressive transcriptional regulator TSC22D3 . GO pathway analysis further revealed that co-culture with adipocytes induced upregulation of antioxidant thioredoxin peroxidase activity, which was reversed by EX. Together with the iTRAQ GO results, the antioxidative chaperone proteins might play critical roles in regulation of FAO with repression of oxidative phosphorylation in AMoL cells in adipocytes abundant BM. DNA array (GeneSQUARE) analysis and quantitative RT-PCR detected upregulation of fatty acid binding protein 4 ( FABP4 ), scavenger receptor CD36 , nuclear receptor PPARG , and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 in U937 cells co-cultured with adipocytes. It is known that FFAs, the ligand of nuclear receptor PPARÎ³, activate PPARÎ³ and promote FFA uptake through transcriptional induction of CD36 and FABP4 in monocytic cells. EX treatment, which blocks the entry of fatty acids into the mitochondria, induced prominent elevation of FABP4 in U937 cells co-cultured with adipocytes . These results indicate that the FABP4-mediated internalization and ligation of fatty acids to PPARÎ³ facilitates transcriptional activation. From the transcriptome analysis and the mitochondrial uncoupling metabolic changes, we conclude that the survival of AMoL cells depends on the cooperative interactions between lipid metabolism and transcriptional activation of factors associated with chaperones, chemokines, and integrins. Strategies targeting FAO warrant further exploration in patients with monocytic leukemia, which is highly dependent on altered lipid metabolism.

Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MTHFR gene, 677C>T and 1298A>C, result in a thermolabile enzyme with reduced function. These variants, in both the maternal and/or fetal genes, have been associated with pregnancy complications including miscarriage, neural tube defects (NTDs), and preeclampsia (PE), perhaps due to altered capacity for DNA methylation (DNAm). In this study, we assessed the association between MTHFR 677TT and 1298CC genotypes and risk of NTDs, PE, or normotensive intrauterine growth restriction (nIUGR). Additionally, we assessed whether these high-risk genotypes are associated with altered DNAm in the placenta.ResultsIn 303 placentas screened for this study, we observed no significant association between the occurrence of NTDs (Nâ€‰=â€‰55), PE (early-onset: Nâ€‰=â€‰28, late-onset: Nâ€‰=â€‰20), or nIUGR (Nâ€‰=â€‰21) and placental (fetal) MTHFR 677TT or 1298CC genotypes compared to healthy pregnancies (Nâ€‰=â€‰179), though a trend of increased 677TT genotype in PE/IUGR together was observed (OR 2.53, pâ€‰=â€‰0.048). DNAm was profiled in 10 high-risk 677 (677TT + 1298AA), 10 high-risk 1298 (677CC + 1298CC), and 10 reference (677CC + 1298AA) genotype placentas. Linear modeling identified no significantly differentially methylated sites between high-risk 677 or 1298 and reference placentas at a false discovery rate <â€‰0.05 and Î”Î² â‰¥â€‰0.05 using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Using a differentially methylated region analysis or separating cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) by CpG density to reduce multiple comparisons also did not identify differential methylation. Additionally, there was no consistent evidence for altered methylation of repetitive DNA between high-risk and reference placentas.ConclusionsWe conclude that large-scale, genome-wide disruption in DNAm does not occur in placentas with the high-risk MTHFR 677TT or 1298CC genotypes. Furthermore, there was no evidence for an association of the 1298CC genotype and only a tendency to higher 677TT in pregnancy complications of PE/IUGR. This may be due to small sample sizes or folate repletion in our Canadian population attenuating effects of the high-risk MTHFR variants.

It is often of interest to test for differential expression (DE) between conditions, e.g. treatment vs control or between cell types. Simulation studies have shown that non-parametric tests, such as the Wilcoxon-rank sum test, can robustly detect significant DE, with better performance than many parametric tools specifically developed for scRNA-seq data analysis. However, these rank tests cannot be used for complex experimental designs involving multiple groups, multiple factors and confounding variables. Further, rank based tests do not provide an interpretable measure of the effect size. We propose a semi-parametric approach based on probabilistic index models (PIM) that form a flexible class of models that generalize classical rank tests. Our method does not rely on strong distributional assumptions and it allows accounting for confounding factors. Moreover, it allows for the estimation of the effect size in terms of a probabilistic index. Real data analysis demonstrate that PIM is capable of identifying biologically meaningful DE. Our simulation studies also show that DE tests succeed well in controlling the false discovery rate at its nominal level, while maintaining good sensitivity as compared to competing methods.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Alemu Takele Assefa"", ids = ""51130825""); list(name = ""Jo Vandesompele"", ids = ""144820005""); list(name = ""Olivier Thas"", ids = ""1684426"")",,779f1919ab4bac545818971e0e1aad0763db0304; 200f728eee7b2cff84fcd8d2d9b47da3a5a2ab82; b5aa8e99fceaa7a597d648f71fa347813a824ed9; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 61bc0578a8d2e94f745aa9c26501872e3ab51281; 5de665f5bbf2988bb66787dca9da5fb502d7c112; 2f6fe4db47e008bb1c6528c0265ad81e68f9555f; 3d6eb6e82ac7056b2bae80e88e03ef92c61d102e; fdc2b0b00d520ab8d7c3fd20e0e2b763fa285503; 0b1982fa1c5f92e707fb81da4954b80b2af987c2; 51e8ac354bd9ef7d3cecefc00850cc3092173911; 571c3ea8cabd16ab0ae7a1a3495d3f3aca918e23; 62f8a69c7e3809949dd023852e0e0a54c49eaf74; e5d73bb7f1622b48fef525f1472981908d3a8b9a; efe973075ac6c86965fdc937e44d5bbac34d00c9; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 73c42031d99e6f2d48d33969b281f84cffce5b47; ba0452a487f67e7c233967f4c5b56d1c786631b0; 0d7e58fc24bd5790bfd536506e0879cb0a9565c4; db492b0119eda91497a4b725ae94fcf95a1e57ab; df24ea7d3a5e17896cb2905088996ec9a850bc33; fccbcbe07de338889b71f9e59c99960a53d86ccb; c4c438b8de44d0cc1300328cb6465197faaebe25; 9d45f5d699ed2e7c1271044444e04d2d81987468; 98b9fde16d450f858bae75dfc466f2009083a9f0; e4ae512d02b519ae13ff18fb37ecde3e3831f683; c044171ee90ec6c7546db2c10dc7312674aa5b6a; 755b48a3a9743b394c0d2f6034ce004873835eb0; 3821611ffcb58f548b02840689ecbfcbfa841b40; aa85e1113a304c9e982778aec9b5b96a39d30431; 74e86a3375ac2c2ffe89577fbf16456eb39ff581; ed3c7c934b24f2c4b0dfd8fa3e59a33be0580589; df130a5aca2fe67cdf63c29962ab929705b32ce3; 772f5fca88de0f6f38116d73cc32e23efe780a10; c7140379ab3c2fead124710173f7ddb4744acab2,bioRxiv,,
da59fdacb32d09a7c7283dac4640e0d27c8e8841,Resting state functional connectivity in women with bipolar disorder during clinical remission,"OBJECTIVES
Periods of euthymia in bipolar disorder (BD) serve as a valuable time to study trait-based pathophysiology. The use of resting state functional connectivity (Rs-FC) can aid in the understanding of BD pathophysiology free of task or mood state biases. The present study investigated two unexplored areas of Rs-FC research in bipolar remission: (i) Rs-FC in women, controlling for the potential influence of premenstrual symptoms, and (ii) the use of both independent component analysis (ICA) and seed-based analysis (SBA) to investigate Rs-FC.


METHODS
We investigated Rs-FC of the default mode network, meso-paralimbic network and fronto-parietal network in a sample of 32 euthymic women with BD and 36 age-matched controls during the mid-follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. Rs-FC was assessed with ICA and SBA using the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as seed points for their respective resting state networks.


RESULTS
In BD, compared to controls, SBAs revealed increased coupling between the PCC and the angular gyrus (P=.002, false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected) and between the right dlPFC and the brainstem (P=.03, FDR-corrected). In BD only, PCC-angular gyrus coupling was correlated with anxiety symptoms. Group differences in Rs-FC using ICA did not survive multiple comparisons.


CONCLUSIONS
Negative findings from whole-brain ICA Rs-FC may reflect a state of clinical remission in BD.

6e1c3b23ea187ba6b9b3328cddc99c2c2978bad7,Ratio-Based Analysis of Differential mRNA Processing and Expression of a Polyadenylation Factor Mutant pcfs4 Using Arabidopsis Tiling Microarray,"BACKGROUND
Alternative polyadenylation as a mechanism in gene expression regulation has been widely recognized in recent years. Arabidopsis polyadenylation factor PCFS4 was shown to function in leaf development and in flowering time control. The function of PCFS4 in controlling flowering time was correlated with the alternative polyadenylation of FCA, a flowering time regulator. However, genetic evidence suggested additional targets of PCFS4 that may mediate its function in both flowering time and leaf development.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
To identify further targets, we investigated the whole transcriptome of a PCFS4 mutant using Affymetrix Arabidopsis genomic tiling 1.0R array and developed a data analysis pipeline, termed RADPRE (Ratio-based Analysis of Differential mRNA Processing and Expression). In RADPRE, ratios of normalized probe intensities between wild type Columbia and a pcfs4 mutant were first generated. By doing so, one of the major problems of tiling array data--variations caused by differential probe affinity--was significantly alleviated. With the probe ratios as inputs, a hierarchy of statistical tests was carried out to identify differentially processed genes (DPG) and differentially expressed genes (DEG). The false discovery rate (FDR) of this analysis was estimated by using the balanced random combinations of Col/pcfs4 and pcfs4/Col ratios as inputs. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the DPGs and DEGs revealed potential new roles of PCFS4 in stress responses besides flowering time regulation.


CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE
We identified 68 DPGs and 114 DEGs with FDR at 1% and 2%, respectively. Most of the 68 DPGs were subjected to alternative polyadenylation, splicing or transcription initiation. Quantitative PCR analysis of a set of DPGs confirmed that most of these genes were truly differentially processed in pcfs4 mutant plants. The enriched GO term ""regulation of flower development"" among PCFS4 targets further indicated the efficacy of the RADPRE pipeline.

e986173a0bb8467ced085608a9366bd1de85074d,A Multivariate Genome-Wide Association Study of Wing Shape in Drosophila melanogaster.,"Due to the complexity of genotype-phenotype relationships, simultaneous analyses of genomic associations with multiple traits will be more powerful and informative than a series of univariate analyses. However, in most cases, studies of genotype-phenotype relationships have been analyzed only one trait at a time. Here, we report the results of a fully integrated multivariate genome-wide association analysis of the shape of the Drosophila melanogaster wing in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel. Genotypic effects on wing shape were highly correlated between two different laboratories. We found 2396 significant SNPs using a 5% false discovery rate cutoff in the multivariate analyses, but just four significant SNPs in univariate analyses of scores on the first 20 principal component axes. One quarter of these initially significant SNPs retain their effects in regularized models that take into account population structure and linkage disequilibrium. A key advantage of multivariate analysis is that the direction of the estimated phenotypic effect is much more informative than a univariate one. We exploit this fact to show that the effects of knockdowns of genes implicated in the initial screen were on average more similar than expected under a null model. A subset of SNP effects were replicable in an unrelated panel of inbred lines. Association studies that take a phenomic approach, considering many traits simultaneously, are an important complement to the power of genomics.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""William Pitchers"", ids = ""3767800""); list(name = ""Jessica Nye"", ids = ""144425713""); list(name = ""Eladio J.

ea9e521bd39b305e0df17dae60e1bda09719f6cc,Genome-wide mapping of imprinted differentially methylated regions by DNA methylation profiling of human placentas from triploidies,"BackgroundGenomic imprinting is an important epigenetic process involved in regulating placental and foetal growth. Imprinted genes are typically associated with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) whereby one of the two alleles is DNA methylated depending on the parent of origin. Identifying imprinted DMRs in humans is complicated by species- and tissue-specific differences in imprinting status and the presence of multiple regulatory regions associated with a particular gene, only some of which may be imprinted. In this study, we have taken advantage of the unbalanced parental genomic constitutions in triploidies to further characterize human DMRs associated with known imprinted genes and identify novel imprinted DMRs.ResultsBy comparing the promoter methylation status of over 14,000 genes in human placentas from ten diandries (extra paternal haploid set) and ten digynies (extra maternal haploid set) and using 6 complete hydatidiform moles (paternal origin) and ten chromosomally normal placentas for comparison, we identified 62 genes with apparently imprinted DMRs (false discovery rate <0.1%). Of these 62 genes, 11 have been reported previously as DMRs that act as imprinting control regions, and the observed parental methylation patterns were concordant with those previously reported. We demonstrated that novel imprinted genes, such as FAM50B, as well as novel imprinted DMRs associated with known imprinted genes (for example, CDKN1C and RASGRF1) can be identified by using this approach. Furthermore, we have demonstrated how comparison of DNA methylation for known imprinted genes (for example, GNAS and CDKN1C) between placentas of different gestations and other somatic tissues (brain, kidney, muscle and blood) provides a detailed analysis of specific CpG sites associated with tissue-specific imprinting and gestational age-specific methylation.ConclusionsDNA methylation profiling of triploidies in different tissues and developmental ages can be a powerful and effective way to map and characterize imprinted regions in the genome.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ryan Kc Yuen"", ids = ""144711138""); list(name = ""Ruby Jiang"", ids = ""3855043""); list(name = ""MarÃ­a Serena PeÃ±aherrera"", ids = ""5213376""); list(name = ""D.

7a46a59662cd7cd746122f8c19b8b34b4fcdfac3,The rectal microbiota of cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus infection and uninfected controls.,"Rectal swabs were collected from 31 cats, 16 with FIV infection and 15 uninfected controls, to evaluate and compare the rectal bacterial microbiota in cats with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection and uninfected controls. The rectal microbiota was characterized via next generation sequencing of 16S rRNA gene (V4 region) polymerase chain reaction products. Eighteen different phyla were identified. Firmicutes dominated in both groups, followed by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, but there were no significant differences between groups. When predominant orders are compared, FIV-infected cats had significant higher median relative abundances of Bifidobacteriales (P=0.022), Lactobacillales (P=0.022) and Aeromonadales (P=0.043). No differences were identified in the 50 most common genera when adjusted for false discovery rate. There were significant differences in community membership (Jaccard index, unifrac P=0.008, AMOVA P<0.001) and community structure (Yue&Clayton index, unifrac P=0.03, AMOVA P=0.005) between groups. However, only one metacommunity (enterotype) was identified. The rectal microbiota differed between cats with FIV infection and uninfected controls. Some of the changes that were noted have been associated with 'dysbiosis' and proinflammatory states in other species, so it is possible that subclinical alteration in the intestinal microbiota could influence the health of FIV-infected cats.

f6a33e4121a8dbf641a485a7ae8db74aa2fd1306,Mapping genetic determinants of coronary microvascular remodeling in the spontaneously hypertensive rat,"The mechanisms underlying coronary microvascular remodeling and dysfunction, which are critical determinants of abnormal myocardial blood flow regulation in human hypertension, are poorly understood. The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) exhibits many features of human hypertensive cardiomyopathy. We demonstrate that remodeling of intramural coronary arterioles is apparent in the SHR already at 4Â weeks of age, i.e. before the onset of systemic hypertension. To uncover possible genetic determinants of coronary microvascular remodeling, we carried out detailed histological and histomorphometric analysis of the heart and coronary vasculature in 30Â weeks old SHR, age-matched Brown Norway (BN-Lx) parentals and BXH/HXB recombinant inbred (RI) strains. Using previously mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), we carried out a genome-wide association analysis between genetic determinants of cardiac gene expression and histomorphometric traits. This identified 36 robustly mapped eQTLs in the heart which were associated with medial area of intramural coronary arterioles [false discovery rate (FDR) ~5Â %]. Transcripts, which were both under cis-acting genetic regulation and significantly correlated with medial area (FDR <5Â %), but not with blood pressure indices, were prioritized and four candidate genes were identified (Rtel1, Pla2g5, Dnaja4 and Rcn2) according to their expression levels and biological functions. Our results demonstrate that genetic factors play a role in the development of coronary microvascular remodeling and suggest blood pressure independent candidate genes for further functional experiments.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Massimiliano Mancini"", ids = ""144090722""); list(name = ""Enrico Petretto"", ids = ""78469875""); list(name = ""Christina Kleinert"", ids = ""34864567""); list(name = ""Angela Scavone"", ids = ""47776317""); list(name = ""Tisham De"", ids = ""47208060""); list(name = ""Stuart Cook"", ids = ""153400155""); list(name = ""Jan Å ilhavÃ½"", ids = ""152234743""); list(name = ""VÃ¡clav ZÃ­dek"", ids = ""5022063""); list(name = ""Michal Pravenec"", ids = ""2775886""); list(name = ""Giulia dâ\200\231Amati"", ids = ""1380970668""); list(name = ""Paolo Guido Camici"", ids = ""2357959"")",cf028a439b23ed0c40b973f23607f85e5271c3d5; 2189ee876dd996e5e2fb30b7ad3ab54c73b4af5b; e6bdad57c6cb903b0fa2aff909fe3bdcf7eb3f3d; 64139a13f1088c8bb8b40e50dab3eef4f7b15c99; 0fa98840bd6331fcb41e846e338bbe50674aadc8; f2fcb618b2e17653e6a283d717ce1a8b40871bc3; f921798ad983233556c0bac6216768c6cb23461f; a492fd55cc7240f218fb1ec9d5f2d30e8adba6d6; 32c419656665090ebe018d6550b453522b1ce305; 764e976cd84bd6174f6a893afc91b6df4399fceb; fe38bba44d18103be6420bcc89e0bb02132f88ff; dfcbbbcc20186e515d78854b47ae6d497e4f73f0; e597d639a7ad87d169f103df88b590e3ee054a40; 4f37469b2bec34ae02b7460226d6c1d218d8b0dd; 3bd06a02ba090bd393037025d233c8496ab4a82d; fd92cb6dc2e938fa22efb261c0c1c8bf7fcfd0ce; a13f922f3d3b472b061e27c87757d63964c96ed4,6e7fe8a81c08d943bf4e9026621656628f4d4447; c000255ef6f469512a246775bfa08c769c0711b9; 599397ed76e3819989e33cfc01f84d04a713f14d; 1be5acea423d0fddea33be9af24a9371c76e5068; 626353d23d4575d4c45fb2249e29f7c2d90726be; 557d0ad823f0b5aa60bcc60e8ef81a158c22242d; e3740fca20bdb948d9bdbfbc35df3edd825a2b05; d8d789194be141409bf0c0716f750358b0524931; a9628740b7a285e96f16898fca7416181eecb2d3; eeb19f3e0fc62005e663ef77899824aa3ce6b5b2; ed4a1923feea5a047c9e59893cfe86e8d372fac2; 6c704d32435f42cdc6c159ac7b0b098fb51481de; 07e36533a17626e0a2afd2eb31ad4b935803f12d; f8c12d3c7b9e5b8cc1d44751cb6171bfe7841b23; dcfb207c96a1e38b9d423a64fe554a9c9494bd50; 3af032336f42e6c4932b2d690545ef16e2ce3c4e; 699ca040e4bdb85e6ac9a2ebc59a556d4ba39674; 9e9c8fd928343db4fce5e93b5cb9c1bba6bfbf91; 13d048431a7ec1ca42cd81f539e6637940dba92c; b6385da0a8f81c3bd90cb44d9c3172d21cc3fc88; f1c6fe8ae394dff672e6b7af9136bac1b61982d1; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 537062417efc2d21960f4f10386f3c381ae573aa; 93f6b67fe96b3ce0360c2d311e50f29711d89f97; b74b25a7e5e8db48a16f71d756dd1bf56b4f5d41; 975c4f0071240d6960adafd08e25fb0db572db18; 4d733988bf6647fe7a26bcf9a9424348328c79f0; 5d6c2aa7f2befa5601e6e7d93c64f320b283845a; b87a4a082e66f4d25a030a6007825ed81e379653; e3e58f8e84c5e500455738f9eb991b343911d3d8; 7709a4f19c858d0ce7eef7bfac3b1d6b76a13db5; 18b735693006db70d9a5156902e9644283ce45e3; fae50ff0af2eed66ac891def0c52742ab05047b9; e4049e802d7a9e460e5ebadae253b8cadccd8599; 0998200ebdf067f63f877a981cd8f9405f13f2b9; 616d207d52c4be673b710cf1d8ba9268f4933a1f; 826d2fe91f63898f55c7ecc1f66186178f05521d; 1eb3b5afd2e4812bf0ad7baf43b4d0fd857a89ac; b4f33f348129bc8a84a9f53eaed25887f38f47b9; 8ad9b07bdfdaef2e1ac77de54d2f90a1656add24; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 909a3a623ce5ed9030d71ecd49d5e30c3ad8492e; 1169950cdd2cc51ad74fcb48c7a5ea68269e088e; d11c67d77d60ef8c1db1d18abe93e0d1025ca93e; 2d623c83ded1753d423d827769a242e1c98616a1; c489e8993d94afb363f1287a0894750b98080d9e,Basic Research in Cardiology,108,1-14
2c249abaac592800df0f6ee6f381bf8e0754719f,Expression profiling of genes involved in muscular activity and inactivity in hind legs of rats,"In this study, gene expression profiles of rat hind limb (soleus) muscle in three different (suspension and loading) experiments was used to investigate the genes involved in muscular activity and atrophy. Duration of muscle activity and inactivity varied between experiments. In total, expression data were on 1184 genes profiled in 39 arrays from 3 different experiments. A set of nested linear models, nesting genes within treatments within experiments was defined in R package limma for analysis. Moderated t-statistics based on empirical Bayes methods was used to indicate mode of regulation and for gene ranking. Adjustment for multiple testing was by probability of false discovery rate (pFDR). At 5% pFDR, the number of differentially expressed (DE) genes ranged from 1 to 138 across experiments. Most genes were down regulated within experiments, compared to control groups (controlled state activity). A gene which encodes Glutathione-S-transferase showed differential expression pattern over all three experiments at 10% pFDR. As a comparative approach, the expression level of this gene was mapped to genomic locations using expression quantitative trait (eQTL) approach in mouse inbred lines; the results showed trans-eQTL regions on chromosomes 10 and 3. The different experiments affected genes which are mostly likely involved in ATP production and fatty acid synthesis. Hence, the implications of this result are that the supply of energy source are of great importance for longstanding work and exercise than protein and other mediator nutrient molecules. These results have significant impact on adaptive animal and human physiology.",2007,Biology,"list(name = ""Mostafa Ghaderi-Zefrehei"", ids = ""1403464753""); list(name = ""Haja N.

3d75d75ef958e4383731d2ad1e1c217db4c4ab23,Integrative DNA methylome analysis of pan-cancer biomarkers in cancer discordant monozygotic twin-pairs,"BackgroundA key focus in cancer research is the discovery of biomarkers that accurately diagnose early lesions in non-invasive tissues. Several studies have identified malignancy-associated DNA methylation changes in blood, yet no general cancer biomarker has been identified to date. Here, we explore the potential of blood DNA methylation as a biomarker of pan-cancer (cancer of multiple different origins) in 41 female cancer discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin-pairs sampled before or after diagnosis using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.ResultsWe analysed epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles in 41 cancer discordant MZ twin-pairs with affected individuals diagnosed with tumours at different single primary sites: the breast, cervix, colon, endometrium, thyroid gland, skin (melanoma), ovary, and pancreas. No significant global differences in whole blood DNA methylation profiles were observed. Epigenome-wide analyses identified one novel pan-cancer differentially methylated position at false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 10Â % (cg02444695, Pâ€‰=â€‰1.8â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’7) in an intergenic region 70Â kb upstream of the SASH1 tumour suppressor gene, and three suggestive signals in COL11A2, AXL, and LINC00340. Replication of the four top-ranked signals in an independent sample of nine cancer-discordant MZ twin-pairs showed a similar direction of association at COL11A2, AXL, and LINC00340, and significantly greater methylation discordance at AXL compared to 480 healthy concordant MZ twin-pairs. The effects at cg02444695 (near SASH1), COL11A2, and LINC00340 were the most promising in biomarker potential because the DNA methylation differences were found to pre-exist in samples obtained prior to diagnosis and were limited to a 5-year period before diagnosis. Gene expression follow-up at the top-ranked signals in 283 healthy individuals showed correlation between blood methylation and gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines at PRL, and in the skin tissue at AXL. A significant enrichment of differential DNA methylation was observed in enhancer regions (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03).ConclusionsWe identified DNA methylation signatures in blood associated with pan-cancer, at or near SASH1, COL11A2, AXL, and LINC00340. Three of these signals were present up to 5Â years prior to cancer diagnosis, highlighting the potential clinical utility of whole blood DNA methylation analysis in cancer surveillance.",2016,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Leonie Roos"", ids = ""47299609""); list(name = ""Jenny van Dongen"", ids = ""35909071""); list(name = ""Christopher G.

Keratoconus (KC) is the most common corneal ectasia. We aimed to determine the differential expression of coding and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human corneas affected with KC.


Methods
From the corneas of 10 KC patients and 8 non-KC healthy controls, 200 ng total RNA was used to prepare sequencing libraries with the SMARTer Stranded RNA-Seq kit after ribosomal RNA depletion, followed by paired-end 50-bp sequencing with Illumina Sequencer. Differential analysis was done using TopHat/Cufflinks with a gene file from Ensembl and a lncRNA file from NONCODE. Pathway analysis was performed using WebGestalt. Using the expression level of differentially expressed coding and noncoding RNAs in each sample, we correlated their expression levels in KC and controls separately and identified significantly different correlations in KC against controls followed by visualization using Cytoscape.


Results
Using |fold change| â‰¥ 2 and a false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05, we identified 436 coding RNAs and 584 lncRNAs with differential expression in the KC-affected corneas. Pathway analysis indicated the enrichment of genes involved in extracellular matrix, protein binding, glycosaminoglycan binding, and cell migration. Our correlation analysis identified 296 pairs of significant KC-specific correlations containing 117 coding genes enriched in functions related to cell migration/motility, extracellular space, cytokine response, and cell adhesion. Our study highlighted the potential roles of several genes (CTGF, SFRP1, AQP5, lnc-WNT4-2:1, and lnc-ALDH3A2-2:1) and pathways (TGF-Î², WNT signaling, and PI3K/AKT pathways) in KC pathogenesis.

In the case of two factors, three separate null hypotheses are subject to test (i.e., two main effects and one interaction). Consequently, the probability of at least one Type I error (if all null hypotheses are true) is 14 % rather than 5 %, if the three tests are independent. We explain the multiple-comparison problem and demonstrate that researchers almost never correct for it. To mitigate the problem, we describe four remedies: the omnibus F test, control of the familywise error rate, control of the false discovery rate, and preregistration of the hypotheses.",2014,Mathematics; Psychology,"list(name = ""AngÃ©lique O J Cramer"", ids = ""50405188""); list(name = ""van Don Ravenzwaaij"", ids = ""72900920""); list(name = ""DÃ³ra Matzke"", ids = ""2265714""); list(name = ""Helen Steingroever"", ids = ""4114433""); list(name = ""Ruud Wetzels"", ids = ""108270700""); list(name = ""Raoul P.

3c6312c65506115954ab408c7f795705972815d9,Image-defined risk factors for nephrectomy in patients undergoing neuroblastoma resection.,"BACKGROUND
Although nephrectomy rates are higher in children with neuroblastoma who have image-defined risk factors and/or high-risk disease who undergo resection prior to chemotherapy, no published data outline the key radiographic and clinical characteristics associated with nephrectomy.


METHODS
With IRB approval, imaging studies of children undergoing primary resection of intraabdominal neuroblastoma between 2000 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively, with p-values adjusted for multiple testing using the false discovery rate approach.


RESULTS
Twenty-seven of 380 consecutive patients with CT imaging obtained prior to primary neuroblastoma resection underwent partial or total nephrectomy. On preoperative imaging, renal vessel narrowing and encasement and tumor invasion of the renal hilum, pelvis, and/or parenchyma were present significantly more frequently among patients undergoing nephrectomy. Delayed renal excretion of contrast, hydronephrosis, and tumors with MYCN amplification were also more prevalent in the nephrectomy group.


CONCLUSION
Encasement and narrowing of renal vessels, delayed excretion, and tumor invasion into the kidney, particularly pelvis and capsule invasion, are significantly associated with partial or total nephrectomy at initial neuroblastoma resection. These observations provide valuable information for surgical planning as well as presurgical discussions with families prior to neuroblastoma resection.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Irene Isabel P.

Recent neuroimaging studies have indicated that some brain areas are involved in the sexual behavior process. Premature ejaculation patients exhibite altered brain activation and abnormal cortical structures. However, there has been no research evaluating the topological organization of structural brain network in anejaculation (AE).


METHODS
We employed diffusion tensor imaging data and graph theory to examine the whole-brain structural networks among 16 AE patients and 23 healthy controls. In addition, the results of sexual function assessment were also obtained from each patient for symptom assessment. Moreover, the relationships between these clinical features and the altered topological characteristics of AE patients were also explored.


RESULTS
Decreased clustering coefficient were found in the right amygdala, inferior temporal gyrus and left pallidum of AE. AE also showed increased path length in the right postcentral gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, putamen, pallidum and left heschl gyrus, temporal pole (superior temporal gyrus), however, these altered brain regions showed no significant differences after false discovery rate correction. Moreover, the path length between subcortical and frontal regions were increased in AE. In addition, negative correlations were found between the altered nodal parameters and the amplitudes of somatosensory evoked potentials of dorsal nerve, sympathetic skin response located in the penis.


CONCLUSION
Together, our results suggest that AE was associated with disruptions in the topological organization of structural brain networks. The decreased clustering coefficient in temporal and subcortical regions, the increased path length between subcortical and frontal regions may contribute to AE. These findings provid new insights into the the pathophysiological mechanisms of AE.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jianhuai Chen"", ids = ""5022677""); list(name = ""J. J.

589b0f0d2cb0bd1e34e943f202f6d91c5cbeb5b3,Differentiation of lobular versus ductal breast carcinomas by expression microarray analysis.,"Invasive lobular and ductal breast tumors have distinct histologies and clinical presentation. Other than altered expression of E-cadherin, little is known about the underlying biology that distinguishes the tumor subtypes. We used cDNA microarrays to identify genes differentially expressed between lobular and ductal tumors. Unsupervised clustering of tumors failed to distinguish between the two subtypes. Prediction analysis for microarrays (PAM) was able to predict tumor type with an accuracy of 93.7%. Genes that were significantly differentially expressed between the two groups were identified by MaxT permutation analysis using t tests (20 cDNA clones and 10 unique genes), significance analysis for microarrays (33 cDNA clones and 15 genes, at an estimated false discovery rate of 2%), and PAM (31 cDNAs and 15 genes). There were 8 genes identified by all three of these related methods (E-cadherin, survivin, cathepsin B, TPI1, SPRY1, SCYA14, TFAP2B, and thrombospondin 4), and an additional 3 that were identified by significance analysis for microarrays and PAM (osteopontin, HLA-G, and CHC1). To validate the differential expression of these genes, 7 of them were tested by real-time quantitative PCR, which verified that they were differentially expressed in lobular versus ductal tumors. In conclusion, specific changes in gene expression distinguish lobular from ductal breast carcinomas. These genes may be important in understanding the basis of phenotypic differences among breast cancers.",2003,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""James Korkola"", ids = ""2701013""); list(name = ""Sandy Devries"", ids = ""144072663""); list(name = ""Jane Fridlyand"", ids = ""2711125""); list(name = ""E.

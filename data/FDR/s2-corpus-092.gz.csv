37eaedeeee866eeea88e775333ff6a686ae791d2,A Healthy Nordic Diet Alters the Plasma Lipidomic Profile in Adults with Features of Metabolic Syndrome in a Multicenter Randomized Dietary Intervention.,"BACKGROUND
A healthy Nordic diet is associated with improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, but the effect on lipidomic profile is not known.


OBJECTIVE
The aim was to investigate how a healthy Nordic diet affects the fasting plasma lipidomic profile in subjects with metabolic syndrome.


METHODS
Men and women (n = 200) with features of metabolic syndrome [mean age: 55 y; body mass index (in kg/m2): 31.6] were randomly assigned to either a healthy Nordic (n = 104) or a control (n = 96) diet for 18 or 24 wk at 6 centers. Of the participants, 156 completed the study with plasma lipidomic measurements. The healthy Nordic diet consisted of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, berries, vegetable oils and margarines, fish, low-fat milk products, and low-fat meat. An average Nordic diet served as the control diet and included low-fiber cereal products, dairy fat-based spreads, regular-fat milk products, and a limited amount of fruits, vegetables, and berries. Lipidomic profiles were measured at baseline, week 12, and the end of the intervention (18 or 24 wk) by using ultraperformance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The effects of the diets on the lipid variables were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. Data from centers with 18- or 24-wk duration were also analyzed separately.


RESULTS
Changes in 21 plasma lipids differed significantly between the groups at week 12 (false discovery rate P < 0.05), including increases in plasmalogens and decreases in ceramides in the healthy Nordic diet group compared with the control group. At the end of the study, changes in lipidomic profiles did not differ between the groups. However, when the intervention lasted 24 wk, changes in 8 plasma lipids that had been identified at 12 wk, including plasmalogens, were sustained. There were no differences in changes in plasma lipids between groups with an intervention of 18 wk. By the dietary biomarker score, adherence to diet did not explain the difference in the results related to the duration of the study.


CONCLUSIONS
A healthy Nordic diet transiently modified the plasma lipidomic profile, specifically by increasing the concentrations of antioxidative plasmalogens and decreasing insulin resistance-inducing ceramides.

78ac4e3b07a8f4de15bbd26dcc91c1c620bfd820,Detection of active transposable elements in Arabidopsis thaliana using Oxford Nanopore Sequencing technology,"BackgroundTransposables elements (TEs) contribute to both structural and functional dynamics of most eukaryotic genomes. Because of their propensity to densely populate plant and animal genomes, the precise estimation of the impact of transposition on genomic diversity has been considered as one of the main challenges of todayâ€™s genomics. The recent development of NGS (next generation sequencing) technologies has open new perspectives in population genomics by providing new methods for high throughput detection of Transposable Elements-associated Structural Variants (TEASV). However, these have relied on Illumina platform that generates short reads (up to 350 nucleotides). This limitation in size of sequence reads can cause high false discovery rate (FDR) and therefore limit the power of detection of TEASVs, especially in the case of large, complex genomes. The newest sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) can generate kilobases-long reads thus representing a promising tool for TEASV detection in plant and animals.ResultsWe present the results of a pilot experiment for TEASV detection on the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana using ONT sequencing and show that it can be used efficiently to detect TE movements. We generated a ~0.8X genome coverage of a met1-derived epigenetic recombinant inbred line (epiRIL) using a MinIon device with R7 chemistry. We were able to detect nine new copies of the LTR-retrotransposon EvadÃ© (EVD). We also evidenced the activity of the DNA transposon CACTA, CAC1.ConclusionsEven at a low sequence coverage (0.8X), ONT sequencing allowed us to reliably detect several TE insertions in Arabidopsis thaliana genome. The long read length allowed a precise and un-ambiguous mapping of the structural variations caused by the activity of TEs. This suggests that the trade-off between read length and genome coverage for TEASV detection may be in favor of the former. Should the technology be further improved both in terms of lower error rate and operation costs, it could be efficiently used in diversity studies at population level.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Emilie Debladis"", ids = ""5298242""); list(name = ""Christel Llauro"", ids = ""5702121""); list(name = ""Marie-Christine Carpentier"", ids = ""50168885""); list(name = ""Marie Mirouze"", ids = ""6441792""); list(name = ""Olivier Panaud"", ids = ""1887941"")",2f90209e644422ddb050536e9360fb1726ef894e; c98f9fb04653cf61ce0a94a6dd636f29d0c16420; 275622c0ee1ce583240c2b3ebcad6eaf4ff3a46d; 1d7c8edb6eb6db85581c13eb84e0a56da40ae7ac; 1573a18bb7eacce435716bcf805d6c5663da558d; 83d59098b0c8412aead889521c16645ebb0ddd93; 4077b1a2ff9d802816fcc21771e01dce8229da39; 017116404e80b8c782c8b5721b82183308ff3065; c8cfc814b70ef2b6dfd8bcc08e4b505ae9a4e4e1; 8fceba38048d48716eaa203035b3ab3bb2f0d8fe; f0d2319f47f7becb624160d82473a62ba3b321ef; 0d5d0f40018bff1e11b3c7600482b5151652efa0; 7f4500202eed5d8b5647ad9287822f41e6b5ec0c; 7ba18c8c3670d5b0d0bc41626840fef3756aa573; c71b0f8f304f8bcfbe9d8274fb03099c12f625d0; 7c614c26c027fdc189048827064acdc6cb3794de,2d44834cc2043a9be06803e15ca0ba50f3b1d1e1; 4dd42112bf3ec0e6ae0563499903a3f2bdc9a1a0; 086109d2a8baaee54f51d155860c1c1413d361d4; 4319e5123b308a5c4a4fea4005650ff7893d3e4f; 2ec34500cf1d4db26f03ea6bdb4a55a969ad8f9f; 49dde8641a28a59c6d9fc2324afbae553efe91e5; 132b73619b2e34b9cd8a5c4c6fc75d72b5609f28; 855d8da9a8f8972228e637c998b44d89c80728b6; 7fb0bbffdb5031e7867a4948a8f315719fb1617d; fd0690addf3a4917da35fa2d4e555b22651c9a29; 041e51b7931029b468bb13e28afda9208c8fa78d; 22944e3c9e00137c85163ad9a9915632bcb65b18; 4e973ffcf613687c90d2ec42de0e5c7e27c8d126; 12e02f11f29010849cfac242a45f705f5e0f7677; 6b781f595ad87bb6d50837e4d4c4984963490a6c; bbdf71bc60846c1e95d3672d7f238aeb030935ef; be08214c346fc8aa528eb56f2a93415973bffd1f; 9bb728438f25e8c5bee73cf524519fafd985936c; c1aebcd607aaf4a90f61738cb0e067225d6a5f50; c9822d68e54990cd24bbfbd981e43ea9898d96ec; 8a1fc4b071c076c3bcc0ab88ed7f593e09df9e93; 28b81f1e88161b51562a4786ecf078c09bdb2e5c; dd531d9e3b239d68bc0c83b79ffdf92454a21f55; 9d4c4ee38267a6ee342bc9e29e90c284deeeaaf3; c1fc3c108341800d432e9f004e5f6bab4fa3b262,BMC Genomics,18,
df6c03701cd9822de9b3ec791ddf9d22cac953bc,Immune-related genetic enrichment in frontotemporal dementia,"Background Converging evidence suggests that immune-mediated dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Although genetic studies have shown that immune-associated loci are associated with increased FTD risk, a systematic investigation of genetic overlap between immune-mediated diseases and the spectrum of FTD-related disorders has not been performed. Methods and findings Using large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (total n = 192,886 cases and controls) and recently developed tools to quantify genetic overlap/pleiotropy, we systematically identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with â€˜FTD-related disordersâ€™ namely FTD, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) â€“ and one or more immune-mediated diseases including Crohnâ€™s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), celiac disease (CeD), and psoriasis (PSOR). We found up to 270-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and RA and comparable enrichment between FTD and UC, T1D, and CeD. In contrast, we found only modest genetic enrichment between any of the immune-mediated diseases and CBD, PSP or ALS. At a conjunction false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, we identified numerous FTD-immune pleiotropic SNPs within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6. By leveraging the immune diseases, we also found novel FTD susceptibility loci within LRRK2 (Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2), TBKBP1 (TANK-binding kinase 1 Binding Protein 1), and PGBD5 (PiggyBac Transposable Element Derived 5). Functionally, we found that expression of FTD-immune pleiotropic genes (particularly within the HLA region) is altered in postmortem brain tissue from patients with frontotemporal dementia and is enriched in microglia compared to other central nervous system (CNS) cell types. Conclusions We show considerable immune-mediated genetic enrichment specifically in FTD, particularly within the HLA region. Our genetic results suggest that for a subset of patients, immune dysfunction may contribute to risk for FTD. These findings have potential implications for clinical trials targeting immune dysfunction in patients with FTD.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Iris Broce"", ids = ""49770104""); list(name = ""Celeste M.

As TZD agem como um agente sensibilizador da acao da insulina nos tecidos perifericos e tem sido especulado que as TZDs podem ter um papel na funcao da celula , prevenindo perda de massa e melhorando a sua viabilidade a longo prazo. Este efeito seria supostamente mediado pela transcricao de genes que favoreceriam a lipolise, diminuindo o conteudo intracelular de triglicerides e, portanto, diminuindo a lipotoxicidade. Entretanto, alguns estudos tambem mostraram efeito nulo ou mesmo deleterio das TZDs sobre as ilhotas pancreaticas. Na realidade, o papel de genes-alvo para o PPAR- nas ilhotas pancreaticas e ainda pouco conhecido. Estudamos o perfil de expressao genica induzido pelo tratamento com Pioglitazona (Pio), uma TZD aprovada e disponivel para uso clinico no tratamento do DM2, em ilhotas pancreaticas murideas em cultura primaria, com concentracoes normal e suprafisiologica de glicose no meio de cultura. As ilhotas foram obtidas de ratos wistar machos de dois meses de idade e isoladas pelo metodo do gradiente de Ficoll e entao cultivadas em 5,6 mM ou 23 mM de glicose por 24h, sendo tratadas com Pio 10 M ou DMSO 0,1% (veiculo). A Pioglitazona foi cedida pela Takeda Farmaceutica, Osaka, Japao. O RNA foi extraido com Trizol e purificado com o kit RNeasy (Qiagen). As amostras foram marcadas e hibridizadas no microarranjo de cDNA Mouse Panchip 13k, usando-se cinco replicatas biologicas diferentes para cada condicao. A analise estatistica dos dados do microarranjo foi feita com o uso do programa significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) com uso de taxa de descobrimento falso (FDR) de 20%.

Peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor-a (PPAR-a) is a target for thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic drugs and a regulator of adipose tissue differentiation and metabolism. TZD act as an insulin sensitizing agent on peripheral tissues. It has been speculated that TZD could play a role on beta-cell function, preventing loss and improving viability in the long-term. This effect is supposed to be mediated through a potential benefit against lipotoxicity, favouring lypolisis and decreasing intracellular tryglicerides content. Nevertheless some studies also showed a lack or even a potential deleterious effect of TZD on islets. The role of PPAR-a target genes in pancreatic islets is actually still largely unclear. We studied the gene expression profile induced by the treatment with Pioglitazone (Pio), an approved TZD for T2DM therapy, on rat pancreatic islets primary culture both at normal and supraphysiological glucose medium concentrations. Islets were obtained from 2 month-old, male, wistar rats and isolated through the Ficoll gradient method and then cultured with 5.6 mM or 23 mM of glucose concentration for 24h, being treated with Pio 10 iM or DMSO 0.1% (vehicle). Pioglitazone was provided by Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Osaka, Japan. RNA was extracted with Trizol (Sigma) and purified with RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Samples were labeled and then hybridized on the Mouse PanChip 13k cDNA microarray, using 5 different biological replicates for each test condition.

c5d562b20c2c6eb429b0ea5e67bea2beca157123,Gender-specific differences in expression in human lymphoblastoid cell lines.,"Women and men have different risks for certain diseases and they often respond differently to treatment. These differences could be due to the sex-specific differences in the expression of genes related to primary disease susceptibility or pharmacodynamic targets. To evaluate the sex-specific pattern of gene expression, we compared gene expression levels using a publicly available microarray dataset of 233 (115 women and 118 men) lymphoblastoid cell lines. From the 4799 probes meeting a specified minimal level of expression, 10 genes (P<0.005, permutation adjusted false discovery rate less than 50%) located on autosomal chromosomes were identified using a permutation-based approach. These genes were found to be over-represented in certain gene ontology terms of biological process (cell adhesion, apoptosis, transcription and signal transduction), and molecular function (structural molecule activity, zinc ion binding, transcription factor activity and protein binding). A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis indicated that two known pathways are over-represented: adherens junction and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""50549803""); list(name = ""Wasim K.

In association studies performing statistical tests for a large number of correlated markers, the traditional Sidak correction is overly conservative and the permutation test is inefficient. This article discusses recently proposed approaches for correcting for multiple testing in association studies. We first explain basic concepts of statistics such as the p-value, false-positive rate, corrected p-value and family wise error rate. Then we discuss recently proposed methods in three categories: methods using multivariate normal distribution, methods calculating the effective number of tests and methods increasing the efficiency of permutation test. We compare the relative performance of these methods. Many of the methods are shown to be highly efficient and accurate compared to the traditional approaches and can readily be applied to the genome-wide datasets.

Fear-related responses to Î±2-adrenergic challenge were therefore studied in DxH C3H/HeJ-like recombinant inbred (C3HLRI) mice, which are a DBA/2J-congenic strain selectively bred for a high fear-sensitized startle (H-FSS). C3HLRI mice showed an enhanced acoustic startle response and immobility in the forced swim test compared to DBA/2J controls. The Î±2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (Yoh; 5.0â€¯mg/kg) induced an anxiogenic and the Î±2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (Clon; 0.1â€¯mg/kg) an anxiolytic effect in the open field (OF) in C3HLRI but not DBA/2J mice. In auditory fear-conditioning, Yoh (5.0â€¯mg/kg)-treated C3HLRI mice showed higher freezing during fear recall and extinction learning than DBA/2J mice, and a higher ceiling for the Yoh-induced deficit in fear extinction. No strain differences were observed in exploration-related anxiety/spatial learning or the Clon-induced (0.1â€¯mg/kg) corticosterone surge. A global analysis of the behavioral profile of the two mouse strains based on observed and expected numbers of significant behavioral outcomes indicated that C3HLRI mice showed significantly more often fear- and stress-related PTSD-like behaviors than DBA/2J controls. The analysis of the robustness of significant outcomes based on false discovery rate (FDR) thresholds confirmed significant differences for the strain-Yoh-interactions in the OF center and periphery, the Yoh-induced general extinction deficit, strain differences in conditioned fear levels, and at the dose of 5.0â€¯mg/kg for the Yoh-induced ceiling in freezing levels among others. The current findings are consistent with previous observations showing alterations in the central noradrenergic system of C3HLRI mice (Browne et al., 2014, Stress 17:471-83). Based on their behavioral profile and response to Î±2-adrenergic stimulation, C3HLRI mice are a valuable genetic model for studying adrenergic mechanisms of anxiety disorders and potentially also of PTSD.",2020,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rochelle N.

d9869a237306376a26dc6bf59db346b2a1445000,Diffusion tensor imaging and ventricle volume quantification in patients with chronic shunt-treated hydrocephalus: a matched case-control study.,"OBJECTIVEThe object of this study was to use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to characterize the long-term effects of hydrocephalus and shunting on white matter integrity and to investigate the relationship of ventricular size and alterations in white matter integrity with headache and quality-of-life outcome measures.METHODSPatients with shunt-treated hydrocephalus and age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited into the study and underwent anatomical and DTI imaging on a 3-T MRI scanner. All patients were clinically stable, had undergone CSF shunt placement before 2 years of age, and had a documented history of complaints of headaches. Outcome was scored based on the Headache Disability Inventory and the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and other DTI-based measures (axial, radial, and mean diffusivity; AD, RD, and MD, respectively) were extracted in the corpus callosum and internal capsule with manual region-of-interest delineation and in other regions with TBSS. Paired t-tests, corrected with a 5% false discovery rate, were used to identify regions with significant differences between patients and controls. Within the patient group, linear regression models were used to investigate the relationship between FA or ventricular volume and outcome, as well as the effect of shunt-related covariates.RESULTSTwenty-one hydrocephalus patients and 21 matched controls completed the study, and their data were used in the final analysis. The authors found significantly lower FA for patients than for controls in 20 of the 48 regions, mostly posterior white matter structures, in periventricular as well as more distal tracts. Of these 20 regions, 17 demonstrated increased RD, while only 5 showed increased MD and 3 showed decreased AD. No areas of increased FA were observed. Higher FA in specific periventricular white matter tracts, tending toward FA in controls, was associated with increased ventricular size, as well as improved clinical outcome.CONCLUSIONSThe study shows that TBSS-based DTI is a sensitive technique for elucidating changes in white matter structures due to hydrocephalus and chronic CSF shunting and provides preliminary evidence that DTI may be a valuable tool for tailoring shunt procedures to monitor ventricular size following shunting and achieve optimal outcome, as well as for guiding the development of alternate therapies for hydrocephalus.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kristy Tan"", ids = ""48445792""); list(name = ""Avital Meiri"", ids = ""48588642""); list(name = ""Wenzhu B Mowrey"", ids = ""2511975""); list(name = ""Rick Abbott"", ids = ""5682005""); list(name = ""James Tait Goodrich"", ids = ""34264948""); list(name = ""Adam L.

798b1540939c408272bab2b4dd732f54dae2e1ae,Association Analysis of SLC6A20 Polymorphisms With Hirschsprung Disease.,"PURPOSE
Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital and heterogeneous disorder, which is caused by no neuronal ganglion cells in part or all of distal gastrointestinal tract. Recently, our genome-wide association study has identified solute carrier family 6, proline IMINO transporter, member 20 (SLC6A20) as one of the potential risk factors for HSCR development. This study performed a replication study for the association of SLC6A20 polymorphisms with HSCR and an extended analysis to investigate further associations for subgroups and haplotypes.


METHODS
For the replication study, a total of 40 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SLC6A20 were genotyped in 187 HSCR subjects composed of 121 short-segment HSCR, 45 long-segment HSCR (L-HSCR), 21 total colonic aganglionosis, and 283 unaffected controls. Imputation was performed using genotype data from our genome-wide association study and this replication study.


RESULTS
Imputed meta-analysis revealed that 13 SLC6A20 SNPs (minimum P = 0.0002 at rs6770261) were significantly associated with HSCR even after correction for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR) (minimum PFDR =â€Š .005). In further subgroup analysis, SLC6A20 polymorphisms appeared to have increased associations with L-HSCR. Moreover, haplotype analysis also showed significant associations between 2 haplotypes (BL3_ht2 and BL4_ht2) and HSCR susceptibility (PFDR <â€Š .05).


CONCLUSIONS
Although further replications and functional evaluations are required, our results suggest that SLC6A20 may have roles in HSCR development and in the extent of aganglionic segment during enteric nervous system development.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jin Sol Lee"", ids = ""3624379""); list(name = ""Jung-Tak Oh"", ids = ""71046167""); list(name = ""Jeong-Hyun Kim"", ids = ""47964289""); list(name = ""Jeong-meen Seo"", ids = ""3612436""); list(name = ""Dae-Yeon Kim"", ids = ""2365687""); list(name = ""Kwi-Won Park"", ids = ""4380513""); list(name = ""Hyun-Young Kim"", ids = ""39605221""); list(name = ""Kyuwhan Jung"", ids = ""7015041""); list(name = ""Byung lae Park"", ids = ""145367301""); list(name = ""Insong Koh"", ids = ""145753555""); list(name = ""Hyoung Doo Shin"", ids = ""4260580"")",9ae3ff5451d6cf0f3765b677baf7a87eca100e7c; c2ce658a394c7c879b78b374a2428579502429bd; 3940fcffd71335a9aa245c547baa574e997c332d,ebddea4484ce32e4b5b555b0de9a66cfa5245937; 4d7f3fa72162064c14f8b882b52cc53357afabdb; 88ee27f4ccde28b8d739ee7c33bba31c44fffe00; ba367de43edaa80afc891fb07344695c1cc4f595; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; d3e5a8874e998723b09fab1e4175f9c7f5a7aba2; 1b2dd5b04ddb7adc8196649c22c6e37202e8a7d8; 3fa2a77d7368c773c9ac05181f0088d8e12a3f36; cc58f05fe1952b12c87b21c693806148843000be; ee466f5cc1fd1a93089276aa31a979e3cfd78b19; 5f8f55c25d628f5f1bc496d236e556ece2a9ff18; 0da09959e28519d1f1cabfdc9482d692c5567320; f53e4ae4cbabd98518b6e3c9051856889b0907be; 05af5177dd75b2cbe8aef97b9ae06284d939da13; bad4d76bd086b0617a1012f79da5d43748afd0c0; aa02ed7d2a7f2048cb3f4937130092b497bfe5c0; 75b2531f74dc11bdf75adcb5bf38923ba4406eec; 0597e1d083fa8570cfd99d706f8eca54e103371d; f4e62750b13722e55326dc63a222b62f6181abab; a0e6ce01efc39a952a18bf79361518a58c2a7116; abe4543bccd2d7ea849cba120ebb3397aef15857; 7033e1de74cf67deda3622ba9114eb028093ffc5; 351c6288f8c89e397f5b54d4426aedee692e8d23; d60cada22ee16406a5382361ffbe42b91362ec71; b14f09302be8d61c26331638f1d56a06c69cf42e; 82f6a4d0b7957177b3766f4ccd8492e8e801ef82; f475fdc43303e6fa61b8f2d0acf28ac752707320; 200310d72af3c8828174f48387ce75563be6e92d; 9450d5d35ff8421bdd9924c010e1d4993cc47b27; 328db31a9a78e5a1bdc5f13406f31526e4176652; 26d8bb259e1746e11caaade1458b4a63d6a17dd3,Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,62 1,"

4477aef29486526f051ddb7bd87593cfe18099a9,Detecting Large Indels Using Optical Map Data,"Optical Maps (OM) provide reads that are very long, and thus can be used to detect large indels not detectable by the shorter reads provided by sequence-based technologies such as Illumina and PacBio. Two existing tools for detecting large indels from OM data are BioNano Solve and OMSV. However, these two tools may miss indels with weak signals. We propose a local-assembly based approach, OMIndel, to detect large indels with OM data. The results of applying OMIndel to empirical data demonstrate that it is able to detect indels with weak signal. Furthermore, compared with the other two OM-based methods, OMIndel has a lower false discovery rate. We also investigated the indels that can only be detected by OM but not Illumina, PacBio or 10X, and we found that they mostly fall into two categories: complex events or indels on repetitive regions. This implies that adding the OM data to sequence-based technologies can provide significant progress towards a more complete characterization of structural variants (SVs).

e5d1fbb6631d000861d10b5058937199c2f6bebb,Phenotypic and transcriptional response to selection for alcohol sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster,"BackgroundAlcoholism is a complex disorder determined by interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors. Drosophila represents a powerful model system to dissect the genetic architecture of alcohol sensitivity, as large numbers of flies can readily be reared in defined genetic backgrounds and under controlled environmental conditions. Furthermore, flies exposed to ethanol undergo physiological and behavioral changes that resemble human alcohol intoxication, including loss of postural control, sedation, and development of tolerance.ResultsWe performed artificial selection for alcohol sensitivity for 35 generations and created duplicate selection lines that are either highly sensitive or resistant to ethanol exposure along with unselected control lines. We used whole genome expression analysis to identify 1,678 probe sets with different expression levels between the divergent lines, pooled across replicates, at a false discovery rate of q < 0.001. We assessed to what extent genes with altered transcriptional regulation might be causally associated with ethanol sensitivity by measuring alcohol sensitivity of 37 co-isogenic P-element insertional mutations in 35 candidate genes, and found that 32 of these mutants differed in sensitivity to ethanol exposure from their co-isogenic controls. Furthermore, 23 of these novel genes have human orthologues.ConclusionCombining whole genome expression profiling with selection for genetically divergent lines is an effective approach for identifying candidate genes that affect complex traits, such as alcohol sensitivity. Because of evolutionary conservation of function, it is likely that human orthologues of genes affecting alcohol sensitivity in Drosophila may contribute to alcohol-associated phenotypes in humans.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Tatiana V.

790d24a914d694ec9bba8d08ae346a84740afac1,Alteration of HDL Protein Composition with Hemodialysis Initiation.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
HDL particles obtained from patients on chronic hemodialysis exhibit lower cholesterol efflux capacity and are enriched in inflammatory proteins compared with those in healthy individuals. Observed alterations in HDL proteins could be due to effects of CKD, but also may be influenced by the hemodialysis procedure, which stimulates proinflammatory and prothrombotic pathways.


DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS
We compared HDL-associated proteins in 143 participants who initiated hemodialysis within the previous year with those of 110 participants with advanced CKD from the Hemodialysis Fistula Maturation Study. We quantified concentrations of 38 HDL-associated proteins relative to total HDL protein using targeted mass spectrometry assays that included a stable isotope-labeled internal standard. We used linear regression to compare the relative abundances of HDL-associated proteins after adjustment and required a false discovery rate q value â‰¤10% to control for multiple testing. We further assessed the association between hemodialysis initiation and cholesterol efflux capacity in a subset of 80 participants.


RESULTS
After adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and other clinical characteristics, eight HDL-associated proteins met the prespecified false discovery threshold for association. Recent hemodialysis initiation was associated with higher HDL-associated concentrations of serum amyloid A1, A2, and A4; hemoglobin-Î²; haptoglobin-related protein; cholesterylester transfer protein; phospholipid transfer protein; and apo E. The trend for participants recently initiating hemodialysis for lower cholesterol efflux capacity compared with individuals with advanced CKD did not reach statistical significance.


CONCLUSIONS
Compared with advanced CKD, hemodialysis initiation within the previous year is associated with higher concentrations of eight HDL proteins related to inflammation and lipid metabolism. Identified associations differ from those recently observed for nondialysis-requiring CKD. Hemodialysis initiation may further impair cholesterol efflux capacity. Further work is needed to clarify the clinical significance of the identified proteins with respect to cardiovascular risk.

c823b52b0555a54fe1229c82012fa93c8c08c253,Using texture analysis of head CT images to differentiate osteoporosis from normal bone density.,"OBJECTIVES
To investigate the use of texture analysis for the detection of osteoporosis on noncontrast head CTs, and to explore optimal sampling regions within the craniofacial bones.


METHODS
In this IRB-approved, retrospective study, the clivus, bilateral sphenoid triangles and mandibular condyles were manually segmented on each noncontrast head CT, and 41 textures features were extracted from 29 patients with normal bone density (NBD); and 29 patients with osteoporosis. Basic descriptive statistics including a false discovery rate correction were performed to evaluate for differences in texture features between the cohorts.


RESULS
Sixteen texture features demonstrated significant differences (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) between NBD and osteoporosis in the clivus including 4 histogram features, 2 gray-level co-occurrence matrix features, 8 gray-level run-length features and 2 Law's features. Nineteen texture features including 9 histogram features, 1 GLCM features, 2 GLRL features, 5 Law's features and 2 GLGM features demonstrated statistically significant differences in both sides of the sphenoid triangles. A total 24 texture features demonstrated statistically significant differences between normal BMD and osteoporosis in the left sphenoid and a total of 31 texture features in the left condyle. Furthermore, a total of 22 texture features including 6 histogram features, 3 GLCM features, 9 GLRL features, 2 Law's features and 2 GLGM features demonstrated statistically significant differences in both sides of the mandibular condyles.


CONCLUSION
The results of this investigation suggest that specific texture analysis features derived from regions of interest placed within multiple sites within the skull base and maxillofacial bones can distinguish between patients with normal bone mineral density compared to those with osteoporosis. This study demonstrates the potential utility of a texture analysis for identification of osteoporosis on head CT, which may help identify patients who have not undergone screening with traditional DXA.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yusuke Kawashima"", ids = ""50564705""); list(name = ""Akifumi Fujita"", ids = ""144110539""); list(name = ""Karen Buch"", ids = ""47198243""); list(name = ""Baojun Li"", ids = ""48219043""); list(name = ""Muhammad Mohsin Qureshi"", ids = ""120035902""); list(name = ""M N Chapman"", ids = ""145030623""); list(name = ""Osamu Sakai"", ids = ""145597701"")",3042bf7cf985441f0cb1ed4cd7bcad3f3903840b; 9f6bdf5bb8f9c406e7ef2f19e002514f306a3c4a,,European journal of radiology,116,"

c8463c8877f6c0c74d256ed0bb1515307cc1366b,A prospective evaluation of plasma phospholipid fatty acids and breast cancer risk in the EPIC study,"Background
Intakes of specific fatty acids have been postulated to impact breast cancer risk but epidemiological data based on dietary questionnaires remain conflicting.


Materials and methods
We assessed the association between plasma phospholipid fatty acids and breast cancer risk in a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. Sixty fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography in pre-diagnostic plasma phospholipids from 2982 incident breast cancer cases matched to 2982 controls. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate relative risk of breast cancer by fatty acid level. The false discovery rate (q values) was computed to control for multiple comparisons. Subgroup analyses were carried out by estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor expression in the tumours.


Results
A high level of palmitoleic acid [odds ratio (OR) for the highest quartile compared with the lowest OR (Q4-Q1) 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.14-1.64; P for trendâ€‰=â€‰0.0001, q valueâ€‰=â€‰0.004] as well as a high desaturation index (DI16) (16:1n-7/16:0) [OR (Q4-Q1), 1.28; 95% C, 1.07-1.54; P for trendâ€‰=â€‰0.002, q valueâ€‰=â€‰0.037], as biomarkers of de novo lipogenesis, were significantly associated with increased risk of breast cancer. Levels of industrial trans-fatty acids were positively associated with ER-negative tumours [OR for the highest tertile compared with the lowest (T3-T1)=2.01; 95% CI, 1.03-3.90; P for trendâ€‰=â€‰0.047], whereas no association was found for ER-positive tumours (P-heterogeneityâ€‰=0.01). No significant association was found between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and breast cancer risk, overall or by hormonal receptor.


Conclusion
These findings suggest that increased de novo lipogenesis, acting through increased synthesis of palmitoleic acid, could be a relevant metabolic pathway for breast tumourigenesis.

59a887e16eefe04da14625213ccef57224f0640d,A two-step method for variable selection in the analysis of a case-cohort study,"Background
Accurate detection and estimation of true exposure-outcome associations is important in aetiological analysis; when there are multiple potential exposure variables of interest, methods for detecting the subset of variables most likely to have true associations with the outcome of interest are required. Case-cohort studies often collect data on a large number of variables which have not been measured in the entire cohort (e.g. panels of biomarkers). There is a lack of guidance on methods for variable selection in case-cohort studies.


Methods
We describe and explore the application of three variable selection methods to data from a case-cohort study. These are: (i) selecting variables based on their level of significance in univariable (i.e. one-at-a-time) Prentice-weighted Cox regression models; (ii) stepwise selection applied to Prentice-weighted Cox regression; and (iii) a two-step method which applies a Bayesian variable selection algorithm to obtain posterior probabilities of selection for each variable using multivariable logistic regression followed by effect estimation using Prentice-weighted Cox regression.


Results
Across nine different simulation scenarios, the two-step method demonstrated higher sensitivity and lower false discovery rate than the one-at-a-time and stepwise methods. In an application of the methods to data from the EPIC-InterAct case-cohort study, the two-step method identified an additional two fatty acids as being associated with incident type 2 diabetes, compared with the one-at-a-time and stepwise methods.


Conclusions
The two-step method enables more powerful and accurate detection of exposure-outcome associations in case-cohort studies.

One way to do this is to identify the features and interactions among them that contribute to a model's predictive accuracy. We present a model-agnostic approach to this task that makes the following specific contributions.

4c9cba95737c7eb79991f3d9ad2d8ca71afb0c37,Association of polymorphisms of THBS2 and HSPA8 with hypertension in Japanese individuals with chronic kidney disease.,"The purpose of the present study was to identify gene polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to hypertension in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), thereby contributing to the prediction of genetic risk for this condition. The study population comprised 1824 Japanese individuals with CKD [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml min-1 1.73 m-2], including 1257 subjects with hypertension and 567 controls. The genotypes for 50 polymorphisms of 46 candidate genes were determined using a method that combines the polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes with suspension array technology. An initial screen of allele frequencies by the Ï‡2 test revealed that two polymorphisms were significantly (false discovery rate <0.05) associated with the prevalence of hypertension in individuals with CKD. Subsequent multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, gender and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus revealed that these two polymorphisms, 3949Tâ†·G (3'-UTR) of the thrombospondin 2 gene (THBS2; odds ratio in recessive model, 8.31) and -110Aâ†·C of the heat shock 70-kDa protein 8 gene (HSPA8; odds ratio in recessive model, 0.72) were significantly (P<0.05) associated with the prevalence of hypertension. The variant G allele of THBS2 was a risk factor for hypertension, whereas the variant C allele of HSPA8 was protective against this condition. A stepwise forward selection procedure also demonstrated that the THBS2 and HSPA8 genotypes were significant (P<0.05) and independent determinants of hypertension. Determination of genotypes for these polymorphisms may prove informative for the prediction of genetic risk for hypertension in Japanese individuals with CKD. Validation of these findings will require additional studies with independent subject panels.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mitsutoshi Oguri"", ids = ""5005355""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Kiyoshi Yokoi"", ids = ""2332668""); list(name = ""Sachiro Watanabe"", ids = ""66974556""); list(name = ""Norifumi Metoki"", ids = ""6157218""); list(name = ""Hidemi Yoshida"", ids = ""35118819""); list(name = ""Kei Satoh"", ids = ""49245021""); list(name = ""Yukitoshi Aoyagi"", ids = ""5446851""); list(name = ""Yutaka Nishigaki"", ids = ""6466382""); list(name = ""Hideyo Yoshida"", ids = ""6708396""); list(name = ""Yoshinori Nozawa"", ids = ""3526189""); list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711"")",360c36b3b8315142dd6224758f2799b04b09cc93,,Molecular medicine reports,2 2,"

In aging skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative stress contributes to altered redox homeostasis. We have previously demonstrated that reducing mitochondrial oxidant production with acute (1 hr) and chronic (8 week) treatment with the peptide elamipretide (SS-31) can reverse skeletal muscle and mitochondrial dysfunction and reduce redox stress in aging mice. These improvements were also associated with increased exercise tolerance and greater fatigue resistance. However, the mechanisms by which improving mitochondrial function with SS-31 reverses age-related decline in skeletal muscle function remain unknown. To investigate the effect of SS-31 on the skeletal muscle proteome we assessed global changes in protein abundance, and phosphorylation and S-glutathionylation PTMs in young vs. aged and aged+SS-31 vs. aged mice. Osmotically regulated pumps were surgically implanted into 26-month old female C57Bl/6 mice to deliver saline or SS-31 (3mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. At the end of 8-week treatment, animals were dissected and gastrocnemius muscle was separated and flash-frozen for analysis via mass spectrometry. Seven-month old female C57Bl/mice were sacrificed as healthy young controls. Relatively few significant protein abundance changes occur with age in skeletal muscle (43) using a false discovery rate of",2018,Chemistry,"list(name = ""Matthew Campbell"", ids = ""6102809""); list(name = ""Matthew J.

82b2a1d3082ddd969969e68850e79e3631cec6e0,Early Life Depression: Social Moderation of the Influences of Neurotransmitter Candidate Genes and Physical Attractiveness,"DANIEL E. ADKINS: Early life depression: Social moderation of the influences of neurotransmitter candidate genes and physical attractiveness (Under the direction of Kenneth A. Bollen and Guang Guo) Understanding the social determinants of depression has remained a primary concern in the mental health literature for decades. Investigation into the topic has been productive, yielding a number of robust empirical findings and organizing theoretical frameworks. Thus, social scientists have made substantial progress in elucidating how social factors including stressful events, social support and socio-economic status influence depression over the life course. However, it is also clear that there are considerable individual differences in the impact of social factors, with some individuals showing greater vulnerability than others. This fact suggests that much of the variance in depression is due to interactions between social factors and personal characteristics not typically examined in social science research. This dissertation elaborates this line of reasoning, investigating social moderation of the influence of five neurotransmitter candidate genes and physical attractiveness on depression using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. In the first empirical chapter, the direct and interactive influences of candidate genes and various dimensions of social environmental risk on depression are examined. Using false discovery rate (FDR) methods to account for multiple testing, evidence suggests possible interactions between the MAOA VNTR promoter polymorphism, particularly the 2 repeat and 3.5/4 repeat variants, and social support among females.

1455976a02dd8889fb7d534700c97bf13b142ccf,Identification of novel DNA-methylated genes that correlate with human prostate cancer and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia,"Background:Prostate cancer (PCa) harbors a myriad of genomic and epigenetic defects. Cytosine methylation of CpG-rich promoter DNA is an important mechanism of epigenetic gene inactivation in PCa. There is considerable amount of data to suggest that DNA methylation-based biomarkers may be useful for the early detection and diagnosis of PCa. In addition, candidate gene-based studies have shown an association between specific gene methylation and alterations and clinicopathologic indicators of poor prognosis in PCa.Methods:To more comprehensively identify DNA methylation alterations in PCa initiation and progression, we examined the methylation status of 485â€‰577 CpG sites from regions with a broad spectrum of CpG densities, interrogating both gene-associated and non-associated regions using the recently developed Illumina 450K methylation platform.Results:In all, we selected 33 promoter-associated novel CpG sites that were differentially methylated in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and PCa in comparison with benign prostate tissue samples (false discovery rate-adjusted P-value <0.05; Î²-value â©¾0.2; fold change >1.5). Of the 33 genes, hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated BNC1, FZD1, RPL39L, SYN2, LMX1B, CXXC5, ZNF783 and CYB5R2 as top candidate novel genes that are frequently methylated and whose methylation was associated with inactivation of gene expression in PCa cell lines. Pathway analysis of the genes with altered methylation patterns identified the involvement of a cancer-related network of genes whose activity may be regulated by TP53, MYC, TNF, IL1 and 6, IFN-Î³ and FOS in prostate pathogenesis.Conclusion:Our genome-wide methylation profile shows epigenetic dysregulation of important regulatory signals in prostate carcinogenesis.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Joseph M.

5f426e8c0388dccbfcd4df86dd8cca3dae8ffcbc,Microarray data analysis for differential expression: a tutorial.,"DNA microarray is a technology that simultaneously evaluates quantitative measurements for the expression of thousands of genes. DNA microarrays have been used to assess gene expression between groups of cells of different organs or different populations. In order to understand the role and function of the genes, one needs the complete information about their mRNA transcripts and proteins. Unfortunately, exploring the protein functions is very difficult, due to their unique 3-dimentional complicated structure. To overcome this difficulty, one may concentrate on the mRNA molecules produced by the gene expression. In this paper, we describe some of the methods for preprocessing data for gene expression and for pairwise comparison from genomic experiments. Previous studies to assess the efficiency of different methods for pairwise comparisons have found little agreement in the lists of significant genes. Finally, we describe the procedures to control false discovery rates, sample size approach for these experiments, and available software for microarray data analysis. This paper is written for those professionals who are new in microarray data analysis for differential expression and want to have an overview of the specific steps or the different approaches for this sort of analysis.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Erick L SuÃ¡rez"", ids = ""144325376""); list(name = ""Ana Burguete"", ids = ""40483875""); list(name = ""gEoffREy J.

The aim of this study is to investigate distinctive correlation patterns between the gray matter volume and sleep disturbances in AD. MethodsaaThirty drug-naive patients with AD and 30 group-matched healthy control subjects underwent 3T magnetic resonance imag ing scanning, and the whole brain gray matter volumes were measured using voxel based morphometry. We explored the correlation pattern between the gray matter volumes and the sleep disturbances in AD using the sleep disturbance subscale of Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). ResultsaaSignificant negative correlations were observed between left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hypothalamus vol umes and sleep disturbance subscale of NPI (false discovery rate corrected for multiple comparisons p < 0.05). ConclusionsaaThis study was the first to explore the relationships between whole brain gray matter volumes and sleep disturbances of drug-naive patients with AD. These structural changes in DLPFC and hypothalamus might be the core of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of sleep disturbances in AD.",2014,Psychology,"list(name = ""Hyun Kook Lim"", ids = ""3260937""); list(name = ""Won sang Jung"", ids = ""3170703""); list(name = ""Jong-Hyun Jeong"", ids = ""119028109""); list(name = ""Ho-Jun Seo"", ids = ""4258713""); list(name = ""Tae-Won Kim"", ids = ""144299959""); list(name = ""Jin-Hee Han"", ids = ""122200319""); list(name = ""C Lee"", ids = ""49010476""); list(name = ""Seung Chul Hong"", ids = ""31581154"")",,8c01dda9b951efbe5077c572494979ba78a9bef9; de632d76d0217076ab7f3e129acae0c247f96fad; 6bfd30a483a4073623c901943128aa5bdf5e5dcd; f84a35de0c50e461444574290488eebdfc4a8e6c; e7ecbb39c01ee5f2124104eebb41ed9ed427a55d; 2a9436b9492d1ec6adc0b9d0e453f94c87c3842b; 3db03bfff12c55714c111fc769e59d71e3496846; f32257ded85810016dc0e898e93cf7f79c8c468e; 0081adb29a00fff363236be20ad3a531a34bc2eb; 2c0f1fc88b25e5a5fbddef1f9969e4e38a841242; 1bb67296fb2535edef111f46d1ea17caf022ff57; 8f25482d438cf561345d67e29fcc61b16d8257b6; 384c074ec0a86866085a86b0c8dfbf4791342a12; 4852db4fd9d0cd6493534a5ba6ace8b1d7a70f43; 5b79f0b63e8b84d3f02f5bfbf28804aaf9c6c93e; c0d4b86e1c0038f79bc6e621efd4d5182eb3ac7f; 7f6c9bf87399c38ea8e69871cda37a50f76a19cf; fa9e7e5541f4f4304383fe3a987b7f3270363d98; e7cefce9886a5c0a766e4065e160efc5e9746664; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; 397f18e01dcb17151622a1835c7657773a606245; 1bbb5207bab7eb694216b4c3e8bb84c7536e0be2; d44c56551b2f5f0cb15500b7b8d5fbebcfe465a0; f4fecb569b79bedea4bc1a5cd96d0bf3efc68e7f; 28f39318c832786f0a887cd1c1d89848e8fe35a9; a326cbfe023c813474c868a1b40a4ef6845231ab,,5,43-48

We hypothesized that BMI would be associated with DNA methylation alterations in cancers. To test this hypothesis, here, we estimated the associations between DNA methylation and BMI through two different methods across 15 cancer types, at approximately 485,000 CpG sites and 2415 samples using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. After comparing the DNA methylation levels in control BMI and high BMI individuals, we found differentially methylated CpG sites (DMSs) in cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) (False Discovery Rate < 0.05). The DMSs of COAD or UCEC were enriched in several obesity-induced and cancer-related pathways. Next, when BMI was used as a continuous variable, we identified BMI-associated methylated CpG sites (BMS) (P (Bonferroni) < 0.05) in CHOL (BMS = 1), COAD (BMS = 1), and UCEC (BMS = 4) using multivariable linear regression. In UCEC, three of the BMSs can predict the clinical outcomes and survival of patients with the tumors. Overall, we observed associations between DNA methylation and high BMI in CHOL, COAD, and UCEC. Furthermore, three BMI-associated CpGs were identified as potential biomarkers for UCEC prognosis.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yinmin Gu"", ids = ""51099219""); list(name = ""Catherine Wei-Hong Zhang"", ids = ""4802227""); list(name = ""Liang Wang"", ids = ""1693997""); list(name = ""Yuhui Zhao"", ids = ""143816873""); list(name = ""Hui Wang"", ids = ""145715646""); list(name = ""Qinong Ye"", ids = ""39985656""); list(name = ""Shan Gao"", ids = ""144665936"")",a15e2b79681c81d1e2a80376758734eda8a11629,8165bdb3e211763bf191b17990fc71cdf331044a; 5137c12387284e1094a2086494a893469db888a9; 47be65ddaa26495cffc3beaf69b2031a6b2ae71b; e9b5e9e856affb3b0366acadd06f34e89a930373; 105bf0feda4c2bfde65d4ed6663046f2b6230f97; 876d3166c21caaebaf907da950ad5684959fc720; 75df0d8a8b6877f3d7750f03b2cb93915cd2bf05; 7c52622501b5563c6aedb23462c6aeef4458a175; c8711e61539c889274dfa295538cd1e8a829b72b; 4df0038893cc9d5953e519d779882cc8f2581af6; 7f77138b4d0d097c5c2e483d578b92c6cc7aa239; fbcb417cf05ee6bd74ed50c68975e6ee82d169d6; 555a2c18265acda5c98dc3c2aed795ac487db029; 7ef2a7ebac6ced77644d0a3e52567964eaa30af5; 520e35ebd6e192e877cf467482c9682f7ac7362c; ee2fa39a5a492a09db62d92e725598308b955a3b; 0c129db0e05bce70f1a406d0cf9cd79d45ea278a; 440d0ee9ee51c825ea7ccb4ea7fd3cdeaf75ae65; f358f4d61d650d77329479bb82160e2c3c15ef1f; aec7faff2c1cdebdc74ac637e990eee7221e3a5f; fe21bc073e8cc58b57abf4ad49ea2042639051e1; 3f70e0caaf961496ac92d83f978ba8627035a2e1; ccac31318d21133c3d42955eb5444e74799250da; dd9005338273bc85b0283d511e04b8bff81a3ae5; c7025e38c5c4ece33007d127bf59984027fd7a4b; cb257805597f7a5e830a0eff397084059e2b6ee3; 1f81fe871e95d97a42a025c8d06c140bf0f65537; fe40860c177b77640c51af82a684a70c1de86d63; e3d2a4fb639f18117b9ed57502170cbca70a3bb2; ac6c452923bbfb1f2ed54c5b03a79e0cdb2dd821; 3b91f667372bbc5295a89f0e576979db6f3ceea4; d63aeaf456fc16a457e5c6dc7f729b9494f9ea67; 74da4352f52c9c503224202b499ef9514fcce22d; 568946e99858ac9651ae0af4925db017472ed7a1; e4ffe829e8dea988a586e947e278575d65eac9f8; 2bbd98012f6aee6dcd6fcdb00375334a33d1bc87; 1a854842f18c5e8ba68f22b3bc24991a380f1c10; 11dbd500a0235b4f77eed4f3d04a7d982b3482f5; 2a324c96e0d8401188b77f35e30a0a11eb33e517; f000d6a2e185442d77eec6a01e47fc3ae05639ad; 5f0c3e19aa5014a6ef13b61166201a347784e530; 97d7041ca3378045c475cf1069ec3e74130f18e9; 220b81a0c5ff8a9fa7e0105fff4429da508fd474; 31eb19d5a4b46883961a42d423a71363022817e1; fd6515f5d7fbb389550831867f7d41e40622c260; 8e4440e6a635cd76a61be6f568ae88e22c2f5763; 3b258ef8cdb2670a7d7b3343523405717dc6be51; 58468d41bbcdf0f915e2ed7a4b9d9be1490faef9; 4df17d36aa41d8001e56ef8b4d5d588fb297f0e7; fcd1b4466df47c84df02d37edeb0ea9c448843c5; ba1f227d7f2cb6c6d722ab31cc2e80ab569ef586; 7ae6a269e6c53bd3986fcd0d23d1ff1bbe11132d; 77556c270d45bd364b6978f030bf4901b35348e2; 6aefb0961489268dc209a6a382670ad4dd0234c1; e66d21b29dff35f618014e54d3cbf5362f11249b; 6efde16a2dae94b7abe0f334817587d89f80531a; 0886baed6aa2f7a42532c519e1707f340c324421; 05f13ed6e3c90c9c28b4086ced4755bdff28a727; 809b369423f99e8d6775f15ea5b307f318863dc4; 2bd2c2ca41a3418c990ce00637e69858c000990b; cf532df8a6277a1be32e60bc298bcfcccf40a3a5; e3a46cf364d2235a4858981f8c538ba49d8b2d21; 32fa4cdfcc82f1dc7c83a037323d2b8852c0b3ea; 19526ea4cd23e067c9263e1d761744b14dd5ed16; 702ffe464a6b19e8f075be40f7b186cbb3fde89a; 4d5eaef243a471e0478d7dbf1b9b170caa3d2c5f; c07c26756a6c1fd087896629ccb04e4ba55ca8b8; 7f36f6314da991702b99ae933a93c2c5470e1f67; 349d8964949477da6bb1a23fa17183cdfd7f46ed; 6d718b70302530ffa1783054ca5de8748ccae75d; 2100b2f4152b2775cfc1361e1c442ab4b27c0efa; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; 1ca88e0c1acb7a51cdf966f7ff7c1381e12cd5f3; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; 32e0267ce83bb139592e93f84f9e414f8980e6ff; d8597c282027b8ef07a3fdc22c2f2ad4644cafae; 1efba0ae2a8c85c4466c08502df5e64bb899c224; 7fdde582980344b9958416e124e1b0903514645f; 4048cca0ca0822798bbccd52a7720df840738313; c6fd9e8c12a765c9a258c8f70c69492157f5e2bf; e6d7787be191e1faed1c021520c78aa937b25014; 53253973ab0154a5cbeef32ab22d3ce4402f46f9,Journal of Cancer,9,2532 - 2542
5208e7f7e8b1b125f93da6092f7303dbd1ee2324,Estimation of empirical null using a mixture of normals and its use in local false discovery rate,"When high dimensional microarray data is given, it is of interest to select significant genes by controlling a given level of Type-I error. One popular way to control the level is the false discovery rate (FDR). This paper considers gene selection based on the local false discovery rate. In most of the previous studies, the null distribution of gene expression is commonly assumed to be a normal distribution. However, if the null distribution has heavier tail than that of normal, there may exist too many false discoveries leading to the failure of controlling the given level of FDR. We propose a novel procedure which enriches a class of null distribution based on a mixture of normals. We present simulation studies to show that our proposed procedure is less sensitive to variation of null distribution than local false discovery rate with a single normal for the null. We also provide real example of gene expression profiles of antigen-specific human CD8+ T-lymphocytes treated with cytokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Interleukin-15 (IL-15) for comparison.",2011,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""DoHwan Park"", ids = ""2313122""); list(name = ""Junyong Park"", ids = ""46979150""); list(name = ""Xiaosong Zhong"", ids = ""48323876""); list(name = ""Michel Sadelain"", ids = ""47758744"")",bfecad1a99a814ebd90111349dc67a852d9e2861,,Comput.

18951e1b90d0bd5b7b9c1dfae6f77355fe1e89cd,"Association of low dietary folate intake with lower CAMKK2 gene methylation, adiposity, and insulin resistance in obese subjects.","Folate deficiency has been putatively implicated in the onset of diverse metabolic abnormalities, including insulin resistance, by altering epigenetic processes on key regulatory genes. The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2) is involved in the regulation of critical metabolic processes such as adiposity and glucose homeostasis. This study hypothesized associations between low folate intakes and lower methylation levels of the CAMKK2 gene, with the presence of metabolic alterations in subjects with obesity. A cross-sectional ancillary study was conducted in obese subjects (n=47) from the RESMENA study (Spain). Fat mass was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Dietary intake and metabolic profile were assessed by validated methods. DNA methylation and gene expression in peripheral white blood cells were analyzed by microarray approaches. A total of 51 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites were associated with folate intake (false discovery rate values < 0.0001), including one located in the 5' untranslated region of the CAMKK2 gene (Illumina ID, cg16942632), which was selected and separately analyzed. Subjects with total folate intake lower than 300Î¼g/d showed more fat mass (especially trunk fat), as well as statistically higher levels of glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, cortisol, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 than those consuming at least or more than 300Î¼g/d. Of note, folate deficiency was related to lower CAMKK2 methylation. Interestingly, CAMKK2 methylation negatively correlated with the HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, CAMKK2 expression directly correlated with HOMA-IR values. In summary, this study suggests associations between low folate intakes, lower CAMKK2 gene methylation, and insulin resistance in obese individuals.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Omar Ramos-Lopez"", ids = ""1413881535""); list(name = ""Mirian Samblas"", ids = ""15717138""); list(name = ""Fermin Ignacio Milagro"", ids = ""3209792""); list(name = ""MarÃ­a Angeles Zulet"", ids = ""14735496""); list(name = ""Maria L Mansego"", ids = ""3599298""); list(name = ""JosÃ©-Ignacio Riezu-Boj"", ids = ""1402206250""); list(name = ""JosÃ© Alfredo MartÃ­nez"", ids = ""47019709"")",a778db742d1a9a6b5f989de31c70f1aa7fc6a2d7; ef0c417994e9a8a210452c8ed2ee9cab4b2fe2c5; 31f36640a839e1b846e28105100e080809b19124; 1cf853fb9f324af9b376d4da11fc422e082ced19; df0cbf1ad2e3eb91094fec4bc45f3ca6a0bbe8bc,,Nutrition research,50,"

86f3ef7a608dbd241e3db4db7c29e6274205423a,Clinical Utility and Practical Considerations of a Coronary Artery Disease Genetic Risk Score,"Background
Coronary artery disease (CAD) risk traditionally has been assessed using clinical risk factors. We evaluated whether molecular genetic markers for CAD risk could add information to traditional variables.


Methods
We developed a false discovery rate 267-marker genetic risk score (FDR267) from markers that were significantly associated with CAD in the UK Biobank cohort meta-analysis. FDR267 was tested in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analyses in the European and African American groups.


Results
Our genetic risk score (FDR267) was associated with a 1.45 (95% confidence interval, 1.39-1.51) increase in odds ratio and a 1.32 (95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.38) increase in hazard ratio per standard deviation of the score. The score modestly improved the area under the curve (AUC) statistic when added to a clinical model (Î”AUCÂ = 0.0112, PÂ = 0.0002). FDR267 predicted incident CAD (C-indexÂ = 0.60), although it did not improve on clinical risk factors (Î”AUCÂ = 0.0159, PÂ = 0.0965). Individuals in the top quintile of FDR267 genetic risk were at approximately 2-fold increased risk compared with the bottom quintile, which is comparable to risk associated with self-reported family history. The performance of FDR267 was less robust in the African American sample.


Conclusions
FDR267 is significantly associated with CAD in the European sample, with an effect size comparable to self-reported family history. FDR267 discriminated between individuals with and without CAD, but did not improve CAD risk prediction over clinical variables. FDR267 was less predictive of CAD risk in African Americans.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Robin Liu"", ids = ""50268308""); list(name = ""Jiahui Cheng"", ids = ""10775162""); list(name = ""Carlos Muzlera"", ids = ""89852028""); list(name = ""J.

They share similar symptoms but differ in the location and extent of inflammation and in complications. We identified 249 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CD and 38 in UC at a false discovery rate of 1%. 20 of the DEGs were common to both diseases. A multivariate test identified 260 DEGs associated with IBD, 53 of which were not found in any of the disorders. We identified important molecular pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD, such as the JAK/STAT and interferon-gamma signaling pathways, genes involved in cell adhesion, apoptosis and carcinogenesis. Among others, BCAT1 and GZMB are interesting novel DEGs that deserve further investigation in experimental models.

Cerebral embolic events represent recognized side effects after catheter ablation in the treatment of recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF).


OBJECTIVE
The study was performed to analyze the neuropsychological outcome and to detect new embolic ischemic brain lesions after therapeutic left atrial catheter ablation of AF.


METHODS
We enrolled 23 patients with recurrent AF who underwent elective circumferential pulmonary vein isolation. The primary endpoint was the neuropsychological outcome 3 months after intervention in contrast to the results of non-AF controls (n = 23) without ablation and in covariance of baseline performance. Cerebral diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) was performed in 21 AF patients at baseline, 2-4 days, and 3 months after intervention.


RESULTS
In 3/21 patients (14.3%), new ischemic lesions were detected on DWI shortly after intervention. In one patient, a territorial middle cerebral artery infarct occurred with severe clinical symptoms. The other two patients represented clinically silent small lesions. In contrast to the control group and in covariance of baseline performance, the ablation group showed worse neuropsychological outcome in verbal memory (one of five cognitive domains) with an effect size of d = 0.93[t (.05; 42) = -3.53; P < .001; false discovery rate (FDR)(crit) â‰¤ .01].


CONCLUSION
Adverse neuropsychological changes after left atrial catheter ablation are verifiable in verbal memory and, conjoined with ischemic brain lesions on DWI, might represent cerebral side effects of this procedure.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Niko P Schwarz"", ids = ""49519347""); list(name = ""Malte Kuniss"", ids = ""5723042""); list(name = ""Max Nedelmann"", ids = ""3585639""); list(name = ""Manfred Kaps"", ids = ""3146956""); list(name = ""Georg Bachmann"", ids = ""114477039""); list(name = ""Thomas Neumann"", ids = ""39388188""); list(name = ""Heinz-Friedrich Pitschner"", ids = ""34619357""); list(name = ""Tibo Gerriets"", ids = ""2598963"")",38788bc34a7ae134d9eea81a6cd9782a66503b50; 86a61ba3cd65f598e5c456ce1b33cf54801bf5bb; 66e94ebd99935d216c7e2e6087fc1f60e5e896af; 58231ea811126b980d451d08e442461e0f1b82c1; 1980900e61abce4e501a71bdd065ef27b50c9769; c9f5f3f15b20f4480e6c2f902ffc667dd0af9a5e; fd46e7e0ff137f202c896871e91b2b05e6d4a14c; 65aa74cb67e61fa0c924242d45c321d895705e42; e7bbca496eb1390995a4617c745a3a359cbae142; 093be6eabd5b64f78e3282f27f74a98a4e419503; 28f01cb556714a9c48f73b18369792c28a29314b; c6b15ff57c572c485b2caf1f2e738c3b6f64362f; 23e83e0e4181e36fb566f65c311fd16e2fa90e03; 3d77dd69807a8df9cceacf25ba812d5e56450a79; 6523c56d2ae05ccb325faa8bf21b71836ec2a7aa,c02999520b1a5966aeef3359bcd43a09b0ada740; ef1e48e4e2fe46605237c401dd391f4bb3b6294e; ce4d65abe34323f8c0fe36f62641ee85616cb669; e6e7897f2f306425530b0e0fc976db0b275b5c82; 9b3b999597c85d75229e0f82b53086f41ff96214; 31c855858e0d0b9c45f2afa5107cd305441e530d; dc5e6f85ab83641283e99fcf6a8ce57aec3f7434; 2d26313fa32084975eea31ac978270b88403ca8f; 1580dc095c45fb4451a3c93ab9214b49c008c3a4,Heart rhythm,7 12,"

88241b390f81d84900aa0215447622304b43c579,Biostatistical aspects of genome-wide association studies.,"To search the entire human genome for association is a novel and promising approach to unravelling the genetic basis of complex genetic diseases. In these genome-wide association studies (GWAs), several hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are analyzed at the same time, posing substantial biostatistical and computational challenges. In this paper, we discuss a number of biostatistical aspects of GWAs in detail. We specifically consider quality control issues and show that signal intensity plots are a sine qua condition non in today's GWAs. Approaches to detect and adjust for population stratification are briefly examined. We discuss different strategies aimed at tackling the problem of multiple testing, including adjustment of p -values, the false positive report probability and the false discovery rate. Another aspect of GWAs requiring special attention is the search for gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. We finally describe multistage approaches to GWAs.",2008,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Andreas Ziegler"", ids = ""144071896""); list(name = ""Inke R.

4361199064a38dfc29611977a416ed9465d6e202,Effects of hormone therapy on brain morphology of healthy postmenopausal women: a Voxel-based morphometry study,"Objective: Estrogens are known to be protective in age-associated cognitive changes in humans and in neurodegeneration in animal models. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of estrogen therapy (ET) on human gray matter volume in vivo. Design: Forty healthy postmenopausal women underwent three-dimensional high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging: 17 were never treated, 16 were currently receiving ET, and 7 had had ET in the past. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) with SPM2 was used, according to an optimized protocol, to compare women under past and current ET to those never treated. Significance threshold was set at P = 0.01, corrected by false discovery rate. Results: Voxel-based morphometry indicated that estrogen use was associated with greater gray matter volumes in the whole group of treated women, which included the cerebellum (cluster size, Z coordinates: 5,527; 5.15; âˆ’14 âˆ’54 âˆ’10), the amygdaloid-hippocampal complex (left: 19; 3.55; âˆ’22 âˆ’4 âˆ’18; right: 45; 3.61; 16 âˆ’6 âˆ’16), and extended to the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital neocortex. The comparison current ET versus past ET use showed that women who underwent treatment in the past had greater volumes of gray matter compared to women under current treatment. Conclusions: ET might slow down age-related gray matter loss in postmenopausal women. The structures that exhibited greater volume in association with ET included the cerebellar and cerebral cortices and, typically involved in Alzheimer's disease, the medial temporal structures and the temporoparietal junction.",2006,Medicine,"list(name = ""Marina Boccardi"", ids = ""3122784""); list(name = ""Roberta Ghidoni"", ids = ""3875374""); list(name = ""Stefano M.

26ac0a60a2c790dc642fa1bf97854c762d03fcd0,Associating complex traits with rare variants identified by NGS: improving power by a position-dependent kernel approach,"Current high-throughput sequencing technologies have allowed for an easy and cost-efficient identification of rare single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), many of which have already been proven to be associated with diseases or complex traits. Despite these successes, genomewide association studies involving rare variants remain statistically challenging. Classical single-SNV association studies particularly suffer from poor statistical power, as the potentially large number of SNVs often leads to poor significance upon false discovery rate (FDR) correction. To overcome these difficulties, approaches have been proposed that do not consider all SNVs individually; instead, they group SNVs and perform tests on those groups. This can either be done by grouping SNVs that are in the same genomic region of interest (e.g. the same transcript or exon) or by windowing along each chromosome. The choice of the groups/windows is crucial: FDR correction does not pose a serious problem if there are large, and consequently fewer, windows, but the local tests have poor power for large windows. If smaller windows, and consequently a larger number thereof, are chosen, the local tests perform well, but FDR correction nullifies this advantage.",2012,,"list(name = ""Ulrich Bodenhofer"", ids = ""3347338""); list(name = ""Sepp Hochreiter"", ids = ""48181745"")",035f80857635f715ad919ab6b3778cd49c027377,,,,
adefeef373ae92255051978c2b8f3f8fb7649286,110 Temporal Changes in Endometrial Gene Expression Between Ipsi- and Contralateral Uterine Horns in Cattle,"The transfer of an embryo into the uterine horn contralateral to the ovary bearing the corpus luteum has been associated with a decreased pregnancy rate in cattle compared with transfer into the ipsilateral horn. These findings suggest that the environment in the contralateral horn is less conducive to supporting conceptus development than that of the ipsilateral horn. Therefore, this study compared the endometrial transcriptome of the ipsi- and contralateral uterine horns during the luteal phase. Endometrial samples from the ipsi- (IPSI) and contralateral (CONTRA) horns were collected from synchronized nonpregnant beef heifers on Days 5, 7, 13 or 16 post-oestrus (nâ€‰=â€‰5 heifers per time point). Total RNA was isolated and sequenced. Differences in the transcriptome were determined by edgeR-robust analysis. Principal component analysis found that IPSI and CONTRA have distinct patterns of gene expression on each day, with Day 5 exhibiting the most variation and Day 16 being least variable. Further, the 2 uterine horns had distinct expression patterns on Day 5, with IPSI exhibiting significantly higher variation in gene expression compared twitho CONTRA. EdgeR-robust analysis found 217 (201 up- and 16 down-regulated), 54 (44 up- and 10 down-regulated), 14 (13 up- and 1 down-regulated), and 18 (14 up- and 4 down-regulated) differentially expressed genes (DEG; >2-fold change, false discovery rate Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) between IPSI and CONTRA endometria on Days 5, 7, 13, and 16 of the oestrous cycle, respectively. The top 5 canonical pathways associated with DEG between IPSI and CONTRA during the luteal phase of the oestrous cycle were involved in signalling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells (73/138), progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation (55/89), endometrial cancer (31/51), ErbB signalling pathway (50/87), and mTOR signalling pathway (36/61). The impact of DEG on signalling pathways was assessed using a pathway perturbation algorithm called Signalling Pathway Impact Analysis (SPIA). This topology-based pathway analysis was conducted using the Bioconductor ToPAseq package (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ToPASeq.html) and revealed that signalling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells showed the highest perturbation score when IPSI was compared with CONTRA irrespective of day. Discovering and cataloguing which pathways are perturbed in each uterine horn throughout the oestrous cycle may contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying early embryonic loss. Ths study was supported by Science Foundation Ireland (13/IA/1983) and the Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and The Marine (13S528).",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""JosÃ© MarÃ­a SÃ¡nchez"", ids = ""77510315""); list(name = ""Claudia Passaro"", ids = ""48542484""); list(name = ""Niamh Forde"", ids = ""52140919""); list(name = ""Susanta K Behura"", ids = ""3828128""); list(name = ""John A.

The genes were selected among those previously studied in Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), the variability of which indicates the influence of selection or shows the association with phenotypic traits that are important for adaptation to low temperatures and to geographically heterogeneous environment. Nucleotide sequences of eight genes, including coding and noncoding regions, were amplified and sequenced using newly developed primers specific to Larix. The sample size was 123 megagametophytes per locus in L. sibirica and 16.2 in L. occidentalis, which was taken as the out-group. The length of the sequenced fragments was 246-1700 bp. Nucleotide polymorphism Ï€ averaged 0.00536 (0.002 - 0.008), and haplotype diversity was H(d): 0.822 (0.625-0.948). Tajima's D was negative in all fragments and significant in three, while statistics D* and F* was significant in three and four segments, respectively, and F(s) was significant in three. This may indicate the presence of purifying selection on these genes or population growth. The HKA test revealed no significant deviations from the neutral model of evolution in all genes. The recombination parameter Ï/Î¸ = 0.28 was close to the value obtained from P. menziesii. To investigate the association of polymorphic sites (factor) in these eight genes to the latitude of investigated individuals (trait), the generalized linear model (GLM) was used taking into account the population structure. After the False Discovery Rate correction no significant associations were found. The age of the split of American and Eurasian Larix lineages based on the nucleotide differences in the eight genes between L. sibirica and L. occidentalis is estimated to be 12 million years, which is much younger than the age of the most ancient Larix discoveries.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""V.

As an application of the STEM algorithm for peak detection developed in Schwartzman et al. (2011) and Cheng & Schwartzman (2014), the method detects change points as significant local maxima and minima after smoothing and di fferentiating the observed sequence. The algorithm, combined with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for thresholding pvalues, provides asymptotic strong control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and power consistency, as the length of the sequence and the size of the jumps get large. Simulations show that FDR levels are maintained in non-asymptotic conditions and guide the choice of smoothing bandwidth with respect to the desired location tolerance.

It has been proven that ensemble learning can significantly improve selection accuracy, alleviate the instability of traditional selection methods, and reduce false discovery rate (FDR). Therefore, variable selection ensembles (VSEs) have gained much interest in recent years. Stability selection [1], a VSE technique based on subsampling in combination with a base algorithm like lasso, is an effective method to control FDR and to improve selection accuracy in linear regression models. In this paper, we apply it to handle variable selection problems in a Cox model. Some simulated data with various censoring rates are used to study the influence of one parameter Amin in stability selection to its performance. In the meantime, stability selection is compared with other variable selection approaches.

A noninvasive diagnostic method to predict the degree of malignancy accurately would be of great help in glioma management. This study aimed to create a highly accurate machine learning model to perform glioma grading.


METHODS
Preoperative MRI acquired for cases of glioma operated on at our institution from October 2014 through January 2018 were obtained retrospectively. Six types of MRI sequences (T2-weighted image, diffusion-weighted image, apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], fractional anisotropy, and mean kurtosis [MK]) were chosen for analysis; 476 features were extracted semi-automatically for each sequence (2,856 features in total). Recursive feature elimination was used to select significant features for a machine learning model that distinguishes glioblastoma from lower-grade glioma (grades II/III).


RESULTS
Fifty-five datasets from 54 cases were obtained (14 grade II gliomas, 12 grade III gliomas, and 29 glioblastomas), of which 44 and 11 datasets were used for machine learning and independent testing, respectively. We detected 504 features with significant differences (false discovery rate < 0.05) between glioblastoma and lower-grade glioma. The most accurate machine learning model was created using 6 features extracted from the ADC and MK images. In the logistic regression, the area under the curve was 0.90 Â± 0.05 and the accuracy of the test dataset was 0.91 (10/11); using a support vector machine, they were 0.93 Â± 0.03 and 0.91 (10/11), respectively (kernel, radial basis function; c, 1.0).


CONCLUSIONS
Our machine learning model accurately predicted glioma tumor grade. The ADC and MK sequences produced particularly useful features.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Satoshi Takahashi"", ids = ""145566889""); list(name = ""Wataru Takahashi"", ids = ""2590195""); list(name = ""Shota Tanaka"", ids = ""145267271""); list(name = ""Akihiro Haga"", ids = ""2193050""); list(name = ""T.

We then assessed the degree of over-representation of doxorubicin pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic genes in the dataset of doxorubicin resistance genes.ResultsOf 27,958 Entrez genes on the array, 7.4 per cent or 2,063 genes were differentially expressed byâ€‰â‰¥â€‰2-fold between wildtype and doxorubicin-resistant cells. The false discovery rate was set at 0.01 and the minimum p value for significance for any gene within the â€œhit listâ€ was 0.01. Seventeen and 43 per cent of doxorubicin pharmacokinetic genes were over-represented in the hit list, depending upon whether the gene name was identical or within the same gene family, respectively. The most over-represented genes were within the 1C and 1B families of aldo-keto reductases (AKRs), which convert doxorubicin to doxorubicinol. Other genes convert doxorubicin to other metabolites or affect the influx, efflux, or cytotoxicity of the drug. In further support of the role of AKRs in doxorubicin resistance, we observed that, in comparison to doxorubicin, doxorubincol exhibited dramatically reduced cytotoxicity, reduced DNA-binding activity, and strong localization to extra nuclear lysosomes. Pharmacologic inhibition of the above AKRs in doxorubicin-resistant cells increased cellular doxorubicin levels, restored doxorubicin cytotoxicity and re-established doxorubicin localization to the nucleus. The properties of doxorubicinol were unaffected.ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate the utility of using curated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic knowledge bases to identify highly relevant genes associated with doxorubicin resistance. The induction of one or more of these genes was found to be correlated with changes in the drugâ€™s properties, while inhibiting one specific class of these genes (the AKRs) increased cellular doxorubicin content and restored drug DNA binding, cytotoxicity, and subcellular localization.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Allan D Heibein"", ids = ""5808272""); list(name = ""Baoqing Guo"", ids = ""8039201""); list(name = ""Jason A.

edabde944211dc111f1f2f10866b7de99093b7e7,A Large Scale Gene-Centric Association Study of Lung Function in Newly-Hired Female Cotton Textile Workers with Endotoxin Exposure,"BACKGROUND
Occupational exposure to endotoxin is associated with decrements in pulmonary function, but how much variation in this association is explained by genetic variants is not well understood.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with the rate of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) decline by a large scale genetic association study in newly-hired healthy young female cotton textile workers.


METHODS
DNA samples were genotyped using the Illumina Human CVD BeadChip. Change rate in FEV1 was modeled as a function of each SNP genotype in linear regression model with covariate adjustment. We controlled the type 1 error in study-wide level by permutation method. The false discovery rate (FDR) and the family-wise error rate (FWER) were set to be 0.10 and 0.15 respectively.


RESULTS
Two SNPs were found to be significant (P<6.29Ã—10(-5)), including rs1910047 (Pâ€Š=â€Š3.07Ã—10(-5), FDRâ€Š=â€Š0.0778) and rs9469089 (Pâ€Š=â€Š6.19Ã—10(-5), FDRâ€Š=â€Š0.0967), as well as other eight suggestive (P<5Ã—10(-4)) associated SNPs. Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions were also observed, such as rs1910047 and rs1049970 (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.0418, FDRâ€Š=â€Š0.0895); rs9469089 and age (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.0161, FDRâ€Š=â€Š0.0264). Genetic risk score analysis showed that the more risk loci the subjects carried, the larger the rate of FEV1 decline occurred (P trendâ€Š=â€Š3.01Ã—10(-18)). However, the association was different among age subgroups (Pâ€Š=â€Š7.11Ã—10(-6)) and endotoxin subgroups (Pâ€Š=â€Š1.08Ã—10(-2)). Functional network analysis illustrates potential biological connections of all interacted genes.


CONCLUSIONS
Genetic variants together with environmental factors interact to affect the rate of FEV1 decline in cotton textile workers.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ruyang Zhang"", ids = ""7265522""); list(name = ""Yang Zhao"", ids = ""46317279""); list(name = ""Minjie Chu"", ids = ""1994775""); list(name = ""Amar Mehta"", ids = ""144332959""); list(name = ""Yongyue Wei"", ids = ""145388770""); list(name = ""Yao Liu"", ids = ""1778865""); list(name = ""Peng Cheng Xun"", ids = ""144088632""); list(name = ""Jianling Bai"", ids = ""50257733""); list(name = ""Hao Yu"", ids = ""49514544""); list(name = ""Li Su"", ids = ""145235477""); list(name = ""Hongxi Zhang"", ids = ""49723421""); list(name = ""Zhibin Hu"", ids = ""143882410""); list(name = ""Hongbing Shen"", ids = ""144355454""); list(name = ""Feng Chen"", ids = ""47591235""); list(name = ""David C.

419ef0b8ab5c2d4f3522b77de25470372d3413c7,Pre- and post-partum mild underfeeding influences gene expression in the reproductive tract of cyclic dairy cows.,"Undernutrition before and after calving has a detrimental effect on the fertility of dairy cows. The effect of nutritional stress was previously reported to influence gene expression in key tissues for metabolic health and reproduction such as the liver and the genital tract early after calving, but not at breeding, that is, between 70 and 90Â days post-partum. This study investigated the effects of pre- and post-partum mild underfeeding on global gene expression in the oviduct, endometrium and corpus luteum of eight multiparous Holstein cows during the early and middle phases of an induced cycle 80Â days post-partum. Four control cows received 100% of energy and protein requirements during the dry period and after calving, while four underfed received 80% of control diet. Oestrous synchronization treatment was used to induce ovulation on D80 post-partum. Oviducts, ovaries and the anterior part of each uterine horn were recovered surgically 4, 8, 12 and 15Â days after ovulation. Corpora lutea were dissected from the ovaries, and the endometrium was separated from the stroma and myometrium in each uterine horn. The oviduct segments were comprised of ampulla and isthmus. RNAs from ipsi- and contralateral samples were pooled on an equal weight basis. In each tissue, gene expression was assessed on a custom bovine 10K array. No differentially expressed gene (DEG) in the corpus luteum was identified between underfed and control, conversely to 293 DEGs in the oviduct vs 1 in the endometrium under a false discovery rate (FDR) <Â 0.10 and 1370 DEGs vs 3, respectively, under FDRÂ <Â 0.15. Additionally, we used dedicated statistics (regularized canonical correlation analysis) to correlate the post-partum patterns of six plasma metabolites and hormones related to energy metabolism measured weekly between calving and D80 with gene expression. High correlations were observed between post-partum patterns of IGF-1, insulin, Î²-hydroxybutyrate and the expression in the oviduct of genes related to reproductive system disease, connective tissue disorders and metabolic disease. Moreover, we found special interest in the literature to retinoic acid-related genes (e.g. FABP5/CRABP2) that might indicate abnormalities in post-partum tissue repair mechanisms. In conclusion, this experiment highlights relationships between underfeeding and gene expression in the oviduct and endometrium after ovulation in cyclic Holstein cows. This might help to explain the effect of mild undernutrition on fertilization failure and early embryonic mortality in post-partum dairy cows.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Damien Valour"", ids = ""15277739""); list(name = ""Isabelle Hue"", ids = ""3117831""); list(name = ""SÃ©verine A.

53a4df4d2591bfee571ecb65ed011dc772379e9d,On correlated z-values distribution in hypothesis testing,"Multiple-testing problems have received much attention. Different strategies have been considered in order to deal with this problem. The false discovery rate (FDR) is, probably, the most studied criterion. On the other hand, the sequential goodness of fit (SGoF), is a recently proposed approach. Most of the developed procedures are based on the independence among the involved tests; however, in spite of being a reasonable proviso in some frameworks, independence is not realistic for a number of practical cases. Therefore, one of the main problems in order to develop appropriate methods is, precisely, the effect of the dependence among the different tests on decisions making. The consequences of the correlation on the z-values distribution in the general multitesting problem are explored. Some different algorithms are provided in order to approximate the distribution of the expected rejection proportions. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated in a simulation study in which, for comparison purposes, the Benjamini and Hochberg method to control the FDR, the Lehmann and Romano procedure to control the tail probability of the proportion of false positives (TPPFP), and the Beta-Binomial SGoF procedure are considered. Three different dependence structures are considered. As usual, for a better understanding of the problem, several practical cases are also studied.",2014,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Pablo MartÃ­nez-Camblor"", ids = ""66627552"")",ffa6b831bb458b0064dd8026b27ccbf607dcdc71; a0d32e76e1b394f985c139132edc4aaddf9f8dbf; 7809664799f01b300241ac9239057a883e81670d; a34668a36fce9e7f5007a609ae0aa98bf7c5aad6; 1cfbfc10d659ab2207c8c9ce7e0608fd1472a920,,Comput.

The disease is characterized by an altered homeostasis of the humoral immune response and the production of allo-/autoantibodies. Changes in glycosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG), the main effector molecule of the humoral immune system, are associated with a number of autoimmune and hematological diseases. Patients and Methods Plasma samples and clinical data were collected from patients enrolled in a cross-sectional natural history cGVHD study at the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, USA (NCT00092235) from 2004 to 2014. cGVHD was diagnosed according to the NIH Consensus criteria. IgG was isolated, deglycosylated and analyzed by hydrophilic interaction chromatographyâ€“ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Glycan chromatographic peaks (24) were directly measured and additional derived traits (57), representing composite traits such as total galactosylation, were calculated. Associations were tested using Wilcoxon test. Upon correction for multiple testing via false discovery rate results with p-values below 0.05 were considered significant. Results IgG glycome composition was analyzed in 242 cGVHD patients (43% female; median age 45 years [range 5-71]). A majority had received myeloablative conditioning (56%), had unrelated donors (58%), peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (79%), and history of acute GVHD (67%). cGVHD was characterized as de novo in 33%, progressive in 37% and quiescent in 30%, and classified as classic in 85%. Most of the patients had severe (75%) or moderate (23%) global NIH cGVHD score. cGVHD was considered to be active by clinical assessment at the time of evaluation in 50% of patients. Intensity of immunosuppression was classified as none in 19%, mild (prednisone alone <0.5 mg/kg/day) in 8%, moderate (prednisone alone â‰¥0.5 mg/kg/day, and/or any other single agent or modality) in 34%, and high (two or more agents or modalities (Â±prednisone â‰¥0.5 mg/kg/day) in 39% of patients (Bone Marrow Transplant. 2010;45:762-9.). In this preliminary analysis results revealed a significant association of IgG glycan structures with different intensities of immunosuppression: none vs moderate: GP1 (p=0.002) and GP3 (p=0.027); and none vs high: GP1 (p=0.002), GP3 (p=0.006), GP18 (p=0.018), GP23 (p=0.004), G2 (p=0.044), IGP26 (p=0.027), IGP57 (p=0.037) and IGP69 (p=0.037). Comparisons none vs mild immunosuppression did not show significant associations with glycans. Elevated levels of agalactosylated structures (GP1 and GP3) and those with bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GP3, IGP69) with pro-inflammatory functions were associated with increased level of immunosuppression. Sialylated (GP18, GP23, IGP26) and galactosylated (G2, IGP57) IgG glycan structures with anti-inflammatory properties (Ann NY Acad Sci.2012;1253:170-80.) showed the opposite trend; their levels reduce with increased",2017,,"list(name = ""John Levine"", ids = ""46309851""); list(name = ""Umut Ozbek"", ids = ""5804733""); list(name = ""Anne S.

230157ffe73ea2d1ce1ee608682d07c5999829dc,Abstract 3643: Fetal exposure to diethylstilbestrol and DNA methylation in adult women.,"In utero diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure has long term consequences including increased risk of vaginal and breast cancer. Epigenetic factors are suspected to contribute to some of these increased risks and animal studies show DES-mediated effects on DNA methylation in both uterine tissue and blood. However, there are currently no studies examining the effect of fetal DES exposure on DNA methylation in humans. Therefore, we investigated differences in DNA methylation between women exposed to DES in utero compared to unexposed women. All our study subjects were participants in the Sister Study -a prospective cohort focused on environmental and familial risk factors for breast cancer and other diseases. Within this study 1,156 women (2.3%) said that they were definitely or probably exposed to DES in utero. In a special sub study (including both women who reported positive exposure and women who reported no exposure), we confirmed exposure history with the woman9s mother and from those with matching mother daughter reports we randomly selected 100 exposed and 100 unexposed women. We analyzed DNA methylation patterns in blood using the Illumina 450k array to assess methylation at 473,844 CpG sites. Primary analysis did not reveal any differentially methylated CpGs (dmCpGs) below the false discovery rate (FDR, q Citation Format: S Sophia Harlid, Zongli Xu, Vijayalakshmi Panduri, Aimee D9Aloisio, Lisa DeRoo, Dale Sandler, Jack A.

9621d4e9d91e4327c7541164800f36ad8b79366b,Association of gene variants with incident myocardial infarction in the Cardiovascular Health Study.,"OBJECTIVE
We asked whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that had been nominally associated with cardiovascular disease in antecedent studies were also associated with cardiovascular disease in a population-based prospective study of 4522 individuals aged 65 or older.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Based on antecedent studies, we prespecified a risk allele and an inheritance model for each of 74 SNPs. We then tested the association of these SNPs with myocardial infarction (MI) in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). The prespecified risk alleles of 8 SNPs were nominally associated (1-sided P<0.05) with increased risk of MI in White CHS participants. The false discovery rate for these 8 was 0.43, suggesting that about 4 of these 8 are likely to be true positives. The 4 of these 8 SNPs that had the strongest evidence for association with cardiovascular disease before testing in CHS (association in 3 antecedent studies) were in KIF6 (CHS HR=1.29; 90%CI 1.1 to 1.52), VAMP8 (HR=1.2; 90%CI 1.02 to 1.41), TAS2R50 (HR=1.13; 90%CI 1 to 1.27), and LPA (HR=1.62; 90%CI 1.09 to 2.42).


CONCLUSIONS
Although most of the SNPs investigated were not associated with MI in CHS, evidence from this investigation combined with previous studies suggests that 4 of these SNPs are likely associated with MI.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dov Shiffman"", ids = ""35434922""); list(name = ""Ellen S.

f02dc13f10df6def876e8949bcdbc26bd2a64108,Genetic variation in vitamin D-related genes and risk of breast cancer among women of European and East Asian descent,"Studies of vitamin D-related genetic variants and breast cancer have been inconsistent. This study aimed to investigate associations of vitamin D-related polymorphisms and breast cancer risk among European and East Asian women and potential interactions with menopausal status and breast tumour subtypes. Data from a caseâ€“control study of breast cancer (1037 cases and 1050 controls) were used to assess relationships between 21 polymorphisms in two vitamin D-related genes (GC and VDR) and breast cancer risk. Odds ratios were calculated in stratified analyses of European and East Asian women, using logistic regression in an additive genetic model. An interaction term was used to explore modification by menopausal status. Polytomous regression was used to assess heterogeneity by breast tumour subtype. False discovery rate adjustments were conducted to account for multiple testing. No association was observed between GC or VDR polymorphisms and breast cancer risk. Modification of these relationships by menopausal status was observed for select polymorphisms in both Europeans (VDR rs4328262 and rs11168292) and East Asians (GC rs7041 and VDR rs11168287). Heterogeneity by tumour subtype was seen for three VDR polymorphisms (rs1544410, rs7967152 and rs2239186) among Europeans, in which associations with ERâˆ’/PRâˆ’/HER2+ tumours, but not with other subtypes, were observed. In conclusion, associations between vitamin D-related genetic variants and breast cancer were not observed overall, although the relationships between vitamin D pathway polymorphisms and breast cancer may be modified by menopausal status and breast tumour subtype.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Joy Shi"", ids = ""46865391""); list(name = ""Anne Grundy"", ids = ""4380036""); list(name = ""Harriet Richardson"", ids = ""145722094""); list(name = ""Igor Burstyn"", ids = ""2845872""); list(name = ""Johanna M.

5f96ece286124c01889718e3fb58d70faa044138,Effects of heavy in utero cocaine exposure on adolescent caudate morphology.,"We assess the effects of in utero cocaine and polysubstance exposure on the adolescent caudate nucleus through high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Cocaine exposure may compromise the developing brain through disruption of neural ontogeny in dopaminergic systems, effects secondary to fetal hypoxemia, or altered cerebrovascular reactivity. Cocaine exposure may also lead to neonatal lesions in the caudate. However, long-term or latent effects of intrauterine cocaine exposure are rarely found. We use T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to quantify caudate nucleus morphology in matched control and exposed groups. The literature suggests that in utero cocaine exposure consequences in adolescents may be subtle, or masked by other variables. Our comparison focuses on contrasting the control group with high-exposure subjects (mothers who reported 2 median of 117 days of cocaine use during pregnancy; 82% tested positive for cocaine use at term). We use advanced image registration and segmentation tools to quantify left and right caudate morphology. Our results indicate that the caudate is significantly larger in controls versus subjects (P < 0.0025), implying cocaine exposure-related detriments to the dopaminergic system. The right (P < 0.025) and left (P < 0.035) caudate, studied independently, show the same significant trend.

b50a77faf11a95b6e9d4c10332665957b9379904,Serum proteomics and biomarker discovery across the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.,"UNLABELLED
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), ranging from relatively benign simple steatosis to progressive nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis, is an increasingly common chronic liver disease. Liver biopsy is currently the only reliable tool for staging the subtypes of NAFLD; therefore, noninvasive serum biomarkers for evaluation of liver disease and fibrosis are urgently needed. We performed this study to describe changes in the serum proteome and identify biomarker candidates in serum samples from 69 patients with varying stages of NAFLD (simple steatosis, NASH, and NASH with advanced bridging [F3/F4] fibrosis) and 16 obese controls. Using a label-free mass spectrometry-based approach we identified over 1,700 serum proteins with a peptide identification (ID) confidence level of >75%, 605 of which changed significantly between any two patient groups (false discovery rate <5%). Importantly, expression levels of 55 and 15 proteins changed significantly between the simple steatosis and NASH F3/F4 group and the NASH and NASH F3/F4 group, respectively. Classification of proteins with significant changes showed involvement in immune system regulation and inflammation, coagulation, cellular and extracellular matrix structure and function, and roles as carrier proteins in the blood. Further, many of these proteins are synthesized exclusively by the liver and could potentially serve as diagnostic biomarkers for identifying and staging NAFLD.


CONCLUSION
This proteomic analysis reveals important information regarding the pathogenesis/progression of NAFLD and NASH and demonstrates key changes in serum protein expression levels between control subjects and patients with different stages of fatty liver.

fde1af752a6c63317be36c5618d4f55f7078266f,Pooling information across different studies and oligonucleotide chip types to identify prognostic genes for lung cancer,"Our goal in this work was to pool information across microarray studies conducted at different institutions using two different versions of Affymetrix chips to identify genes whose expression levels offer information on lung cancer patientsâ€™ survival above and beyond the information provided by readily available clinical covariates. We combined information across chip types by identifying â€œmatching probesâ€ present on both chips, and then assembling them into new probesets based on Unigene clusters. This method yielded comparable expression level quantifications across chips without sacrificing much precision or significantly altering the relative ordering of the samples. We fit a series of multivariable Cox models containing clinical covariates and genes and identified 26 genes that provided information on survival after adjusting for the clinical covariates, while controlling the false discovery rate at 0.20 using the Beta-Uniform mixture method. Many of these genes appeared to be biologically interesting and worthy of future investigation. Only one gene in our list has been mentioned in previously published analyses of these data. It appears that the increased statistical power provided by the pooling was key in finding these new genes, since only nine out of the 26 genes were detected when we apply these methods to the two data sets separately, i.e., without pooling.",2005,Biology,"list(name = ""Jeffrey S.

20edf6ef1cdc249be0b8a5e24a4ec6d4078501e8,Genetic variants in protein kinase C zeta gene and type 2 diabetes risk: a case-control study of a Chinese Han population.,"BACKGROUND
Previous investigations of the protein kinase C zeta (PRKCZ) gene, a susceptibility factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), have focussed on its single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In a departure from these earlier studies, we tested six tagging markers of PRKCZ based on the Hapmap database to evaluate their association with T2DM.


METHODS
PCR-RFLP was performed to test the genotypes in type 2 diabetes patients (n = 343) and normal controls (n = 429). Insulin-related indexes were calculated from levels of fasting plasma insulin (FPI) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG).


RESULTS
The variant genotypes, rs3753242TT, rs2503706CT, rs2503706CT/ TT and rs262654TT were associated with T2DM. And the significance remained for rs3753242 TT (p < 0.001) after the false discovery rate (FDR) correction. There was a doubling in the prevalence of the TTGCCC haplotype in the case subjects (14.2%) compared with the control subjects (6.9%) [OR (95% CI) = 2.19(1.49-3.22)]. In the control group, none of the haplotypes studied was associated with insulin-related indexes.


CONCLUSIONS
The PRKCZ gene variants associated with the development of T2DM in this study must be investigated in a larger population to reveal any potential effects on metabolism.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lei Qin"", ids = ""143762180""); list(name = ""Ling Zhou"", ids = ""46696667""); list(name = ""Xueji Wu"", ids = ""47149787""); list(name = ""Jinluo Cheng"", ids = ""6619645""); list(name = ""Jingsong Wang"", ids = ""1800216""); list(name = ""Yunfeng Du"", ids = ""49963505""); list(name = ""Jihong Hu"", ids = ""7011933""); list(name = ""Moyu Shen"", ids = ""12892256""); list(name = ""Jinyi Zhou"", ids = ""49640411"")",a9002ce329e08f7123f4dec4a113ae3b9a347754; 4f113d9834626ef367e80dfeb2bc36ec73f18758; b979e30cad5d61adb0c851dd5db2e8d5e9e4ed7f; 93aeef23c1679eb0b34a289bb97c785a6f44c424,a3462dbe91cf84370fc806e04f19fd0c765865d7; a6eb8a4da301972c51aae4e8a0f79111929710ea; 891a734353efdaa83e4c866bc23379466634d0d7; 6c65a23d580aa49cdb16f6259b0f08d587091d48; 352ce02d13f05c4c141b646c1dcbe95846fac4b3; e120403247976721bd0f35f9dbe7ab83ddf0a46a; 855f6c0887f09700453f082f9ceec8fd89e89fee; c15418d96083bfbc2af1d8d4fd7e07ea4320aa6d; 6ca4da57ec8fb240c08d17744d2d64754821fb27; 5fb3856273f7d0b8ce94f73e81ba94e59d37ce84; da9837f2eb6f209a1764cf2b2633b16ec14c818f; 857e79d394235529deafb66a1c9acd2d780ccd75; d3ac9175cb5d83830646c901c12736efbeb9eac7; dd1b3a3793619cec8994cc7cca10e6dee656fb7b; b77a86b4786666510a1372fecc0d1cc3c824f843; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; db2edcb874245f426d365c1b4dce6cf86bac694c; 255080a08a7a4a86c2c764d472436b1e89a03c60; 3aae8d99063e4bc096a1ea56b2396ec126cc706a; 7252006763b19fb267259d9d457901f38663692f; 3de97e99e70437fe73a9122d47be0eb773328a76; 8e0e1733c7fed13234bb5d003e157a53694d4769; 90e1a47ef95934f757541035227af2c913118f35; c5bec602a7216088d050aaafeaa2019e450b8ee0; 9e9a53a87197a3eddd10ba0da7d6406ed992d87b,Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews,24 6,"

062cbbacc461e9d98d589561ccc8afbdd2c0c652,Genetic Association of Recovery from Eating Disorders: The Role of GABA Receptor SNPs,"Follow-up studies of eating disorders (EDs) suggest outcomes ranging from recovery to chronic illness or death, but predictors of outcome have not been consistently identified. We tested 5151 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in approximately 350 candidate genes for association with recovery from ED in 1878 women. Initial analyses focused on a strictly defined discovery cohort of women who were over age 25 years, carried a lifetime diagnosis of an ED, and for whom data were available regarding the presence (n=361 ongoing symptoms in the past year, ie, â€˜illâ€™) or absence (n=115 no symptoms in the past year, ie, â€˜recoveredâ€™) of ED symptoms. An intronic SNP (rs17536211) in GABRG1 showed the strongest statistical evidence of association (p=4.63 Ã— 10âˆ’6, false discovery rate (FDR)=0.021, odds ratio (OR)=0.46). We replicated these findings in a more liberally defined cohort of women age 25 years or younger (n=464 ill, n=107 recovered; p=0.0336, OR=0.68; combined sample p=4.57 Ã— 10âˆ’6, FDR=0.0049, OR=0.55). Enrichment analyses revealed that GABA (Î³-aminobutyric acid) SNPs were over-represented among SNPs associated at p<0.05 in both the discovery (Z=3.64, p=0.0003) and combined cohorts (Z=2.07, p=0.0388). In follow-up phenomic association analyses with a third independent cohort (n=154 ED cases, n=677 controls), rs17536211 was associated with trait anxiety (p=0.049), suggesting a possible mechanism through which this variant may influence ED outcome. These findings could provide new insights into the development of more effective interventions for the most treatment-resistant patients.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Cinnamon S.

3ee6ac767f4256c18eba21bd35bc1883624d7036,Soluble epoxide hydrolase derived lipid mediators are elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with sarcoidosis: a cross-sectional study,"BackgroundSarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory multi-organ disease almost always affecting the lungs. The etiology remains unknown, but the hallmark of sarcoidosis is formation of non-caseating epithelioid cells granulomas in involved organs. In Scandinavia, >â€‰30% of sarcoidosis patients have LÃ¶fgrenâ€™s syndrome (LS), an acute disease onset mostly indicating a favorable prognosis. The impact of dysregulation of lipid mediators, which has been investigated in other inflammatory disorders, is still unknown.MethodsUsing three different liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry targeted platforms (LC-MS/MS), we quantified a broad suite of lipid mediators including eicosanoids, sphingolipids and endocannabinoids in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from pulmonary sarcoidosis patients (nâ€‰=â€‰41) and healthy controls (nâ€‰=â€‰16).ResultsA total of 47 lipid mediators were consistently detected in BAL fluid of patients and controls. After false discovery rate adjustment, two products of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzyme, 11,12-dihydroxyeicosa-5,8,14-trienoic acid (11,12-DiHETrE, pâ€‰=â€‰4.4E-5, qâ€‰=â€‰1.2E-3, median fold changeâ€‰=â€‰6.0) and its regioisomer 14,15-dihydroxyeicosa-5,8,11-trienoic acid (14,15-DiHETrE, pâ€‰=â€‰3.6E-3, qâ€‰=â€‰3.2E-2, median fold changeâ€‰=â€‰1.8) increased in patients with sarcoidosis. Additional shifts were observed in sphingolipid metabolism, with a significant increase in palmitic acid-derived sphingomyelin (SM16:0, pâ€‰=â€‰1.3E-3, qâ€‰=â€‰1.7E-2, median fold changeâ€‰=â€‰1.3). No associations were found between these 3 lipid mediators and LS, whereas levels of SM 16:0 and 11,12-DiHETrE associated with radiological stage (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), and levels of 14,15-DiHETrE were associated with the BAL fluid CD4/CD8 ratio.ConclusionsThese observed shifts in lipid mediators provide new insights into the pathobiology of sarcoidosis and in particular highlight the sEH pathway to be dysregulated in disease.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Marcus O.

A Bayesian information capacity criterion is defined for the selection of designs that are robust to the form of the linear predictor. For binomial data and logistic regression, the effectiveness of these designs for screening is assessed through simulation studies using all-subsets regression and model selection via maximum penalised likelihood and a generalised information criterion. For Poisson data and log-linear regression, similar assessments are made using maximum likelihood and the Akaike information criterion for minimally-supported designs that are constructed analytically. The results show that effective screening, that is, high power with moderate type I error rate and false discovery rate, can be achieved through suitable choices for the number of design support points and experiment size. Logistic regression is shown to present a more challenging problem than log-linear regression.

bd3e778fce8a5c2a77251059307612a376db4b81,Abstract 05: A pilot gene-environment-wide interaction study (GEWIS) of neurocognitive impairment in childhood medulloblastoma survivors.,"Introduction: Neurocognitive impairment after radiation therapy is a significant complication in cancer patients, affecting every age group; however pediatric populations are the most vulnerable. Medulloblastoma is the most common central nervous system malignancy in children, and craniospinal radiation is an essential part of standard treatment. While 5-year survival is approximately 70% due to advances in treatment, at least half of the survivors develop progressive and permanent neurocognitive impairment. To date, few risk factors for these adverse outcomes have been identified. Neurocognitive impairment is believed to be a complex process affected by genes, environmental factors, and their interactions. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an important method for identifying main genetic effects, that is, associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and prognosis. However, scanning for main effects might miss important genetic variants among those with unique environmental exposures. Therefore, we employed a 2-step approach utilizing GWAS data for detecting loci involved in gene-environment interactions to determine predictors of neurocognitive impairment. This approach (the gene-environment-wide interaction study or GEWIS) is a powerful alternative to single-step interaction tests.

Methods: Childhood medulloblastoma survivors were recruited from the long-term survivor clinics at Texas Children's Cancer Center and MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2003 and 2010. Working memory was assessed using age-appropriate intelligence scales for children, which included scores for verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ), and full scale IQ (FSIQ). We defined neurocognitive impairment as a score of <77.5 on any of the three IQ subscales. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from medical records. Exposure to ambient levels of benzene (a suspected environmental neurotoxicant) was estimated using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Assessment System for Population Exposure Nationwide (ASPEN) model. Genotyping was conducted using the Illumina Human 1M Quad SNP Chip. Exposure and genotype data were available on 47 subjects (20 with neurocognitive impairment and 27 without neurocognitive impairment). In step 1, we examined the association between each SNP (G) and benzene exposure (E) using a Wald test based on a logistic regression model. SNPs where p <0.001 were then included in step 2, a case-control analysis of GxE interactions using logistic regression models with the constrained maximum-likelihood method. Analyses were conducted using the â€˜CGENâ€™ package in R. As this was a pilot study, the false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled at 0.25.

Results: Benzene exposure was positively associated with neurocognitive impairment (OR = 2.0, 95% CI: 0.39-10.16); however, the association was not statistically significant. In step 1 of the preliminary analysis, seven SNPs were associated with neurocognitive impairment (p <0.001). Among this set, two GxE interactions were significantly associated with neurocognitive impairment (rs1223760-benzene, p = 0.014, q = 0.085 and rs11932152-benzene, p = 0.060, q = 0.182). Interestingly, rs1223760 is an intergenic SNP between PROX1 and SMYD2 , two genes suspected of influencing DNA methylation.

Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first GEWIS of neurocognitive impairment in survivors of childhood medulloblastoma. As the genetic architecture of neurocognitive impairment is complex, it is important to explore interactions using high-dimensional data. Our results are suggestive that GxE interactions may be important in prognosis; however, the results are preliminary and must be validated in a larger and independent population.

a05ee796fa2abf28c8c1f6b145403d1748b8c63f,Defining the nasal transcriptome in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's).,"OBJECTIVE
To determine whether disease processes related to granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) (GPA) are reflected in gene expression profiles of the nasal mucosa.


METHODS
Nasal brushings of the inferior turbinate were obtained from 32 patients with GPA (10 with active nasal disease, 13 with prior nasal disease, and 9 with no history of nasal disease) and a composite comparator group with and without inflammatory nasal disease (12 healthy people, 15 with sarcoidosis, and 8 with allergic rhinitis). Differential gene expression was assessed between subgroups of GPA and comparators.


RESULTS
A total of 339 genes were differentially expressed between the GPA and comparator groups (absolute fold change >1.5; false discovery rate <0.05). Top canonical pathways up-regulated in nasal brushings from patients with GPA included granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis (Pâ€‰=â€‰8.6(-22) ), agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis (Pâ€‰=â€‰1.3(-14) ), IL10 signaling (Pâ€‰=â€‰3.0(-11) ), LXR/RXR activation (Pâ€‰=â€‰4.3(-11) ), and TREM1 signaling (Pâ€‰=â€‰9.0(-11) ). A set of genes differentially expressed in GPA independently of nasal disease activity status included genes related to epithelial barrier integrity (fibronectin 1, desmosomal proteins) and several matricellular proteins (e.g., osteonectin, osteopontin). Significant overlap of differentially expressed genes was observed between active and prior nasal disease GPA subgroups. Peripheral blood neutrophil and mononuclear gene expression levels associated with GPA were similarly altered in the nasal gene expression profiles of patients with active or prior nasal disease.


CONCLUSION
Profiling the nasal transcriptome in GPA reveals gene expression signatures related to innate immunity, inflammatory cell chemotaxis, extracellular matrix composition, and epithelial barrier integrity. Thus, airway-based expression profiling is feasible and informative in GPA.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Peter C Grayson"", ids = ""8374184""); list(name = ""Katrina A Steiling"", ids = ""6601918""); list(name = ""Michael P.

9d1d82a0f0c7a3ac54e40219cc627967bfcd1906,Efficient statistical analysis of large correlated multivariate datasets: a case study on brain connectivity matrices,"In neuroimaging, a large number of correlated tests are routinely performed to detect active voxels in single-subject experiments or to detect regions that differ between individuals belonging to different groups. In order to bound the probability of a false discovery of pair-wise differences, a Bonferroni or other correction for multiplicity is necessary. These corrections greatly reduce the power of the comparisons which means that small signals (differences) remain hidden and therefore have been more or less successful depending on the application. We introduce a method that improves the power of a family of correlated statistical tests by reducing their number in an orderly fashion using our a-priori understanding of the problem . The tests are grouped by blocks that respect the data structure and only one or a few tests per group are performed. For each block we construct an appropriate summary statistic that characterizes a meaningful feature of the block. The comparisons are based on these summary statistics by a block-wise approach. We contrast this method with the one based on the individual measures in terms of power. Finally, we apply the method to compare brain connectivity matrices. Although the method is used in this study on the particular case of imaging, the proposed strategy can be applied to a large variety of problems that involves multiple comparisons when the tests can be grouped according to attributes that depend on the specific problem.

We consider adapting the Benjamini-Hochberg method for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) and the Bonferroni method for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER) to such dependence structure without losing their ultimate controls over the FDR and FWER, respectively, in a non-asymptotic setting. We present variants of conventional adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg and Bonferroni methods with proofs of their respective controls over the FDR and FWER. Numerical evidence is presented to show that these new adaptive methods can capture the present dependence structure more effectively than the corresponding conventional adaptive methods. This paper offers a solution to the open problem of constructing adaptive FDR and FWER controlling methods under dependence in a non-asymptotic setting and providing real improvements over the corresponding non-adaptive ones.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Wenge Guo"", ids = ""47032935""); list(name = ""Sanat K.

8059b084b5f68354c91bb36ada6c591c4505ef60,Extending Genetic Linkage Analysis to Diffusion Tensor Images to Map Single Gene Effects on Brain Fiber Architecture,"We extended genetic linkage analysis--an analysis widely used in quantitative genetics--to 3D images to analyze single gene effects on brain fiber architecture. We collected 4 Tesla diffusion tensor images (DTI) and genotype data from 258 healthy adult twins and their non-twin siblings. After high-dimensional fluid registration, at each voxel we estimated the genetic linkage between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), Val66Met (dbSNP number rs6265), of the BDNF gene (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) with fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from each subject's DTI scan, by fitting structural equation models (SEM) from quantitative genetics. We also examined how image filtering affects the effect sizes for genetic linkage by examining how the overall significance of voxelwise effects varied with respect to full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian smoothing applied to the FA images. Raw FA maps with no smoothing yielded the greatest sensitivity to detect gene effects, when corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure. The BDNF polymorphism significantly contributed to the variation in FA in the posterior cingulate gyrus, where it accounted for around 90-95% of the total variance in FA. Our study generated the first maps to visualize the effect of the BDNF gene on brain fiber integrity, suggesting that common genetic variants may strongly determine white matter integrity.",2009,Psychology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ming-Chang Chiang"", ids = ""48748655""); list(name = ""Christina Avedissian"", ids = ""2993738""); list(name = ""Marina Barysheva"", ids = ""2221666""); list(name = ""Arthur W.

cd4a7cb18bffb294fc6aa6f6e31b728058081248,A prognostic signature of G(2) checkpoint function in melanoma cell lines.,"As DNA damage checkpoints are barriers to carcinogenesis, G(2) checkpoint function was quantified to test for override of this checkpoint during melanomagenesis. Primary melanocytes displayed an effective G(2) checkpoint response to ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage. Thirty-seven percent of melanoma cell lines displayed a significant defect in G(2) checkpoint function. Checkpoint function was melanoma subtype-specific with ""epithelial-like"" melanoma lines, with wild type NRAS and BRAF displaying an effective checkpoint, while lines with mutant NRAS and BRAF displayed defective checkpoint function. Expression of oncogenic B-Raf in a checkpoint-effective melanoma attenuated G(2) checkpoint function significantly but modestly. Other alterations must be needed to produce the severe attenuation of G(2) checkpoint function seen in some BRAF-mutant melanoma lines. Quantitative trait analysis tools identified mRNA species whose expression was correlated with G(2) checkpoint function in the melanoma lines. A 165 gene signature was identified with a high correlation with checkpoint function (p < 0.004) and low false discovery rate (â‰¤ 0.077). The G(2) checkpoint gene signature predicted G(2) checkpoint function with 77-94% accuracy. The signature was enriched in lysosomal genes and contained numerous genes that are associated with regulation of chromatin structure and cell cycle progression. The core machinery of the cell cycle was not altered in checkpoint-defective lines but rather numerous mediators of core machinery function were. When applied to an independent series of primary melanomas, the predictive G(2) checkpoint signature was prognostic of distant metastasis-free survival. These results emphasize the value of expression profiling of primary melanomas for understanding melanoma biology and disease prognosis.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Bernard Oguna Omolo"", ids = ""3158412""); list(name = ""Craig C Carson"", ids = ""20496167""); list(name = ""Haitao Chu"", ids = ""145905894""); list(name = ""Yingchun Zhou"", ids = ""9486456""); list(name = ""D.

But it remains unresolved about the molecular mechanisms involved in the development and reproduction regulation of schistosomes. This study tested and compared the metabolic profiles of the male and female Schistosoma japonicum worms collected from SCID mice and BALB/c mice at 5 weeks post infection using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) platform, in which the worms from SCID mice were the investigated organisms and the worms from BALB/c mice were used as the controls. There were 1015 ion features in ESI+ mode and 342 ion features in ESI- mode were identified after filtration by false discovery rate. Distinct metabolic profiles were found to clearly differentiate both male and female worms in SCID mice from those in BALB/c mice using multivariate modeling methods including the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), and Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA). There were more differential metabolites in female worms than in male worms between SCID mice and BALB/c mice. And common and uniquely perturbed metabolites and pathways were identified among male and female worms from SCID mice when compared with BALB/c mice. The enriched metabolite sets of the differential metabolites in male worms between SCID mice and BALB/c mice included bile acid biosynthesis, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, retinol metabolism, purine metabolism, etc. And the enriched metabolite sets of differential metabolites in female worms included retinol metabolism, alpha linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolism, purine metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, glutamate metabolism, etc. Further detection and comparison in transcript abundance of genes of the perturbed retinol metabolism and its associated meiosis process in worms identified clues suggesting accumulated retinyl ester and perturbed meiotic process. These findings suggested an association between the schistosome with retarded growth and development in SCID mice and their perturbed metabolites and metabolic pathways, and provided a new insight into the growth and development regulation of S. japonicum worms from the metabolic level, which indicated great clues for discovery of drugs or vaccines against the parasites and disease with more researches.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rong Liu"", ids = ""143741728""); list(name = ""Wen-jun Cheng"", ids = ""13442124""); list(name = ""Hong-bin Tang"", ids = ""32098770""); list(name = ""Qin-ping Zhong"", ids = ""11663291""); list(name = ""Z.

7508b7246ee4dc1ce98a93a123317aab2058bb87,A full Bayesian partition model for identifying hypo- and hyper-methylated loci from single nucleotide resolution sequencing data,"BackgroudDNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays important roles on gene regulation. Study of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing brings the availability of DNA methylation at single CpG resolution. The main interest of study on DNA methylation data is to test the methylation difference under two conditions of biological samples. However, the high cost and complexity of this sequencing experiment limits the number of biological replicates, which brings challenges to the development of statistical methods.ResultsBayesian modeling is well known to be able to borrow strength across the genome, and hence is a powerful tool for high-dimensional- low-sample- size data. In order to provide accurate identification of methylation loci, especially for low coverage data, we propose a full Bayesian partition model to detect differentially methylated loci under two conditions of scientific study. Since hypo-methylation and hyper-methylation have distinct biological implication, it is desirable to differentiate these two types of differential methylation. The advantage of our Bayesian model is that it can produce one-step output of each locus being either equal-, hypo- or hyper-methylated locus without further post-hoc analysis. An R package named as MethyBayes implementing the proposed full Bayesian partition model will be submitted to the bioconductor website upon publication of the manuscript.ConclusionsThe proposed full Bayesian partition model outperforms existing methods in terms of power while maintaining a low false discovery rate based on simulation studies and real data analysis including bioinformatics analysis.",2015,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Henan Wang"", ids = ""2379583""); list(name = ""Chong He"", ids = ""48128884""); list(name = ""Garima Kushwaha"", ids = ""3167639""); list(name = ""Dong Xu"", ids = ""145481070""); list(name = ""Jing Qiu"", ids = ""46392759"")",2afac1303522364edc48a2e629af44a8345a360e,85350c2a270a760864721c3ed36996ed5409a243; c68001e5f2923ab5f1012ef5ae20523a67be422f; 014bb1d12e0637dd1c92d34a047054de293f584a; 458c710edad89bdac80086da07a8e19dc2c6002f; ac2c550206d2ffb646f5c3f94cbc1dc71525d3fe; bdeaa7b81ea59529dffaf9b8703287f61459dfa2; 4713ac9828e0cee2a28df34e3a52abadf0afb577; 4dcb88c66e3c04b8642b5d5fcd08f2f34b4129e5; 534bfbfcbdbf16f289e11069e20ed0777bbe650f; 9bf0123dca62945783a55a99d712e93357a38539; d60a50edfed57fbc51cf2062de78a035fd440582; d491a128212184c658dec599e36b91b193565c22; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; 8f35cc66c34edb05b0a3ba5ec2cb98a3de321bc1; 1e930c6c3e7206a7a48167e2d534bc1c5514820b; f14b49d2b8459ad9861d1bd0b52260513a7e446f; 9f5782bec93d2a1fc00cb6e783717ad032d5913b; cce536dd3cc8d619307716ce8e8e95c4c274b5e9; 449f7b63f133bb26a93cbf2deaf632331f608adb,BMC Bioinformatics,17,
1ef83b2b980b406db708adb6104533be05af9854,Assigning significance to peptides identified by tandem mass spectrometry using decoy databases.,"Automated methods for assigning peptides to observed tandem mass spectra typically return a list of peptide-spectrum matches, ranked according to an arbitrary score. In this article, we describe methods for converting these arbitrary scores into more useful statistical significance measures. These methods employ a decoy sequence database as a model of the null hypothesis, and use false discovery rate (FDR) analysis to correct for multiple testing. We first describe a simple FDR inference method and then describe how estimating and taking into account the percentage of incorrectly identified spectra in the entire data set can lead to increased statistical power.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lukas KÃ¤ll"", ids = ""2440976""); list(name = ""John D.

4354d139f14a6a507962f45bb8829b6c8696d509,Potential Bias in GO: : TermFinder,"The increased need for multiple statistical comparisons under conditions of non-independence in bioinformatics applications, such as DNA microarray data analysis, has led to the development of alternatives to the conventional Bonferroni correction for adjusting P-values. The use of the false discovery rate (FDR), in particular, has grown considerably. However, the calculation of the FDR frequently depends on drawing random samples from a population, and inappropriate sampling will result in a bias in the calculated FDR. In this work, we demonstrate a bias due to incorrect random sampling in the widely used GO::TermFinder package. Both T(2) and permutation tests are used to confirm the bias for a test set of data, which leads to an overestimation of the FDR of about 10%. A simple fix to the random sampling method is proposed to remove the bias.",2009,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Robert M. Flight"", ids = ""1802141""); list(name = ""Peter D.

bd703825401b26578b9f612ba2d3519b2a163997,Analysis of the DISC1 translocation partner (11q14.3) in genetic risk of schizophrenia.,"The Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) locus on human chromosome 1 was identified as a consequence of its involvement in a balanced translocation (1;11)(q42.1;q14.3) segregating with major psychiatric disorders in a Scottish family. Recently a comprehensive meta-analysis of genome-wide association scan data found no evidence that common variants of DISC1 (1q42.1) are associated with schizophrenia. Our aim was to test for association of variants in the 11q14.3 translocation region with schizophrenia. The 11q14.3 region was examined by meta-analysis of genome-wide scan data made available by the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) and other investigators (non-GAIN) through dbGap. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) approach. There were no single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significant (P < 0.05) after correction for multiple testing in the combined schizophrenia dataset. However, one SNP (rs2509382) was significantly associated in the male-only analysis with P(FDR) â€‰=â€‰0.024. Whilst the relevance of the (1;11)(q42.1;q14.3) translocation to psychiatric disorders is currently specific to the Scottish family, genetic material in the chromosome 11 region may contain risk variants for psychiatric disorders in the wider population. The association found in this region does warrant follow-up analysis in further sample sets.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Roberta Farrugia Debono"", ids = ""46178223""); list(name = ""Ruth Topless"", ids = ""5934543""); list(name = ""David Markie"", ids = ""6438252""); list(name = ""Michael A.

d179ec4e378f32e77ed22fce7a7e50f598d2ab4c,Activated immune-inflammatory pathways are associated with long-standing depressive symptoms: Evidence from gene-set enrichment analyses in the Young Finns Study.,"We used genome wide expression (GWE) data of circulating blood cells and pathway analysis to investigate the inflammatory and other molecular pathways that may be associated with long-standing depressive symptoms. Participants were 607 women and 316 men (mean age 42 years) from the Young Finns Study who participated in three consecutive study phases in 2001, 2007 and 2012. Using Gene-set enrichment analyses (GSEA) we focused our analyses to pathways (available in MSigDB database) that are likely to affect immunological and inflammatory processes. GSEA were performed for blood cell GWE data in 2012. Depressive symptoms were assessed using a modified 21-item Beck Depression Inventory in each of the three study phases. Participants who scored in the top quartile of depressive symptoms in each of the three measurement points (n = 191) differed from other participants (n = 732) in several gene-set pathways related to inflammatory processes or immune-inflammatory signaling including interleukin (IL-1) pathway, and pathways related to various immuno-inflammatory processes, such as toll-like, the NEF protein, the nuclear factor kB, the kinase AKT and the mature B cell antigen receptor pathway (false discovery rates, FDRs<0.12).

92fa8d55cec9d455a707430faeedafa35f54c85c,Hepatic Metabolomic Analysis in Mice Fed a High Fat Diet with Watermelon and Watermelon Byproducts Shows Improved Lipid Metabolism and Reduction of Chronic Inflammation (P06-023-19).,"Objectives
Watermelon is a nutrient-dense fruit shown previously to produce health benefits, particularly regarding blood pressure regulation. We tested the hypothesis that intake of whole watermelon flesh and value-added watermelon components would improve metabolic conditions in C57BL/6 J male mice fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet modeling an obesogenic Western diet (HF). We further hypothesize that metabolomic profiling will show changes in relative levels of compounds related to lipid and glucose metabolism, and chronic inflammation.


Methods
In a prior study (Becraft et al., 2018), groups of mice (nÂ =Â 8) were provided either low-fat diet (LF, 10% kcal fat), high-fat diet (HF, 45% kcal fat), HF plus Watermelon Skin (HF + WS), HF plus Watermelon Rind (HF + WR), or HF plus Watermelon Flesh (HF + WF) for 10 weeks. Watermelon flesh was provided at 10% of total energy and skin and rind were added at âˆ¼ 0.2% (w/w) of diet. After ten weeks, animals were euthanized, and liver tissue saved for metabolomic analysis. Liver tissue samples were homogenized, and an identical mass equivalent of liver was subjected to methanol extraction and split into aliquots for analysis by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry in the positive, negative or polar ion mode. There were 709 biochemicals identified and analyzed between groups. Welch's 2-sample t-test was performed with ArrayStudio (Omicsoft) or R software on log transformed data to compare data between experimental groups. Estimate of the false discovery rate (Q value) was calculated and Q ;< 0.05 used as an indication of high confidence in a result.


Results
Principal component analysis showed segregation of groups along three different components, representing 24.8%, 19.4%, and 9.0% of the variation. Profound differences were found in LF vs. HF liver tissue. Compared to HF-fed mice, mice fed WF showed reduced levels of bile acids and pro-inflammatory compounds 12-HETE, 15, HETE, and PGF2 (all PÂ <Â 0.05) in the liver.


Conclusions
In mice consuming a high-fat western style diet, regular intake of watermelon flesh, and fiber-rich products made from rind and skin all improved metabolism as evidenced by metabolomic analysis of liver tissue. Most notably were reductions in pro-inflammatory compounds including HETEs and Prostaglandin F2.

c309cba86f0291f341570c8c1baaf3c98af8fa84,Physiology and mRNA expression in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) after long-term exposure to the new antifoulant medetomidine.,"Medetomidine is under evaluation for use as an antifouling agent, and its effects on non-target aquatic organisms are therefore of interest. In this study, rainbow trout was exposed to low (0.5 and 5.0nM) concentrations of medetomidine for up to 54 days. Recently we have reported on effects on paleness and melanophore aggregation of medetomidine in these fish. Here, specific growth rates were investigated together with a broad set of physiological parameters including plasma levels of growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and leptin, glucose and haemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), condition factor, liver and heart somatic indexes (LSI, HSI). Hepatic enzyme activities of CYP1A (EROD activity), glutathione S-transferases (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) were also measured. Additionally, hepatic mRNA expression was analysed through microarray and quantitative PCR in fish sampled after 31 days of exposure. Medetomidine at both concentrations significantly lowered blood glucose levels and the higher concentration significantly reduced the LSI. The mRNA expression analysis revealed few differentially expressed genes in the liver and the false discovery rate was high.

274a34e21679c9554d69a3983fcfe8352ef763bb,Assessing the contributions of childhood maltreatment subtypes and depression case-control status on telomere length reveals a specific role of physical neglect,"BACKGROUND
Studies have provided evidence that both childhood maltreatment and depressive disorders are associated with shortened telomere lengths. However, as childhood maltreatment is a risk factor for depression, it remains unclear whether this may be driving shortened telomere lengths observed amongst depressed patients. Furthermore, it's unclear if the effects of maltreatment on telomere length shortening are more pervasive amongst depressed patients relative to controls, and consequently whether biological ageing may contribute to depression's pathophysiology. The current study assesses the effects of childhood maltreatment, depression case/control status, and the interactive effect of both childhood maltreatment and depression case/control status on relative telomere length (RTL).


METHOD
DNA samples from 80 depressed subjects and 100 control subjects were utilized from a U.K. sample (ages 20-84), with childhood trauma questionnaire data available for all participants. RTL was quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reactions. Univariate linear regression analyses were used to assess the effects of depression status, childhood maltreatment and depression by childhood maltreatment interactions on RTL. The false discovery rate (q<0.05) was used for multiple testing correction.


RESULTS
Analysis of depression case/control status showed no significant main effect on RTL. Four subtypes of childhood maltreatment also demonstrated no significant main effect on RTL, however a history of physical neglect did significantly predict shorter RTL in adulthood (F(1, 174)=7.559, p=0.007, q=0.042, Variance Explained=4.2%), which was independent of case/control status. RTL was further predicted by severity of physical neglect, with the greatest differences observed in older maltreated individuals (>50 years old). There were no significant depression case/control status by childhood maltreatment interactions.


LIMITATIONS
A relatively small sample limited our power to detect interaction effects, and we were unable to consider depression chronicity or recurrence.


CONCLUSION
Shortened RTL was specifically associated with childhood physical neglect, but not the other subtypes of maltreatment or depression case/control status. Our results suggest that the telomere-eroding effects of physical neglect may represent a biological mechanism important in increasing risk for ageing-related disorders. As physical neglect is more frequent amongst depressed cases generally, it may also represent a confounding factor driving previous associations between shorter RTL and depression case status.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""John B.

0443324351d417e02e5b8da68b3ef5e23b9dfe68,Cortical Thickness Alterations in Chronic Pain Disorder: An Exploratory MRI Study,"Objective Chronic pain disorder (CPD) has been associated with brain changes, especially in limbic circuits. However, in most patients with chronic pain, depression or anxiety is a common comorbidity. In this exploratory and naturalistic study, we investigated brain cortical thickness (CTh) differences between patients with CPD and healthy controls, with consideration of concurrent psychiatric symptoms. Methods Twenty-three patients with CPD and 23 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were included in this study. CTh was estimated using Freesurfer on high-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted images acquired with a 3T scanner. Group differences were investigated using an analysis of covariance model that included age, sex, and Beck Depression Inventory I and Trait Anxiety Inventory scores as covariates. The relationship between CTh and Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) scores was also investigated in patients. Data were corrected for multiplicity using the False Discovery Rate approach (q < .05). Results The comparison between groups using demographics and Beck Depression Inventory I scores as covariates showed thinner cortex in patients compared with controls, after correction for multiplicity in the left precentral (F(1,42) = 21.9, p < .05) and postcentral gyri (F(1,42) = 26.9, p < .05) and in the left inferior temporal sulcus (F(1,42) = 19.6, p < .05). Moreover, using the Trait Anxiety Inventory as covariate, a trend toward significance (p < .001 uncorrected) was seen for the left precentral gyrus (F(1,42) = 13.8), right middle frontal (F(1,42) = 14.3) and inferior parietal gyri (F(1,42) = 13.4), and right anterior temporal pole (F(1,42) = 15.9). Conclusions The results indicate that brain morphological differences between patients with chronic pain disorder and healthy controls are localized to regions that correspond to sensory as well as affective dimensions of pain processing.",2018,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Stefano Magon"", ids = ""2404270""); list(name = ""Till Sprenger"", ids = ""2185718""); list(name = ""Alexander Otti"", ids = ""4601116""); list(name = ""Athina Papadopoulou"", ids = ""153884253""); list(name = ""Harald Guendel"", ids = ""4213764""); list(name = ""Michael Noll-Hussong"", ids = ""1398144774"")",55e6b81352615b8369e3d423fe8e71c9364bcd52; 8e65f2683facbf1c3524c921ee42444b8329e0a8,52aef325c7f257051cc780fe044c0b40e0c6d085; 64f5372bacf15a2b4188c99a8dcee7c13ca89e92; 75c2f465d59739dbc06b70fd34dc3c1b2336103e; 95bb00a54c5d6ea535f7cc3b4fde173499ed6145; 236cb915a1724c4b9ec3e53cfed64ce169358cda; df4afc11574acb62dc9d7c6db93a59cbea138d17; 8303e0668d34dbe62817cf0f7763e5a418ab38af; f3dc95c15a3105f92c959e521b8f8f07bf995fa7; 54906ab25b083b499f30b72d1fd55b7e8dd0cb6f; 7050d64a29e570f8bb0ba316a7bb2af4aa8b72cc; 5658f8c8d592ca3692a9e7985546e04864b9160d; d74999eea0285afd0d2b1b5a264cbf55f007131e; 64acdc55c7eacbde97ad5be7eeedc3e4dd4ccca7; c402b3ef49f407a4410e724bec0b001c72b0dae6; 94fbae6ac64ad6f514965a348abb4bf81df62a9f; dce69be800efe769aaef8817aecc26b820f93ad9; af6fd500fc34888ca3a80476b568d04b6aa13cee; 57b51f057bfe368f7ca3f743375f3884fbadbb5c; f949fc80a33510fd8a2c98afe1a534a39ba00982; d843aa665c5eada0f196a52b7498e93ed931ef83; e62e9178ee780bb692c696aa3793e51144474b90; 01f57aa8511bf2b12f301a00cef9cbfccedd9e86; 3adaba57cecfac08a55558e2a0339f1028b9be4e; 3fedd0ee51e97920692fe74af0d6f67bd90fe8f4; 7b3f1fc53f30a3066bff293b8ce917275bfd8d67; 7f01a9af1367e0034900221af905a1f4f5e554a5; af3f2ecdf85585481eb09238a14d77b7d15f56e7; 63ab7e3390660152c76598a39b5cba761b39d212; c26e3675c43af90a505e30328e05ff6d600e4445; aa3e94b583ba17c7b757ec38873cbdf683329b37; a47c446b43e868c7d5d9c353deedaf704884ad9a; b9db1aad56121cd520fa37dcddc1a682b23f3737; cd8a6c74aff76ef1defe9ba37824f84cb778b848; c3f0e2f7d78b0edd172213ec5a4ef15935c83ed9; a208120fde3a76397c612ca55e6fe6ca8032025a; dbcc5fdd115fc1d996615579779188506142f945; e4b61c636b078042d05cb231091078538dc8ec00; be2e4a03a36f8e6315f49370fec9d57a84865041; 364dbc709e9c4217d4024582bd28ea8b43a61e0e; e7fe379ff1fa2b9a0bafb321db27539d8064f559; 33ebf20498671b0206783cfe0ebd0bbffa9747e2; 1a81a5e337979401b96a2c071878f4e11dc21b13; 01e2cd15216d66e13e639674527a8a13bb355898; 609a2bf0400c8c8c6062f4cf80230edbb419943e; 381269782f157ecc4aa420c343a1fe83e3fce01a; 2698b7ad186e1f04abf10df3e8e1d6c4a9d6e6de; a9b305dcb6a2f87c66ef1bd5acac85f48bf4ff75; 9260c5cc3e74c639d589938ae1d9b464ae11ec68; 431c2b62bec1614caccf3f78151bd23d9495ce6c; 4d0a3f199a1331cf5b345e5b974c2694e5547f69; 1e14c2ae12186acfaf1e677a8c3569e534f6217e; a96d69b3b45d6893f287a2b91ad658606168599b; b2a744e083fb18d9444d587b1eb4e64b091b9890; d578ccae01b6190f36c18f5a680fc5d44ed17360; 39694958792e145b75eec55007e6e1defc8105d6; d8c44b1cd38a27c78af9c9444d8be019e2f26417; 65387baccc53689292f65a1a27e93d85e4207e6a; b3db96b5e8328ca08c31c3ee2c268333044a5152; dcadc8fc5bf5534c20824842d8719e33c4ee2640; cea1915144036f2979780ac95a2bb8e4b1169c8d; cb3f6550be63074ca6af2b38d66f43eb48e44855; 08ddd11e65a5c140b56f991103a3cbca124b69a6; 022b1d87ed14677d29341fd4f7a8a59e3bb85ce3; 1351b51fcefe5e51c412e6c7722b8113ddeeca62; 4e23fc40e2256a062d1c82546bf677da7554947f; c3884715de405d4add34bc15790b465a46b0f47d; 1738da20022bf5de27aa04594eead35957fe07db; 6468f2d0e7b8317a790271aee53536c7e885d26b; e0f0c0e09e0c3019b73990ccc31d83841c238aed; 9eef93fbc3d949d1def0337ada0dfd06ae912746; 90175f49527cc07a19a3429d6efddd63f0aa54de; 844dd151dbbc318f70917e2c8396565319f6ced1,Psychosomatic Medicine,80,592â€“598
1dbc42c6b4062ab0cdebc595ce9ec90901795b09,Genome-wide association study of sepsis in extremely premature infants,"Objective To identify genetic variants associated with sepsis (early-onset and late-onset) using a genome-wide association (GWA) analysis in a cohort of extremely premature infants. Study design Previously generated GWA data from the Neonatal Research Network's anonymised genomic database biorepository of extremely premature infants were used for this study. Sepsis was defined as culture-positive early-onset or late-onset sepsis or culture-proven meningitis. Genomic and whole-genome-amplified DNA was genotyped for 1.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); 91% of SNPs were successfully genotyped. We imputed 7.2 million additional SNPs. p Values and false discovery rates (FDRs) were calculated from multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for gender, gestational age and ancestry. Target statistical value was p<10âˆ’5. Secondary analyses assessed associations of SNPs with pathogen type. Pathway analyses were also run on primary and secondary end points. Results Data from 757 extremely premature infants were included: 351 infants with sepsis and 406 infants without sepsis. No SNPs reached genome-wide significance levels (5Ã—10âˆ’8); two SNPs in proximity to FOXC2 and FOXL1 genes achieved target levels of significance. In secondary analyses, SNPs for ELMO1, IRAK2 (Gram-positive sepsis), RALA, IMMP2L (Gram-negative sepsis) and PIEZO2 (fungal sepsis) met target significance levels. Pathways associated with sepsis and Gram-negative sepsis included gap junctions, fibroblast growth factor receptors, regulators of cell division and interleukin-1-associated receptor kinase 2 (p values<0.001 and FDR<20%). Conclusions No SNPs met genome-wide significance in this cohort of extremely low birthweight infants; however, areas of potential association and pathways meriting further study were identified.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lakshmi Srinivasan"", ids = ""144837656""); list(name = ""G.

To achieve this, we applied automatic volumetric rigid and non-rigid inter-subject registration techniques to transform the two groups of hip QCT scans into a common reference hip space. Statistical comparison of the preand post-flight composite models illustrated tissue regions that showed the most serious bone loss inside the proximal femur. Based on the 16 subjects, such regions also showed statistical significance in bone loss according to voxel-by-voxel t-test and false discovery rate (FDR) analysis. By emphasizing on such most responsive regions, we can potentially develop more sensitive bone measurement methods for detecting and analyzing bone response to environmental and other factors, such as aging and osteoporosis drug therapies",2007,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Wen Jung Li"", ids = ""8652017""); list(name = ""Alain Koyama"", ids = ""38860914""); list(name = ""Isra Saeed"", ids = ""37934349""); list(name = ""Thomas Lang"", ids = ""143939739"")",,,2007 4th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,,700-703
653f1d6ed3f25c9148e43b207a2b4165d2e13307,Age-related changes in DNA methylation affect renal histology and post-transplant fibrosis.,"During ageing, kidney function decreases due to renal tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis and arteriosclerosis. Recently, changes in DNA methylation were shown to contribute to various ageing processes. However, it is unknown whether such changes also contribute to age-related kidney dysfunction. To assess this, we profiled genome-wide changes in DNA methylation (over 800 000 CpG sites) in 95 renal biopsies obtained prior to kidney transplantation from donors aged 16 to 73 years. Donor age significantly associated with the methylation of 92 778 CpGs (false discovery rate under 0.05), corresponding to 10 285 differentially methylated regions. These regions were most frequently located in genes involved in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Using an independent cohort of 67 biopsies, we autonomously validated these findings. Interestingly, the methylation status of these 92 778 age-related CpGs was associated with glomerulosclerosis (34.4% of CpGs at a false discovery rate under 0.05) and interstitial fibrosis (0.9%) and graft function at one year after transplantation, but not with tubular atrophy and arteriosclerosis. No association was observed with any of these pathologies at the time of transplantation (0% at a false discovery rate under 0.05). Thus, age-associated changes in DNA methylation at the time of transplantation predict future injury of transplanted kidneys. Specifically, our epigenome-wide association study demonstrates that epigenetic renal ageing is implicated in progressive fibrosis in both the glomerulus and the interstitium.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Line Heylen"", ids = ""5641897""); list(name = ""Bernard Thienpont"", ids = ""145782786""); list(name = ""Pieter Busschaert"", ids = ""4460814""); list(name = ""Ben Sprangers"", ids = ""6151033""); list(name = ""Dirk Kuypers"", ids = ""3240643""); list(name = ""Matthieu Moisse"", ids = ""46632057""); list(name = ""Evelyne Lerut"", ids = ""10106116""); list(name = ""Diether Lambrechts"", ids = ""145415933""); list(name = ""Maarten Naesens"", ids = ""3911170"")",,,Kidney international,,
b59d4aa6a864afbd387b956bb834b9a7a1cfff52,The effect of camelina sativa oil and fish intakes on fatty acid compositions of blood lipid fractions.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Blood lipid fractions serve as objective biomarkers of dietary fat intake. It is unclear which fatty acid pool most accurately reflects the dietary intakes of different n-3 PUFAs. We aimed to investigate the effect of fish and camelina sativa oil (CSO) intakes on fatty acid composition of erythrocyte membranes (EM), plasma phospholipids (PL), cholesteryl esters (CE) and triglycerides (TG). We also aimed to identify the most appropriate blood lipid fraction for assessing n-3 PUFA intake.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Altogether 79 volunteers with impaired glucose metabolism were randomly assigned either to CSO, fatty fish, lean fish or control groups for 12 weeks. Fatty acid compositions of lipid pools were measured by gas chromatography. The proportion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) increased in all lipid pools in the CSO group (false discovery rate (FDR) pÂ <Â 0.001 for all). Similarly, the proportions of EPA and DHA increased in all lipid fractions in the fatty fish group (FDR pÂ <Â 0.001 for EM, PL and CE; FDR pÂ =Â 0.005 for TG; FDR pÂ <Â 0.001 for EM, PL, CE; FDR pÂ <Â 0.007 for TG, respectively). Changes in the dietary intakes of ALA, EPA and DHA correlated with the changes in their proportions in all lipid pools (rÂ =Â 0.3-0.5, pÂ <Â 0.05).

5d7a16fd0b69f43121bd2abddeb368afcbb5a6da,TU-D-207B-06: Pathological Response Prediction by Radiomic Data From Primary and Lymph Nodes in NSCLC.,"PURPOSE
In advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient, metastasis can spread from the primary tumor to the lymph nodes and hence could have a distinct phenotype compared to unaffected nodes. In this study we investigated the complementary information of radiomics extracted from lymph nodes and the primary tumor in order to predict pathological response at time of surgery after chemoradiation in patients with stage II-III NSCLC.


METHODS
86 NSCLC patients with primary tumor and involved lymph nodes (LN) were included in this study. Twenty radiomic features were selected based on stability and variance. Predictive power was evaluated using AUC and false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-values. Conventional imaging features (total tumor / LN volume and axial tumor diameter) and clinical characteristics were included for comparison. Classification power was investigated using random forest. Performances were assessed using cross validation (1000 iterations, 70% training / 30% validation).


RESULTS
Three radiomic features were predictive for pathologic (GRD) gross residual disease (AUC range 0.69-0.75, p<0.05) and two pathologic (pCR) complete response (AUC range 0.65-0.68, p<0.05). No conventional imaging features were predictive of either outcome (range AUC = 0.51 to 0.61, p>0.05). Patients with pCR were likely to have more homogeneous LN (large area emphasis, AUC=0.74, p<0.05) when in the other hand patients with GRD present rounder primary tumor shape (spherical disproportionality, AUC= 0.68 p<0.05). Cross validation AUC values shown that the combined radiomics-clinical features set outperformed for each outcomes (median AUC = 0.68 and 0.74 respectively for pCR and GRD).


CONCLUSION
We demonstrate that LN phenotypic information, ascertained from radiomic features, is complementary to imaging features obtained from the primary tumor. These features are strongly associated with response to chemoradiation as determined by pathologic response and provide greater predictive performance than clinical characteristics and conventional assessment of tumor burden by diameter or volume.

There have been some methodology developments of mediation analysis with high-dimensional mediators. However, high-dimensional mediation analysis methods for time-to-event outcome data are still yet to be developed. To address these challenges, we propose a new high-dimensional mediation analysis procedure for survival models by incorporating sure independent screening and minimax concave penalty techniques for variable selection, with the Sobel and the joint method for significance test of indirect effect. The simulation studies show good performance in identifying correct biomarkers, false discovery rate control, and minimum estimation bias of the proposed procedure. We also apply this approach to study the causal pathway from smoking to overall survival among lung cancer patients potentially mediated by 365,307 DNA methylations in the TCGA lung cancer cohort. Mediation analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model estimates that patients who have serious smoking history increase the risk of lung cancer through methylation markers including cg21926276, cg27042065, and cg26387355 with significant hazard ratios of 1.2497(95%CI: 1.1121, 1.4045), 1.0920(95%CI: 1.0170, 1.1726), and 1.1489(95%CI: 1.0518, 1.2550), respectively. The three methylation sites locate in the three genes which have been showed to be associated with lung cancer event or overall survival. However, the three CpG sites (cg21926276, cg27042065 and cg26387355) have not been reported, which are newly identified as the potential novel epigenetic markers linking smoking and survival of lung cancer patients.

f3c9dea3a536913e3676bf379487f5d1cc92972b,Fast and accurate differential transcript usage by testing equivalence class counts.,"Background: RNA sequencing has enabled high-throughput and fine-grained quantitative analyses of the transcriptome. While differential gene expression is the most widely used application of this technology, RNA-seq data also has the resolution to infer differential transcript usage (DTU), which can elucidate the role of different transcript isoforms between experimental conditions, cell types or tissues. DTU has typically been inferred from exon-count data, which has issues with assigning reads unambiguously to counting bins, and requires alignment of reads to the genome. Recently, approaches have emerged that use transcript quantifications estimates directly for DTU. Transcript counts can be inferred from 'pseudo' or lightweight aligners, which are significantly faster than traditional genome alignment. However, recent evaluations show lower sensitivity in DTU analysis. Transcript abundances are estimated from equivalence classes (ECs), which determine the transcripts that any given read is compatible with. Recent work has proposed performing differential expression testing directly on equivalence class read counts (ECs). Methods: Here we demonstrate that ECs can be used effectively with existing count-based methods for detecting DTU. We evaluate this approach on simulated human and drosophila data, as well as on a real dataset through subset testing. Results: We find that ECs counts have similar sensitivity and false discovery rates as exon-level counts but can be generated in a fraction of the time through the use of pseudo-aligners. Conclusions: We posit that equivalence class read counts are a natural unit on which to perform many types of analysis.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Marek Cmero"", ids = ""2919496""); list(name = ""Nadia M Davidson"", ids = ""145299907""); list(name = ""Alicia Oshlack"", ids = ""2489165"")",87a75db37ea71192d69177202ea34fe101601789,efeda4443cb25c0aa9e18ff1d0d71a404d8734b4; da09c3e8cc017aeaa4bca0ee71c0e4d4ba4b6515; 121b776a10bda7e926260c05223948856f7f091f; 06c4e8ebe8c6f412d9dfea8bff64ba0cd68f32ab; c983edabba63e91cbd6fee4684657ab37981ecb4; f4c75321714b7a2a1dbb673b241713032c030faa; da15cb940b5854ee826e74d78f3b1085286ac785; d25075134d79c75d68f6164614c21f70a4f4f916; 5d642a2251943a5498bed69ca5bafecc54bfcc5d; 6d476ca3e8d742ef0e02bbec3c980662abc61fef; 78ce0c149860363bbbe34306c75a4454ad23828d; 949565e275b7f0f461c41825404d31be5b904b88; 90993067424d2fb196ef7b0e4a6ff69bdf12294b; da7667137e2b3ae2e9601e78a8f269715505f0fd; 2864e42b9de695fa7efc92d5e9aae7fe0ff31f6a; cd8d731b40b2304b61ac1ade1043fd39c5b4ab89; 641f193d8a04e195df197538db898e3925018bc3; 4fd7e1fa3b4f6b52632bfe525d4051e23bcf2bb8; fd2613c0e04eba3b8b068ffc0109c250387c2776,F1000Research,8,"

3d5e6a42322e11aa00b9da55e218bd27be551226,Transcriptomic analysis of circulating neutrophils in metabolically stressed peripartal grazing dairy cows.,"The high metabolic demand during the transition into lactation places cows at greater risk of metabolic and infectious disease than at any other time in their lactation cycle. Additionally, a change occurs in the innate immune response during this period, which contributes to increased risk of disease. In the current study, we compared the transcriptomes of neutrophils from dairy cows divergent in their metabolic health post-calving. Cows (n = 5 per risk group) were selected from a parent experiment (n = 45 cows). Those with high or low concentrations of plasma nonesterified fatty acids, plasma Î²-hydroxybutyrate, and liver triacylglycerol in both wk 1 and 2 were deemed to be at ""high risk"" (HR) or ""low risk"" (LR) of metabolic dysfunction, respectively. Circulating neutrophils were isolated at 3 time points during the transition period (d 0 and wk 1 and 4 post-calving), and gene expression was analyzed using RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression between the risk groups was determined using edgeR (http://bioconductor.org), and pathway analysis was conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Statistical analysis indicated no interaction between risk and week. Therefore, the overall effect of risk was analyzed across all time points. In total, 3,500 genes were differentially expressed between the HR and LR cows (false discovery rate < 0.05). Of these, 2,897 genes were identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and used for pathway analysis. Of the relevant pathways identified, neutrophils isolated from HR cows showed downregulation of genes involved in the recruitment of granulocytes, interferon signaling, and apoptosis, and upregulation of genes involved in cell survival. The results indicate that metabolically stressed cows had reduced neutrophil function during the peripartum period, highlighting a potential relationship between subclinical metabolic disease and innate immune function that suggests that metabolic health negatively affects the innate immune system and may contribute to the state of immunosuppression during the peripartum period. In this way, the metabolic stress among the HR cows may reduce their ability to combat infection during the transition period.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mallory A.

e4463cf19f881f6e3d837fbed453014aed98de5c,Abstract LB-292: Race-associated gene expression in tumors and breast cancer mortality disparities,"Proceedings: AACR Annual Meeting 2014; April 5-9, 2014; San Diego, CA

Background: African American (AA) women have lower incidence, but higher mortality rates when they are diagnosed with breast cancer. Biological differences in tumor subtypes, with greater prevalence of aggressive basal-like breast cancers in AA women, explain some disparities; however, even when AA women are diagnosed with â€˜good prognosisâ€™ Luminal A breast cancers, they fare worse than Caucasian (Cau) women with the same subtype. Our goal was to identify disparity-associated gene expression in breast tumors overall, and in Luminal A breast cancers specifically.

Methods: Disparity-associated gene expression was defined as gene expression that was both strongly associated with patient race and with substantial differential in disease-free survival in Cau, defined as the hazard ratio (HR) > 1.25 or = median expression to those with < median expression. We used microarray data from 165 breast tumor samples (108 Cau and 57 AA women). This dataset included 68 Luminal A tumors and 39 Basal-like tumors. We identified race-associated gene expression using linear models with a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 5%. Genes that were differentially expressed by race in breast cancers overall or among luminal A tumors were tested for associations with survival. Genes that were both race- and survival-associated were further evaluated for race-related patterns of expression in normal reduction mammoplasty samples (N=100) and cancer-adjacent histologically normal (N=92) tissue.

Results: At an FDR = 5%, 10 genes were differentially expressed by race in Luminal A tumors. Six of these showed associations with survival [CRYBB2 (HR = 1.36), PSPH (HR = 1.65), ACOX2 (HR = 0.65), MUC1 (HR = 0.65), TYMS (HR = 2.67), SQLE (HR = 1.98)] in NKI295. Two distinct patterns emerged for the expression of these genes in normal tissue: CRYBB2 and PSPH were differentially expressed in tumor and normal tissue of AA compared to Cau women; ACOX2, MUC1, TYMS, SQLE were only differentially expressed in tumors. A composite expression score based on expression of all six genes, or including only CRYBB2/PSPH, was associated with tumor characteristics. Furthermore, composite expression was associated with survival across all tumors and Luminal A tumors in an independent dataset.

Discussion: These analyses replicated previously reported associations between CRYBB2 and PSPH expression in breast tumors and race, and extended the analysis to address normal tissue differences and survival among Luminal A tumors. These patterns in normal tissue suggest that CRYBB2 and PSPH expression could represent race-specific differences in susceptibility to aggressive tumors. Although disparities in luminal A breast cancer mortality may be related to treatment or access to care, these data suggest that biological differences between at-risk AA and Cau women may also be operating.

Understanding its biochemistry may allow insights into tumorigenesis. To that end we carried out RNA-Seq analyses of 5 SCC9 derived oral cancer cell lines displaying increased invasive potential. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were annotated based on p-values and false discovery rate (q-values). All 292 KEGG pathways related to the human genome were compared in order to pinpoint the absolute and relative contributions to the invasive process considering the 8 hallmarks of cancer plus 2 new defined categories, as well as we made with our transcriptomic data. In terms of absolute contribution, the highest correlations were associated to the categories of evading immune destruction and energy metabolism and for relative contributions, angiogenesis and evading immune destruction. DEGs were distributed into each one of all possible modes of regulation, regarding up, down and continuum expression, along the 3 stages of metastatic progression. For p-values twenty-six genes were consistently present along the tumoral progression and 4 for q-values. Among the DEGs, we found 2 novel potentially informative metastatic markers: PIGG and SLC8B1.

c2e89a2d2d1bed2311ed27ad235c8fa33c68bec2,Fatty Fish Intake Decreases Lipids Related to Inflammation and Insulin Signalingâ€”A Lipidomics Approach,"BACKGROUND
The evidence of the multiple beneficial health effects of fish consumption is strong, but physiological mechanisms behind these effects are not completely known. Little information is available on the effects of consumption of different type of fish. The aim of this study was to investigate how fatty fish or lean fish in a diet affect serum lipidomic profiles in subjects with coronary heart disease.


METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
A pilot study was designed which included altogether 33 subjects with myocardial infarction or unstable ischemic attack in an 8-week parallel controlled intervention. The subjects were randomized to either fatty fish (n = 11), lean fish (n = 12) or control (n = 10) groups. Subjects in the fish groups had 4 fish meals per week and subjects in the control group consumed lean beef, pork and chicken. A fish meal was allowed once a week maximum. Lipidomics analyses were performed using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and gas chromatography. Multiple bioactive lipid species, including ceramides, lysophosphatidylcholines and diacylglycerols, decreased significantly in the fatty fish group, whereas in the lean fish group cholesterol esters and specific long-chain triacylglycerols increased significantly (False Discovery Rate q-value <0.05).


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
The 8-week consumption of fatty fish decreased lipids which are potential mediators of lipid-induced insulin resistance and inflammation, and may be related to the protective effects of fatty fish on the progression of atherosclerotic vascular diseases or insulin resistance.

3522c23d90a28dce8298c79881927fae53d420a9,Gene expression changes in children with autism.,"The objective of this study was to identify gene expression differences in blood differences in children with autism (AU) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to general population controls. Transcriptional profiles were compared with age- and gender-matched, typically developing children from the general population (GP). The AU group was subdivided based on a history of developmental regression (A-R) or a history of early onset (A-E without regression). Total RNA from blood was processed on human Affymetrix microarrays. Thirty-five children with AU (17 with early onset autism and 18 with autism with regression) and 14 ASD children (who did not meet criteria for AU) were compared to 12 GP children. Unpaired t tests (corrected for multiple comparisons with a false discovery rate of 0.05) detected a number of genes that were regulated more than 1.5-fold for AU versus GP (n=55 genes), for A-E versus GP (n=140 genes), for A-R versus GP (n=20 genes), and for A-R versus A-E (n=494 genes). No genes were significantly regulated for ASD versus GP. There were 11 genes shared between the comparisons of all autism subgroups to GP (AU, A-E, and A-R versus GP) and these genes were all expressed in natural killer cells and many belonged to the KEGG natural killer cytotoxicity pathway (p=0.02). A subset of these genes (n=7) was tested with qRT-PCR and all genes were found to be differentially expressed (p<0.05). We conclude that the gene expression data support emerging evidence for abnormalities in peripheral blood leukocytes in autism that could represent a genetic and/or environmental predisposition to the disorder.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jeffrey P.

5cd42d3de2acd5a92b2d5de01b9405ee02ec78aa,Genome-wide estimation of gender differences in the gene expression of human livers: Statistical design and analysis,"BackgroundGender differences in gene expression were estimated in liver samples from 9 males and 9 females. The study tested 31,110 genes for a gender difference using a design that adjusted for sources of variation associated with cDNA arrays, normalization, hybridizations and processing conditions.ResultsThe genes were split into 2,800 that were clearly expressed (expressed genes) and 28,310 that had expression levels in the background range (not expressed genes). The distribution of p-values from the 'not expressed' group was consistent with no gender differences. The distribution of p-values from the 'expressed' group suggested that 8 % of these genes differed by gender, but the estimated fold-changes (expression in males / expression in females) were small. The largest observed fold-change was 1.55. The 95 % confidence bounds on the estimated fold-changes were less than 1.4 fold for 79.3 %, and few (1.1%) exceed 2-fold.ConclusionObserved gender differences in gene expression were small. When selecting genes with gender differences based upon their p-values, false discovery rates exceed 80 % for any set of genes, essentially making it impossible to identify any specific genes with a gender difference.",2005,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Robert R.

We hypothesized that gene expression profiles predictive of AC response may be different from our previously published patterns with docetaxel.MethodsCore biopsies from 40 patients were obtained before treatment with AC (6 cycles, 60/600Â mg/m2q3 weeks), and clinical responses recorded after treatment. Gene expression patterns were analyzed using Affymetrix U133A chips which comprise ~22,200 genes.ResultsClinical complete responses (cCR) were observed in 22, partial responses in 7, stable disease in 11 patients. Differential expression between sensitive cCR and resistant tumors with a low false discovery rate (<5%) was obtained. Of these 253 differentially expressed genes, pathways up-regulated in sensitive tumors included cell cycle (BUB3, CDKN1B), survival (BCL2, BAG1, BIRC1, STK39), stress response (CYP2B6, MAPK14), and estrogen-related pathways (ER, IRS1). Resistant tumors expressed gene promoting transcription (GTF3C1, ILF3), differentiation (ST14, CTNNBIP1), signal transduction (EIF1AX, EIF4EBP1), and amino acid metabolism (SRM, PLOD1, PLOD3). With leave-one-out cross validation, 67% of the samples were correctly classified, with a permutation p-value of 0.4. The previously published 92-gene molecular portrait for docetaxel sensitivity could not discriminate AC sensitivity and resistance.ConclusionsThis preliminary study supports that molecular profiles for AC response are likely to exist, with unique expression patterns for individual chemotherapy regimens. Larger validation studies are necessary to define and refine patterns for different agents.",2005,Medicine,"list(name = ""Susan Cleator"", ids = ""50476654""); list(name = ""Anna Tsimelzon"", ids = ""49073155""); list(name = ""Alan Ashworth"", ids = ""152430226""); list(name = ""Mitch Dowsett"", ids = ""73802467""); list(name = ""Timothy Dexter"", ids = ""50551057""); list(name = ""Trevor J.

Such regions are reasonable candidates for harboring disease genes. We find the asymptotic distribution of the statistic while accounting for correlations among sampled individuals. We then use the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method for multiple hypothesis testing to find regions of excess sharing. The p values for each region involve estimated nuisance parameters. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the FDR method based on p values and with estimated nuisance parameters asymptotically preserves the FDR property.

6a9ccc689857ea9c4ef583ea3319fe8211cb80d9,"'True' null allele detection in microsatellite loci: a comparison of methods, assessment of difficulties and survey of possible improvements.","Null alleles are alleles that for various reasons fail to amplify in a PCR assay. The presence of null alleles in microsatellite data is known to bias the genetic parameter estimates. Thus, efficient detection of null alleles is crucial, but the methods available for indirect null allele detection return inconsistent results. Here, our aim was to compare different methods for null allele detection, to explain their respective performance and to provide improvements. We applied several approaches to identify the 'true' null alleles based on the predictions made by five different methods, used either individually or in combination. First, we introduced simulated 'true' null alleles into 240 population data sets and applied the methods to measure their success in detecting the simulated null alleles. The single best-performing method was ML-NullFreq_frequency. Furthermore, we applied different noise reduction approaches to improve the results. For instance, by combining the results of several methods, we obtained more reliable results than using a single one. Rule-based classification was applied to identify population properties linked to the false discovery rate. Rules obtained from the classifier described which population genetic estimates and loci characteristics were linked to the success of each method. We have shown that by simulating 'true' null alleles into a population data set, we may define a null allele frequency threshold, related to a desired true or false discovery rate. Moreover, using such simulated data sets, the expected null allele homozygote frequency may be estimated independently of the equilibrium state of the population.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""M.

Differential analysis was performed with package edgeR. False discovery rate (FDR) 1 were set as cut-off values to screen out differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene coexpression network was constructed with package Ebcoexpress. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was performed for the DEGs in the gene coexpression network with DAVID online tool. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis was also performed for the genes with KOBASS 2.0.A total of 620 DEGs, 389 up-regulated genes, and 231 down-regulated genes, were identified from 163 READ samples and 9 normal controls. A gene coexpression network consisting of 71 DEGs and 253 edges were constructed. Genes were associated with ribosome and focal adhesion functions. Three modules were identified, in which genes were involved in muscle contraction, negative regulation of glial cell proliferation and extracellular matrix organization functions, respectively. Several critical hub genes were disclosed, such as RPS2, MMP1, MMP11 and FAM83H. Thirteen relevant small molecule drugs were identified, such as scriptaid and spaglumic acid. A total of 8 TFs and 5 miRNAs were acquired, such as MYC, NFY, STAT5A, miR-29, miR-200 and miR-19.Several critical genes and relevant drugs, TFs and miRNAs were revealed in READ. These findings could advance the understanding about the disease and benefit therapy development.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Zuo Zg"", ids = ""83272269""); list(name = ""Zhang Xf"", ids = ""66549302""); list(name = ""Ye Xz"", ids = ""83348083""); list(name = ""Zhou Zh"", ids = ""66566801""); list(name = ""Wu Xb"", ids = ""66712269""); list(name = ""Ni Sc"", ids = ""152303403""); list(name = ""Song Hy"", ids = ""74721634"")",,,European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences,20,3017-3025
f8fab450f0b201b0833f2693831969b57ab8f2ac,Improvement of Structure Conservation Index with Centroid Estimators,"RNAz, a support vector machine (SVM) approach for identifying functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), has been proven to be one of the most accurate tools for this goal. Among the measurements used in RNAz, the Structure Conservation Index (SCI) which evaluates the evolutionary conservation of RNA secondary structures in terms of folding energies, has been reported to have an extremely high discrimination capability. However, for practical use of RNAz on the genome-wide search, a relatively high false discovery rate has unfortunately been estimated. It is conceivable that multiple alignments produced by a standard aligner that does not consider any secondary structures are not suitable for identifying ncRNAs in some cases and incur high false discovery rate. In this study, we propose C-SCI, an improved measurement based on the SCI applying gamma-centroid estimators to incorporate the robustness against low quality multiple alignments. Our experiments show that the C-SCI achieves higher accuracy than the original SCI for not only human-curated structural alignments but also low quality alignments produced by CLUSTAL W. Furthermore, the accuracy of the C-SCI on CLUSTAL W alignments is comparable with that of the original SCI on structural alignments generated with RAF for which 4.7-fold expensive computational time is required on average.",2010,Computer Science; Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yohei Okada"", ids = ""49472046""); list(name = ""Kengo Sato"", ids = ""51311844""); list(name = ""Yasubumi Sakakibara"", ids = ""1705051"")",5c7060f3753d90ca07019941ae52e1a872158bbf; 0705a109181fb5f604fc93a21b73215af5bd40de; 092ce245c6579183cff43312e62fed988694d41f; c7e3c93021b93369c88811ce04e978861177e1dc; 8d903e5bc084ff20b9ae7f5f081e747092ab0966,0204ff68404a0d6b4603b8f32460b66d67d9b2e1; 4426b5271869d6436da107a455af7a44cb888fe8; 4246613a89c19dbd326eee6cbadf6a933de21eb9; 8c17b89bb49201fc3460477e59fc1d1db99b3a08,Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

Genome-wide association studies have identified several genomic regions that are associated with breast cancer risk, but these provide an explanation for only a small fraction of familial breast cancer aggregation. Genotype by environment interactions may contribute further to such explanation, and may help to refine the genomic regions of interest.


METHODS
We examined genotypes for 4,988 SNPs, selected from recent genome-wide studies, and four randomized hormonal and dietary interventions among 2,166 women who developed invasive breast cancer during the intervention phase of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial (1993 to 2005), and one-to-one matched controls. These SNPs derive from 3,224 genomic regions having pairwise squared correlation (r2) between adjacent regions less than 0.2. Breast cancer and SNP associations were identified using a test statistic that combined evidence of overall association with evidence for SNPs by intervention interaction.


RESULTS
The combined 'main effect' and interaction test led to a focus on two genomic regions, the fibroblast growth factor receptor two (FGFR2) and the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S30 (MRPS30) regions. The ranking of SNPs by significance level, based on this combined test, was rather different from that based on the main effect alone, and drew attention to the vicinities of rs3750817 in FGFR2 and rs7705343 in MRPS30. Specifically, rs7705343 was included with several FGFR2 SNPs in a group of SNPs having an estimated false discovery rate < 0.05. In further analyses, there were suggestions (nominal P < 0.05) that hormonal and dietary intervention hazard ratios varied with the number of minor alleles of rs7705343.


CONCLUSIONS
Genotype by environment interaction information may help to define genomic regions relevant to disease risk. Combined main effect and intervention interaction analyses raise novel hypotheses concerning the MRPS30 genomic region and the effects of hormonal and dietary exposures on postmenopausal breast cancer risk.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ying Huang"", ids = ""46844613""); list(name = ""Dennis G.

However, the mode by which genetic variation results in phenotypic change remains largely unknown, with many associated polymorphisms likely to modulate gene expression. Analyses of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) to date indicate that as many as 50% of these are tissue specific. Here we report a comprehensive eQTL scan of intestinal tissue. Methods: Patients who had undergone ileal pouch anal anastomosis and closure of ileostomy at least one year prior to recruitment were prospectively enrolled at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. Ileal tissue biopsies predominantly normal on endoscopy and histology from the afferent limb of these individuals were obtained and preserved in RNAlater. Total RNA was extracted with the QIAGEN miRNeasy Kit and mRNA analysis was performed on Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. DNA was obtained from whole-blood samples from the same individuals and genotyped using the Illumina Human OmniExpress platform. Preliminary cis-eQTL analysis (Â±50Kb around each gene) was carried out on 169 subjects encompassing the expression levels of 19,047 unique autosomal genes listed in the NCBI database and 565,802 dbSNPs (Call Rate â‰¥ 95%; MAF â‰¥ 5%; HardyWeinberg Ï‡2 â‰¤ 6.635). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare expression values across different genotypes and Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied at an alpha level of 5%. Results: The presence of 3,074 statistically significant cis-eQTLs associated with 575 genes was detected with this analysis. eQTLs associated with the same expression trait were in high linkage disequilibrium. 230 (40%) of these 575 genes have been reported as quantitative traits in liver tissue by a prior study using similar methodology. After false discovery rate correction for multiple testing, our analysis confirmed previously published cis-eQTLs that are also IBD associated SNPs: rs2298428/UBE2L3, rs1050152/SLC22A4 and rs2631372/SLC22A5. Conversely, the majority of significant cis-eQTLs are novel and possibly tissue specific. These pertain to many aspects of cellular function from division to antigen processing and presentation. Conclusion: eQTL analysis of intestinal tissue substantiates reports in the literature that some eQTLs remain stable across cell types while many others are specific to the sampled location. Our findings not only confirm, but also significantly expand the number of known genotypes associated with expression and could help elucidate the mechanisms of intestinal disease.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Michelle Vu"", ids = ""47707597""); list(name = ""Dalin Li"", ids = ""2325089""); list(name = ""Marla Dubinsky"", ids = ""50761010""); list(name = ""Kent D.

06a9ec1d0e6ce7f125bb981653da33b3e4e39185,Genome-Wide Search for Splicing Defects Associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the degeneration of motor neurons. Although the cause of ALS is unknown,Â Â mutations in the gene that produces the SOD1 enzyme are associated with some cases of familial ALS. SOD1 is a powerful antioxidant that protects the body from damage caused by superoxide, a toxic free radical. It has been proposed that defects in splicing of some mRNAs, induced by oxidative stress, can play a role in ALS pathogenesis. Alterations of splicing patterns have also been observed in ALS patients and in ALS murine models, suggesting that alterations in the splicing events can contribute to ALS progression. Using Exon 1.0 ST GeneChips, which allow the definition of alternative splicing events (ASEs) , the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line has been profiled after treatment with paraquat, which by inducing oxidative stress alters the patterns of alternative splicing. Furthermore, the same cell line stably transfected with wt and ALS mutant SOD has also been profiled. The integration of the two ALS models efficiently moderates ASE false discovery rate,Â Â one of the most critical issues in high-throughput ASEs detection. This approach allowed the identification of a total of 14 splicing events affecting respectively both internal coding exons and 5' UTR of known gene isoforms.",2009,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Silvia C.

67924ca8444cca76708b03f17624597e65a96879,Identification of a molecular subtyping system associated with the prognosis of Asian hepatocellular carcinoma patients receiving liver resection,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a severe health issue worldwide, especially in Asia. To date, molecular classifications proposed for the overall survival (OS) or recurrence-free survival (RFS) prediction of Asian HCC patients after hepatectomy are quite few and limited in clinical practice. Here, we established a molecular subtyping system for Asian HCC to facilitate prognosis evaluation. Firstly, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR [false discovery rate] <0.05) between different types of liver cancer and non-tumor tissue were screened. Among the DEGs solely between HCC and non-tumor samples, 185 genes simultaneously significantly associated with the OS and RFS were identified as HCC-characteristic genes. The molecular subtypes were developed based on the expression profiles of the 185 genes in the training dataset (TCGA [The Cancer Genome Atlas] dataset) using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering method. Patients were then classified into Subtype1 and Subtype2 groups denoting unfavorable and favorable clinical outcome respectively. The robustness and effectiveness of the molecular subtype was confirmed in another independent dataset (GSE14520) by the same clustering approach and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Moreover, functional prediction analysis revealed that the identified molecular signature was involved in chemotaxis, apoptosis and cell development associated pathways. Besides, the molecular signature was closely related to the clinical characteristics including TNM stage, preoperative alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level and TP53 mutation. Furthermore, integration of the molecular subtype and TNM stage was demonstrated to improve risk stratification. Taken together, our molecular subtyping system exhibited great utility and potential in prognosis prediction and therapeutic decision making of Asian HCC patients.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaohua Ma"", ids = ""47065982""); list(name = ""Jingxian Gu"", ids = ""2231116""); list(name = ""Kun Wang"", ids = ""51200979""); list(name = ""Xing Zhang"", ids = ""145969224""); list(name = ""Juan Bai"", ids = ""144597303""); list(name = ""Jingyao Zhang"", ids = ""2173821""); list(name = ""Chang Liu"", ids = ""49046681""); list(name = ""Qiang Qiu"", ids = ""50088802""); list(name = ""Kai Qu"", ids = ""18116850"")",,2f3c851447d3b6e2810fc4931fc23bdbefd57521; b662ad2509f714dbedc24fdcec00d095e1b4b44c; 38499e99c1ae8b9770e67206bd092affec2dd5b8; 255f1e36f78597e469a046e5fb6ede60e43ab3e6; 85d52cd99305b74c70ce0902b16f2232d5c59914; 29bae9472203546847ec1352a604566d0f602728; 94255f80d0cdf12f53df58929861a102041cc393; 9ce6b5b9b6cf934a4ae3770e085d40888465aad0; b54018573351b8b560f0540a584bc11b8d4f4d06; cd8c4ccb566ffbdb034d2f9430dbfb2fd6fdd5fe; 4e78cccf0e02d937f45dab8adb9d26cb34e459f9; e18a4a356fcfbd3f6adb1fa4ee23bb5d0920c307; 8e9d6f6742e254ca6a7b4fa27891cb37000a7517; ef067ccec4bcfbe128a374074ed6e1e5ddf5eb3c; 4eec53d6b282b9d723cc6885fff331581c8c2de6,Scientific Reports,9,

To identify gestational diabetes mellitus exposure-associated DNA methylation changes and assess whether such changes are also associated with adiposity-related outcomes.


METHODS
We performed an epigenome-wide association analysis, using Illumina 450k methylation arrays, on whole blood collected, on average, at 10.5 years of age from 81 gestational diabetes-exposed and 81 unexposed offspring enrolled in the EPOCH (Exploring Perinatal Outcomes in Children) study, and on the cord blood of 31 gestational diabetes-exposed and 64 unexposed offspring enrolled in the Colorado Healthy Start cohort. Validation was performed by pyrosequencing.


RESULTS
We identified 98 differentially methylated positions associated with gestational diabetes exposure at a false discovery rate of <10% in peripheral blood, with 51 loci remaining significant (plus additional 40 loci) after adjustment for cell proportions. We also identified 2195 differentially methylation regions at a false discovery rate of <5% after adjustment for cell proportions. We prioritized loci for pyrosequencing validation and association analysis with adiposity-related outcomes based on strengths of association and effect size, network and pathway analysis, analysis of cord blood, and previous publications. Methylation in six out of nine (67%) gestational diabetes-associated genes was validated and we also showed that methylation of SH3PXD2A was significantly (P<0.05) associated with multiple adiposity-related outcomes.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that epigenetic marks may provide an important link between in utero exposure to gestational diabetes and obesity in childhood, and add to the growing body of evidence that DNA methylation is affectedÂ by gestational diabetes exposure.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ivana V.

f822d9a7512b3cbb1c986aa7a160d6b731bdbd02,Submitted to the Annals of Statistics ROBUST INFERENCE WITH KNOCKOFFS By Rina,"We consider the variable selection problem, which seeks to identify important variables influencing a response Y out of many candidate features X1, . . . , Xp. We wish to do so while offering finite-sample guarantees about the fraction of false positivesâ€”selected variables Xj that in fact have no effect on Y after the other features are known. When the number of features p is large (perhaps even larger than the sample size n), and we have no prior knowledge regarding the type of dependence between Y and X, the model-X knockoffs framework nonetheless allows us to select a model with a guaranteed bound on the false discovery rate, as long as the distribution of the feature vector X = (X1, . . . , Xp) is exactly known. This model selection procedure operates by constructing â€œknockoff copiesâ€ of each of the p features, which are then used as a control group to ensure that the model selection algorithm is not choosing too many irrelevant features. In this work, we study the practical setting where the distribution of X can only be estimated, rather than known exactly, and the knockoff copies of the Xj â€™s are therefore constructed somewhat incorrectly. Our results, which are free of any modeling assumption whatsoever, show that the resulting model selection procedure incurs an inflation of the false discovery rate that is proportional to our errors in estimating the distribution of each feature Xj conditional on the remaining features {Xk : k 6= j}. The model-X knockoffs framework is therefore robust to errors in the underlying assumptions on the distribution of X, making it an effective method for many practical applications, such as genome-wide association studies, where the underlying distribution on the features X1, . . . , Xp is estimated accurately but not known exactly.",2019,,"list(name = ""Foygel Barber"", ids = list()); list(name = ""Emmanuel J.

It is also a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Non-synonymous (ns) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported to contribute to genetic susceptibility in both monogenic disorders and common complex diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate whether nsSNPs are involved in susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy using a case-control design.MethodsWhite type 1 diabetic patients with (cases) and without (controls) nephropathy from eight centres in the UK and Ireland were genotyped for a selected subset of nsSNPs using Illuminaâ€™s GoldenGate BeadArray assay. A Ï‡2 test for trend, stratified by centre, was used to assess differences in genotype distribution between cases and controls. Genomic control was used to adjust for possible inflation of test statistics, and the False Discovery Rate method was used to account for multiple testing.ResultsWe assessed 1,111 nsSNPs for association with diabetic nephropathy in 1,711 individuals with type 1 diabetes (894 cases, 817 controls). A number of SNPs demonstrated a significant difference in genotype distribution between groups before but not after correction for multiple testing. Furthermore, neither subgroup analysis (diabetic nephropathy with ESRD or diabetic nephropathy without ESRD) nor stratification by duration of diabetes revealed any significant differences between groups.Conclusions/interpretationThe nsSNPs investigated in this study do not appear to contribute significantly to the development of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""David A.

We investigated the molecular and cellular responses of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GBM-SCs) to all-trans retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation. Four GBM-SC lines were used. Under neurosphere culture conditions, GBM-SCs grow as non-adherent neurospheres. RA (10 Î¼mol/l) treatment for 48 h induced cells to adhere to culture surfaces and generate processes. RA inhibited G1/G0 to S transition, decreased cyclin D1 expression (50%) and increased p27 expression (2-fold). Immunofluorescence staining, western blot and flow cytometry analyses showed that RA induced the expression of differentiation markers Tuj1 and GFAP and inhibited nestin expression. RA treatment reduced the number of cells expressing CD133 from 44% to 10%. We measured the effects of RA on neurosphere number and size. RA treatment dramatically decreased (âˆ¼90%) the number of neurospheres > 50 um diameter. Clonogenic assay showed that RA reduced the colony formation ability of GBM-SCs in soft agar. Microarray analysis was performed to determine the global gene expression profile of RA-induced GBM-SC differentiation. Data were analyzed using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and the false discovery rate was set at 20%. Approximately 350 genes were altered after RA treatment for 48h; âˆ¼20% were down-regulated and 80% were up-regulated. We selected 18 candidates and validated with real-time PCR. All 18 candidates exhibited the same pattern of up- or down-regulation by RA. Western blot analysis for some candidate gene products also confirmed the alteration by RA at the protein level. A web-based (portal.genego.com) molecular pathway analysis of RA-induced gene expression profiling identified several pathways altered during RA-induced differentiation process. The most prominent of them was Notch signaling. Notch pathway members Delta-like 1 (DLL1), Notch 1, NCID, NEXT and Notch 1 precursor were found to be down-regulated by RA. Only Delta-like 4 (DLL4) was up-regulated by RA. We also found that cyclin D, cyclin D1, PP2A and SMAD3, gene products involved in G1-S transition, were down-regulated by RA. This is consistence with our findings that RA induces cell cycle arrest. Numerous mechanisms involved in cell adhesion, cell-matrix interaction and cytoskeleton remodeling were also affected by RA. This analysis provides guidelines to further explore pathways and mechanisms during RA-induced GBM-SC differentiation. Our findings may be applicable to identify new molecular target applicable to differentiation therapies for glioblastomas. This will also stimulate the development of GBM stem cell based pre-clinical experimental models with the potential to improve mechanistic and pre-clinical therapeutic research.

Refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) represents one subtype of the myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by apoptosis of erythroid precursors and accumulation of aberrant mitochondrial ferritin. Gene expression profiling (GEP) has revealed significant dysregulation of genes involved in iron transport and mitochondrial and erythroid function (Nikpour et al, 2010) but no specific mutations have been identified. Generally, dysregulation increases with forced differentiation indicating alterations of underlying transcription factors. To further explore the molecular mechanisms in RARS, we examined the transcriptional profile associated with early erythroid maturation in NBM and RARS using RNA-Seq. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a novel method to analyze the full transcriptional activity of a cell or tissue. Expression levels of specific genes, differential splicing, allele-specific expression of transcripts can be accurately determined by RNA-Seq experiments to address many biological-related issues.

Bone marrow aspirates were collected from a patient and a control and subjected to CD34+ separation. Cells were cultured for 4 days to allow for erythroid maturation. cDNA libraries were prepared from RNA extracted from these two time points (0 and 4 days), and thereafter sequenced on Life Technology's next generation sequencing platform SOLiD. Approximately 80 million reads were obtained for each library (see [Table 1][1]). Two sets of analyses were made; one blinded for position (PU) to allow for an unbiased analysis of data and one (MN) comparing position profiles with raised previous GEP findings.

Read mapping summary



Reads were mapped to the human genome reference sequence (NCBI build version GRCh37) using the bowtie alignment program. To minimize expression level bias through the misclassification of transcripts, only uniquely mapping reads were retained for downstream analysis. Between 14 and 16 million uniquely mapping reads were obtained for each library.

Gene models were defined on the genome based on annotations in the ensemble genome database release 58. Reads were associated with a gene if it overlapped any part of a gene, including introns. Furthermore, overlapping genes were removed, ensuring unique read-gene association. 38926 gene models were used in the analysis. Raw gene expression counts for each gene model were obtained as the number of reads that overlapped that gene model. Between 7 and 10 million reads were retained for further analysis.

Differential gene expression analysis was done using the bioconductor package DESeq. We compared samples pairwise using a negative binomial statistical model to assess significant differential expression. We corrected for multiple testing using a false discovery rate of 0.1. The number of differentially expressed genes ranged from 10 (comparison Control D4-RARS D4) to 294 (comparison Control CD34+-RARS CD34+). Due to the lack of replicates, variance estimates are uncertain, leading to a lower number of inferred differentially expressed genes. Based on correlation of gene expression and the number of differentially expressed genes, samples could be clustered into two pairs, Control CD34+-RARS CD34+ and Control D4-RARS D4.

In order to infer potential functional differences between the samples, we analyzed the function of the differentially expressed genes and performed gene category overrepresentation analysis, using the gene ontology classification system. Interestingly, several non-coding RNAs involved in eg miRNA processing were significantly down-regulated in both RARS positions, compared to NBM. We also identified dramatic dysregulation of two putative zinc finger transcription factors during erythroid differentiation.

We conclude that high-quality transcriptome analysis at different time points during erythroid maturation is able to add significant new information to conventional gene expression profiling, which will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of RARS.

f51d432ac483b272f952a9d72a838b35ca28c16a,Acute milk yield response to frequent milking during early lactation is mediated by genes transiently regulated by milk removal.,"Milking dairy cows four times daily (4Ã—) instead of twice daily (2Ã—) during early lactation stimulates an increase in milk yield that partly persists through late lactation; however, the mechanisms behind this response are unknown. We hypothesized that the acute mammary response to regular milkings would be transient and would involve different genes from those that may be specifically regulated in response to 4Ã—. Nine multiparous cows were assigned at parturition to unilateral frequent milking (UFM; 2Ã— of the left udder half, 4Ã— of the right udder half). Mammary biopsies were obtained from both rear quarters at 5 days in milk (DIM), immediately after 4Ã— glands had been milked (experiment 1, n = 4 cows), or 2.5 h after both udder halves had last been milked (experiment 2, n = 5 cows). Affymetrix GeneChip Bovine Genome Arrays were used to measure gene expression. We found 855 genes were differentially expressed in mammary tissue between 2Ã— vs. 4Ã— glands of cows in experiment 1 (false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05), whereas none were differentially expressed in experiment 2 using the same criterion. We conclude that there is an acute transcriptional response to milk removal, but 4Ã— milking did not elicit differential expression of unique genes. Therefore, there does not appear to be a sustained transcriptional response to 4Ã— milking on day 5 of lactation. Using a differential expression plot of data from both experiments, as well as qRT-PCR, we identified at least two genes (chitinase 3-like-1 and low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 that may be responsive to both milk removal and to 4Ã— milking. Therefore, the milk yield response to 4Ã— milking may be mediated by genes that are acutely regulated by removal of milk from the mammary gland.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Emma H.

Compared to the existing methods depending on regularization technique, the proposed method avoids the ambiguous relationship between the regularized parameter and the number of false edges in graph estimation. It is proved that the proposed procedure can control the false discovery rate (FDR) asymptotically. Besides theoretical analysis, thorough numerical simulations are conducted to compare the graph estimation performance of the proposed method with some other state-of-the-art methods.

To investigate the gene expression profile in patients with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome that is characterized by different clinical phenotypes.


Methods
RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was purified in 8 patients with glandular features (GFs) and widespread pain (WP) and 11 with extraglandular manifestations (EGMs) and then was analyzed by hybridization on a human gene chip exploring more than 40,000 human genes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the two subgroups (ie, those with false discovery rate-corrected P values â‰¤ 0.01) with respect to 20 healthy controls have been submitted to functional classification using a Gene Ontology database and were mapped to define the networks of protein to protein interactions (PPIs).


Results
The enriched pathway analyses of DEGs and of the highly interconnected modules identified in the PPI networks showed that the pathological processes characterizing the two subgroups were substantially different. The predominant pathways in patients with EGMs are related to T- and B-cell activation, Toll-like receptor, interferon signaling, and apoptosis. Conversely, pathological processes related to pain transmission and modulation are preferentially operative in patients with GFs and WP. These data suggest that a neuroinflammatory pathway driven by cytokines and chemokines may play a central role in triggering WP features in this phenotype of patients.


Conclusion
The present study supports the hypothesis that different biological pathways are operative in patients with primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome with different clinical phenotypes. A better knowledge of these specific processes might help in tailoring more effective target therapies.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Claudio Vitali"", ids = ""144511290""); list(name = ""Marzia Dolcino"", ids = ""4471526""); list(name = ""Nicoletta Del Papa"", ids = ""49350201""); list(name = ""Antonina Minniti"", ids = ""153313113""); list(name = ""Francesca Pignataro"", ids = ""37350350""); list(name = ""Wanda Maglione"", ids = ""7817269""); list(name = ""Claudio Lunardi"", ids = ""49961581""); list(name = ""Antonio Puccetti"", ids = ""2299390"")",,,ACR Open Rheumatology,1,603 - 613

In this study, we compared whole transcript microarray expression profiles of a BRAF mutant, brain metastasis from a PTC, including its technical replicate (TR), with eight non-brain metastatic PTCs and eight primary brain tumors. The top 95 probe sets (false discovery rate (FDR) p-value < 0.05 and fold change (FC) > 2) that were differentially expressed between the brain metastatic PTC, including the TR, and both, non-brain metastatic PTCs and primary brain tumors were in the vast majority upregulated and comprise, e.g. ROS1, MYBPH, SLC18A3, HP, SAA2-SAA4, CP, CCL20, GFAP, RNU1-120P, DMBT1, XDH, CXCL1, PI3, and NAPSA. Cytokines were represented by 10 members in the top 95 probe sets. Pathway and network analysis (p-value < 0.05 and FC > 2) identified granulocytes adhesion and diapedesis as top canonical pathway. Most significant upstream regulators were lipopolysaccharide, TNF, NKkB (complex), IL1A, and CSF2. Top networks categorized under diseases & functions were entitled migration of cells, cell movement, cell survival, apoptosis, and proliferation of cells. Probe sets that were significantly shared between the brain metastatic PTC, the TR, and primary brain tumors include CASP1, CASP4, C1R, CC2D2B, RNY1P16, WDR72, LRRC2, ZHX2, CITED1, and the noncoding transcript AK128523.

398f0066c0ed79eabc46b7ddc77bb1b9deedadf6,Association between CASP7 and CASP14 genetic polymorphisms and the risk of childhood leukemia.,"Current evidence suggests that apoptosis and the cell cycle system play an important role in cancer development. To identify susceptible genetic markers in these mechanisms, we did an association study in 63 patients and 148 controls. A total of 304 SNPs in 31 gene regions were selected. We evaluated an association at a gene region level by computing the minimum P-value (minP) and doing the false discovery rate (FDR) test. Both SNP and gene-based analyses presented associations with the risk of childhood leukemia for 5 genes: CASP7, CASP14, CASP8AP2, MYC, and RIPK1 (P(trend)<0.05). There were statistically significant associations for CASP7 (rs12416109 and rs3814231, P(trend) = 0.002 and 0.009, respectively, minP = 0.013, FDR = 0.042) and CASP14 (rs8110862, P(trend)<0.001, minP = 0.002, FDR = 0.027).

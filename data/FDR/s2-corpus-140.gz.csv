6b68ed9783fb604494a32f76d6d13ee0089cd6cd,Association between DNA methylation profiles in leukocytes and serum levels of persistent organic pollutants in Dutch men,"Consumption of polluted fish may lead to high levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in humans, potentially causing adverse health effects. Altered DNA methylation has been suggested as a possible contributor to a variety of adverse health effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between serum POP levels (dioxins, polychlorobiphenyls, and perfluoroctane sulphonate) and DNA methylation. We recruited a total of 80 Dutch men who regularly consumed eel from either low- or high-polluted areas, and subsequently had normal or elevated POP levels. Clinical parameters related to e.g. hormone levels and liver enzymes were measured as biomarkers for adverse health effects. The Infinium 450K BeadChip was used to assess DNA methylation in a representative subset of 34 men. We identified multiple genes with differentially methylated regions (DMRs; false discovery rateâ€‰<0.05) related to POP levels. Several of these genes are involved in carcinogenesis (e.g. BRCA1, MAGEE2, HOXA5), the immune system (e.g. RNF39, HLA-DQB1), retinol homeostasis (DHRS4L2), or in metabolism (CYP1A1). The DMRs in these genes show mean methylation differences up to 7.4% when comparing low- and high-exposed men, with a mean difference up to 14.4% for single positions within a DMR. Clinical parameters were not significantly associated with serum POP levels. This is the first explorative study investigating extensive DNA methylation in relation to serum POP levels among men. We observed that elevated POP levels are associated with aberrant DNA methylation profiles in adult men who consumed high-polluted eel. These preliminary findings warrant further confirmation in other populations.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Myrthe W van den Dungen"", ids = ""3871305""); list(name = ""Albertinka Jacoba Murk"", ids = ""2437842""); list(name = ""Ellen Kampman"", ids = ""5043460""); list(name = ""W.

66f31c5781e8d77139bde2d30cde4b4a8c925ae6,Exploring the false discovery rate in multichannel NIRS,"Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), an emerging non-invasive tool for functional neuroimaging, has evolved as a multichannel technique allowing simultaneous measurements through many channels ranging from below ten to above hundred. Simultaneous testing of such a large number of channels escalates the risk of Type I error, therefore multiplicity correction is unavoidable. To date, only a few studies have considered this issue using Bonferroni correction, which is an effective conservative solution, but may be too severe for neuroimaging. Its power varies in inverse proportion of the number of channels, which varies among NIRS studies depending on selected region of interest (ROI), thereby leading to a subjective inference. This problem may be well circumvented by a more contemporary approach, called false discovery rate (FDR) that is widely being adopted in functional neuroimaging. An FDR-based procedure controls the expected proportion of erroneously rejected hypotheses among the rejected hypotheses, which offers a more objective, powerful, and consistent measure of Type I error than Bonferroni correction and maintains a better balance between power and specificity. In this technical note, we examine FDR approach using examples from simulated and real NIRS data. The FDR-based procedure could yield 52% more power than Bonferroni correction in a 172-channel real NIRS study and proved to be more robust against the changing number of channels.",2006,Mathematics; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Archana K.

7428061f7ef8330fdcfd20777850cc2a4aa56768,Gene variants associated with ischemic stroke: the cardiovascular health study.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
The purpose of this study was to determine whether 74 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which had been associated with coronary heart disease, are associated with incident ischemic stroke.


METHODS
Based on antecedent studies of coronary heart disease, we prespecified the risk allele for each of the 74 SNPs. We used Cox proportional hazards models that adjusted for traditional risk factors to estimate the associations of these SNPs with incident ischemic stroke during 14 years of follow-up in a population-based study of older adults: the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS).


RESULTS
In white CHS participants, the prespecified risk alleles of 7 of the 74 SNPs (in HPS1, ITGAE, ABCG2, MYH15, FSTL4, CALM1, and BAT2) were nominally associated with increased risk of stroke (one-sided P<0.05, false discovery rate=0.42). In black participants, the prespecified risk alleles of 5 SNPs (in KRT4, LY6G5B, EDG1, DMXL2, and ABCG2) were nominally associated with stroke (one-sided P<0.05, false discovery rate=0.55). The Val12Met SNP in ABCG2 was associated with stroke in both white (hazard ratio, 1.46; 90% CI, 1.05 to 2.03) and black (hazard ratio, 3.59; 90% CI, 1.11 to 11.6) participants of CHS. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 10-year cumulative incidence of stroke were greater among Val allele homozygotes than among Met allele carriers in both white (10% versus 6%) and black (12% versus 3%) participants of CHS.


CONCLUSIONS
The Val12Met SNP in ABCG2 (encoding a transporter of sterols and xenobiotics) was associated with incident ischemic stroke in white and black participants of CHS.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""May M.

To determine the association between bisphosphonate treatment with the change of periarticular bone area and three-dimensional (3D) shape in participants of the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) study.


DESIGN
Using propensity score (PS) matching method in females, 48 bisphosphonate users and 105 non-users, who were matched for osteoarthritis (OA) and osteoporosis (OP) related factors were included. Baseline and 24-month magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based periarticular bone area and 3D shape measurements were used. The association between bisphosphonate intake and 24-month interval changes of the periarticular bone area and 3D shape were evaluated using paired Wilcoxon signed rank test. We used conditional logistic regression models for determining the association between bisphosphonate intake and periarticular bone change, defined using the standard deviation of difference (SDD) and reliable change index (RCI) methods. P-values have been adjusted for multiple comparisons using Benjamini & Hochberg procedure and false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P-values were reported.


RESULTS
The 24-month interval increases in the periarticular bone area in medial side of tibia were significantly greater in non-users than users (FDR-adjusted P-value: 0.002). There was an approaching significance trend for lower medial tibial periarticular bone area expansion in bisphosphonate users in comparison with non-users (For 1SDD change, odds ratio 95% confidence interval (OR (95% CI)): 0.514 (0.271-0.975), FDR-adjusted P-value: 0.085) (For 1.96RCI change, OR (95% CI): 0.552 (0.309-0.986), FDR-adjusted P-value: 0.085).


CONCLUSIONS
Bisphosphonate intake was associated with a reduction in the odds (approaching but not achieving significance) of expansion periarticular bone area, specifically in the medial tibial sub-region.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Arya Haj-Mirzaian"", ids = ""1390023066""); list(name = ""Ali Guermazi"", ids = ""4399109""); list(name = ""Frank W.

7faa8e55497a4edce65b65c9b596f359fa1ab13e,High density methylation QTL analysis in human blood via next-generation sequencing of the methylated genomic DNA fraction,"BackgroundGenetic influence on DNA methylation is potentially an important mechanism affecting individual differences in humans. We use next-generation sequencing to assay blood DNA methylation at approximately 4.5 million loci, each comprising 2.9 CpGs on average, in 697 normal subjects. Methylation measures at each locus are tested for association with approximately 4.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to exhaustively screen for methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs).ResultsUsing stringent false discovery rate control, 15Â % of methylation sites show genetic influence. Most meQTLs are local, where the associated SNP and methylation site are in close genomic proximity. Distant meQTLs and those spanning different chromosomes are less common. Most local meQTLs encompass common SNPs that alter CpG sites (CpG-SNPs). Local meQTLs encompassing CpG-SNPs are enriched in regions of inactive chromatin in blood cells. In contrast, local meQTLs lacking CpG-SNPs are enriched in regions of active chromatin and transcription factor binding sites. Of 393 local meQTLs that overlap disease-associated regions from genome-wide studies, a high percentage encompass common CpG-SNPs. These meQTLs overlap active enhancers, differentiating them from CpG-SNP meQTLs in inactive chromatin.ConclusionsGenetic influence on the human blood methylome is common, involves several heterogeneous processes and is predominantly dependent on local sequence context at the meQTL site. Most meQTLs involve CpG-SNPs, while sequence-dependent effects on chromatin binding are also important in regions of active chromatin. An abundance of local meQTLs resulting from methylation of CpG-SNPs in inactive chromatin suggests that many meQTLs lack functional consequence.

c3223e774539f73407e4bf143a780edcac1688d2,Association Between Chronic Pulmonary Conditions and Neurocognitive Function in Long-Term Survivors of Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma,"Introduction: Literature suggests that long-term survivors of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) may be at risk for neurocognitive impairment. This study compared neurocognitive function in long-term survivors of HL to community controls and examined associations with pulmonary and cardiovascular morbidity. Methods: 158 HL survivors treated with thoracic radiation (RT) (mean[SD] age 37.7 [7.8] years, 23.4 [8.1] years post-diagnosis) and 164 age- and sex-matched community controls completed neurocognitive testing. Neurocognitive scores were converted into age-adjusted Z-scores (Î¼=0, Ïƒ=1.0) using national normative data and groups were compared across all measures, adjusting for false discovery rate. Systematic grading of pulmonary (obstructive, restrictive and/or diffusion deficits based on pulmonary function tests) and cardiovascular (structural, functional defects and/or arrhythmias based on electrocardiogram and echocardiogram) conditions was conducted using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.03. Presence of pulmonary and cardiovascular conditions was analyzed as predictors of neurocognitive function using generalized linear modeling (GLM) and adjusting for age at evaluation. Cumulative doses of pulmonary- or cardio-toxic drugs (anthracycline and bleomycin), thoracic RT (â‰¥30Gy vs Results: Survivors performed poorer than controls on short-term (mean[SD] Z-scores: -0.24 [1.0] vs 0.13 [1.0]; P =0.008) and long-term memory (-0.29 [1.1] vs 0.05 [1.1]; P =0.02), sustained attention (-0.60 [3.1] vs 0.24 [0.8]; P =0.005) and perseveration (-0.71 [3.2] vs 0.03 [0.9]; P =0.02), as well as fine-motor (-0.35 [1.0] vs 0.04 [0.8]; P =0.002), visual (0.24 [1.0] vs 0.69 [0.9]; P =0.002) and visual-motor (0.14 [1.0] vs 0.39 [1.0]; P =0.05) processing speed. Thirty-two percent of survivors had grade 2 or higher (moderate, severe/disabling, life-threatening) pulmonary conditions and 22% had grade 2 or higher cardiac conditions. Survivors treated with â‰¥30Gy thoracic RT were at greater risk of developing pulmonary conditions (51% vs 27%; P =0.01) and demonstrated worse visual (-0.06 [0.9] vs 0.40 [1.0]; P =0.009) and visual-motor (-0.12 [0.9] vs 0.28 [1.0]; P =0.02) processing speed, as compared to survivors treated with P >0.10) and anthracyline ( P >0.09) doses were not associated with neurocognitive function. Survivors with pulmonary conditions performed poorer than survivors without pulmonary/cardiovascular conditions, on sustained attention (-1.47 [3.5] vs -0.09 [2.2]; P =0.009), and visual (-0.28 [1.0] vs 0.46 [1.0]; P =0.003) and visual-motor (-0.23 [0.8] vs 0.30 [1.0]; P =0.005) processing speed. The presence of cardiovascular conditions was not associated with neurocognitive outcomes (Table 1). Current smokers (n=36) performed worse than non-current smokers (n=121) on measures of short-term (-0.71 [1.1] vs -0.11 [1.0]; P =0.004) and long-term (-1.01 [1.1] vs -0.07 [1.1]; P vs 0.01 [2.0]; P vs 0.37 [0.7]; P =0.001), and visual (-0.06 [0.7] vs 0.33 [1.0]; P =0.03) and visual-motor (-0.23 [0.8] vs 0.26 [1.0]; P =0.02) processing speed. Stratified analysis showed that in survivors without pulmonary conditions, current smokers were more impaired than non-current smokers on measures of short-term (-0.84 [1.1] vs -0.16 [1.0]; P =0.02) and long-term (-1.27 [0.9] vs -0.11 [1.1]; P =0.0005) memory, sustained attention (-2.25 [4.6] vs 0.29 [1.0]; P vs 0.39 [1.0]; P =0.03), whereas in survivors with pulmonary problems, smoking did not significantly contribute to worse neurocognitive outcomes. Conclusions: Roughly two decades after treatment, long-term survivors of HL demonstrate poorer neurocognitive performance compared to age- and sex-matched community controls. Chronic pulmonary conditions and current smoking status were associated with worse neurocognitive performance. Future studies should evaluate the contribution of pulmonary insufficiency to neurocognitive outcomes. Survivors of HL should be educated about the potential neurocognitive effects of smoking.

The aim of this study was to investigate if symbiotics may enhance the gut health benefit of pre- and probiotics. By growing a Caco-2 cell monolayer on permeable membranes in-vitro, the cell model can be used to mimic the small intestine epithelium. Stimulations were performed by adding selected fecal water samples from a large clinical trial on symbiotics to the apical side of the Caco-2 cell monolayer. To explore the mechanistic effects, NMR metabolomics was used to detect indirect effects of the Caco-2 cell monolayer and fecal water on the metabolic profiles of the cell media. Proteomics on the cells were carried out to determine if proteins were regulated by symbiotic treatment. Methods & Results: Â Stimulations were performed by adding fecal samples diluted in PBS and sterilized by filtration through a 0.22-micron filter from 26 subjects. The samples belong to 5 different groups: Placebo, A_responder, A_non-responder, A+B_responder, A+B_non-responder, where A+B is the symbiotic treatment. Caco-2 cells were seeded onto filter inserts and incubated in 24-well plates for 18 days. Stimulations were performed for 24 hours with 4 replicates. A hundred Î¼L sterile fecal water and 300 Î¼L cell media was added to the apical side. Four replicates of control samples on each plate were obtained by the addition of 400 Î¼L cell media to the apical side. Cell media from the apical and basolateral sides are collected at the end of the intervention. CaCo-2 cells were harvested, lysed and digested. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a Prodigy CryoProbe using standard 1D NOESY experiments. The 1H NMR spectra were automatically aligned, phased and binned prior to being analyzed by multivariate statistics. Proteomics were performed by using a nanoflow-LC connected to an Orbitrap Fusion. Proteins were identified using SEQUES HT + Percolator and quantified label-free in GeneData Expressionist. Regulated proteins were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Results in a total of 7057 proteins were identified using 1% false discovery rate (FDR). Statistical filtering of the preliminary quantitative results showed that 145 proteins were significantly regulated. Pathway analysis of regulated proteins in IPA, showed that several pathways were affected including inflammatory responses, immunological disease, and lipid metabolism. PCA analysis using the 145 proteins or the binned NMR spectra showed a weak tendency for subjects to separate between responders and non-responders in the group who received symbiotics. Conclusion:Â  TEER measurements on the Caco-2 cell monolayer model indicate a stronger gut barrier integrity as an effect of the symbiotic group. Differences in the metabolic profiles was found on the apical side between symbiotic responder vs. non-responder groups. No clear metabolic effect of the caco-2 cell monolayer could be found. Proteomics suggests that the effect from the symbiotic treatment effects pathways involved in cell proliferation of gut epithelium cells and ion transport across the cell layer. Regulated pathways observed in this study needs to be further investigated for their relationship to a symbiotic diet.",2017,Chemistry,"list(name = ""Christian C Yde"", ids = ""38364081""); list(name = ""Steffen Yde Bak"", ids = ""6033923""); list(name = ""Martin KrÃ¸yer Rasmussen"", ids = ""2743830""); list(name = ""Jette Feveile Young"", ids = ""8270311""); list(name = ""Henrik Max"", ids = ""151025715""); list(name = ""Lotta K.

However, it is possible that multiple cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites at the same locus could jointly exert their effects on human traits. Therefore, a region-based test that combines multiple markers could be more powerful. We used 2 different region-based tests to investigate the association between changes in DNA methylation and drug response, including the median methylation level test (MMLT) and sequence kernel association test (SKAT). No genes were found to be significantly associated with the drug response (for triglycerides, the false discovery rate ranged from 0.855 to 0.999; for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the false discovery rate ranged from 0.584 to 0.915).

bf1763a3bc44a1befd7659c5e4e3c1b73f729061,Omnisphero: a high-content image analysis (HCA) approach for phenotypic developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) screenings of organoid neurosphere cultures in vitro,"Current developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing in animals faces major limitations, such as high cost and time demands as well as uncertainties in their methodology, evaluation and regulation. Therefore, the use of human-based 3D in vitro systems in combination with high-content image analysis (HCA) might contribute to DNT testing with lower costs, increased throughput and enhanced predictivity for human hazard identification. Human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) grown as 3D neurospheres mimic basic processes of brain development including hNPC migration and differentiation and are therefore useful for DNT hazard identification. HCA of migrated neurospheres creates new challenges for automated evaluations because it encompasses variable cell densities, inconsistent z-layers and heterogeneous cell populations. We tackle those challenges with our Omnisphero software, which assesses multiple endpoints of the â€˜Neurosphere Assay.â€™ For neuronal identification, Omnisphero reaches a true positive rate (TPR) of 83.8Â % and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 11.4Â %, thus being comparable to the interindividual difference among two researchers (TPRÂ =Â 94.3, FDRÂ =Â 11.0Â %) and largely improving the results obtained by an existing HCA approach, whose TPR does not exceed 50Â % at a FDR above 50Â %. The high FDR of existing methods results in incorrect measurements of neuronal morphological features accompanied by an overestimation of compound effects. Omnisphero additionally includes novel algorithms to assess â€˜neurosphere-specificâ€™ endpoints like radial migration and neuronal density distribution within the migration area. Furthermore, a user-assisted parameter optimization procedure makes Omnisphero accessible to non-expert end users.",2016,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Martin R.

Recovery after surgery is highly variable. Risk-stratifying patients based on their predicted recovery profile will afford individualized perioperative management strategies. Recently, application of mass cytometry in patients undergoing hip arthroplasty revealed strong immune correlates of surgical recovery in blood samples collected shortly after surgery. However, the ability to interrogate a patient's immune state before surgery and predict recovery is highly desirable in perioperative medicine.


METHODS
To evaluate a patient's presurgical immune state, cell-type-specific intracellular signaling responses to ex vivo ligands (lipopolysaccharide, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10, and IL-2/granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) were quantified by mass cytometry in presurgical blood samples. Selected ligands modulate signaling processes perturbed by surgery. Twenty-three cell surface and 11 intracellular markers were used for the phenotypic and functional characterization of major immune cell subsets. Evoked immune responses were regressed against patient-centered outcomes, contributing to protracted recovery including functional impairment, postoperative pain, and fatigue.


RESULTS
Evoked signaling responses varied significantly and defined patient-specific presurgical immune states. Eighteen signaling responses correlated significantly with surgical recovery parameters (|R| = 0.37 to 0.70; false discovery rate < 0.01). Signaling responses downstream of the toll-like receptor 4 in cluster of differentiation (CD) 14 monocytes were particularly strong correlates, accounting for 50% of observed variance. Immune correlates identified in presurgical blood samples mirrored correlates identified in postsurgical blood samples.


CONCLUSIONS
Convergent findings in pre- and postsurgical analyses provide validation of reported immune correlates and suggest a critical role of the toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway in monocytes for the clinical recovery process. The comprehensive assessment of patients' preoperative immune state is promising for predicting important recovery parameters and may lead to clinical tests using standard flow cytometry.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Gabriela K.

7c2eff2523b7e79142be5fa53f0873aee14920c7,Effect of vitamin A supplementation on gut microbiota in children with autism spectrum disorders - a pilot study,"BackgroundDysbiosis of gut microbiota are commonly reported in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and may contribute to behavioral impairment. Vitamin A (VA) plays a role in regulation of gut microbiota. This study was performed to investigate the role of VA in the changes of gut microbiota and changes of autism functions in children with ASD.ResultsSixty four, aged 1 to 8Â years old children with ASD completed a 6-month follow-up study with VA intervention. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to assess plasma retinol levels. The Autism Behaviour Checklist (ABC), Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) were used to assess autism symptoms. CD38 and acid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORA) mRNA levels were used to assess autism-related biochemical indicatorsâ€™ changes. Evaluations of plasma retinol, ABC, CARS, SRS, CD38 and RORA mRNA levels were performed before and after 6Â months of intervention in the 64 children. Illumina MiSeq for 16S rRNA genes was used to compare the differences in gut microbiota before and after 6Â months of treatment in the subset 20 of the 64 children. After 6Â months of intervention, plasma retinol, CD38 and RORA mRNA levels significantly increased (all PÂ <Â 0.05); the scores of ABC, CARS and SRS scales showed no significant differences (all PÂ >Â 0.05) in the 64 children. Meanwhile, the proportion of Bacteroidetes/Bacteroidales significantly increased and the proportion of Bifidobacterium significantly decreased in the subgroup of 20 (all false discovery rate (FDR) qÂ <Â 0.05).ConclusionsBacteroidetes/Bacteroidales were the key taxa related to VA. Moreover, VA played a role in the changes in autism biomarkers. It remains unclear whether the VA concentration is associated with autism symptoms.Trial registrationThe study protocol was peer reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Chongqing Medical University in 2013 and retrospectively registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) on November 6, 2014 (TRN: ChiCTR-ROC-14005442).",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Juan Liu"", ids = ""37427978""); list(name = ""Xiao Liu"", ids = ""3025977""); list(name = ""Xue-Qin Xiong"", ids = ""7504629""); list(name = ""Ting Yang"", ids = ""143790735""); list(name = ""Ting Cui"", ids = ""39152621""); list(name = ""Nali Hou"", ids = ""37869247""); list(name = ""Xi Nan Lai"", ids = ""30403200""); list(name = ""Shu Liu"", ids = ""1779129""); list(name = ""Min Guo"", ids = ""144515972""); list(name = ""Xiao-hua Liang"", ids = ""46574092""); list(name = ""Qian Cheng"", ids = ""144761380""); list(name = ""Jie Chen"", ids = ""47740850""); list(name = ""Ting-Yu Li"", ids = ""153051064"")",9cfead99b35d319528326a84c407f35fadad8dba; e696872315076d497b0fdfe27bd2dd7278f5967d; a405f10366f21680f81a98209cabb1c00ba089a3; 76c95aa7c6952d7b09d0da2c5fb07a6ace55db73; 341461a8a630fca51efe70a9a46d7b8d3905572f; e0d23edf96c50dd38affa1617d07093d6eadeb40; c53038a65cf8b60e8702079e86452adcc409c9a7; 774bf720bce949054c780cce933f45b601cb88d6; 0b47f765ce90b2aa526cbef41fdf29a63422d45d; 8107c64c019088860c1223612378e38aacdadb1e; c5bd21a0c41d8ed9d172dbb5b6fd0a71320ea2a6,ce7d1a1ea1be8ad0a3a8781afa96a50f7c4eb090; 1a4c03b290221da73c5283355281be1b0d0ba83c; 6be7f1896a7e8877f1da98b766739ddd20eb88db; e28cca1885e2d7c169f3c7333d0834c69a6756d7; 70b48fd1a0c3d9fef98600578308e1e033c0c67a; 0f3303c100515556279178f2e0d59de4c5be9e2c; e47943aae0bba1251d249336e8f6090a931f464e; a3d4051547a0a36197902c7c3aea56af9e77af28; 663470c8b802cece90d5d3ab6cd165e4eec07816; 82e3e25a435d804ad44f38eaea76fc13cacd33eb; 5ac31bb2e2414303629e5f5de6b59579972ddc33; 2675e8b4a973b179584ba8dee6d19bfd818a081b; 0dcabeacce3afd07706befd3a890b5a63cfe5441; 7a818a49319b153671bcfad26594a47f692ce24f; 6ef7ab7d3bc2edc9ba31ca498c6a71e2ef2fa512; 21d8ad9f8f2986aa4b47854697dd38733d0f68c7; ce69a1b80aa5aec134199ccf36ea84b285be1706; 785a0d4797079ac199ca9f51b15c14798bd17162; d34f7c1f22ee1a8d0d17266f0ce54c46ae82d141; f2ee82682ac1c8d9e66322938dcda1d247716bbf; aa425ad022b713160d00952bd51cd115041241bb; 5d7218e2ab4c6d47c7196b1428565228adfc886b; f9bccdd9efd4936149b737a505f556b1b8de7015; f9015287daa17e9b6b3458a056d71a5ad5fceb8c; e50205d60dba9994fd33adb642c3118019e3ef36; f196625be12f5fe4c5625001dab6161366914fd3; 768058aa80aeecd1a115788993150c6df0347cb8; 42657ffa0bb5f516a20a524098bc621fc6585ce1; 2b18099896186741e27c43daa361b55b40686c50; 93c86f8032fed9d0ad29109a5e4688d66f79b185; e94f9365ae6ab514b6289f596c805a28b8f79298; c1b1990d16e104d2885dca6383a4be87ce73d5b9; ca6775640cd98024daf8b7ebcdb9c117b5a1d9b7; a7bc5af47d55bb1bc618574597946cf0691c9d2d; bd0964c535e853a5e87fddce5d17964a25d39c60; 7bf398378620a24a2bdf0953dc6033425c297fe2; 0c096b98135ba0937dedbcbc5f672770ba6afbac; 2ce8ab3625be297f0a7ff449187243e67e42fe16; 7c3b5de9692d292959d33616e3233082396c154f; 74151f735b7faa10d40bd5af40c768c22b339cab; f9f3955cbba5e29f63ecfd2219534b0f6cbaae4e; a4ed10c29b2fb22c68dfc5766b90bcaaf41608c0; f8c5fb76b1d4491b8355283fbe1285dde91e0699; becef245963ae1c9d360c10176f34ec564235be4; 05cd01c990c094df171f79eea187b53f945ea8b1; dea0f2708540323d1b9741af67d88a1dd8004723; 990f84604833ca1daf6ef917d030c5b4dee04d47; c5a771d21d9065fb4fec67dc4508ae79d313c759; 580ba7fc7844e4bd91f1018e6f80b5e49b273a4c; 4be7bc9ffe8977e2be0f2dbb8dab669b3ada2012; ca6480b68fab1de4c23adb187b5c292ae37fb994; ca752bd75fc60d567cf7b9e6ceb6eabe4a18443c; 2b289338ed12bfde65f2bc07c7acc89b82e415ef; 7b96e1dc57be20c97f08382740e7a83938cc0a10; 9cd992c5071acb165153572acbe683a3c7de01b1; 39246ca0d1e74185820b508333ba6f1be21a01d3; 60ee0e69c84214ab4314b0dd1893c9e5ffe6b4d6; 92c6dc9b4943d031200fc5646bc49e927b2cb750; bb60be38c15daee36ad1de646b935061f1b7dd5d; ad3879a1033cf045f0dccf942134a4c1a864a639; 0c098d5b9253f4938b81bd8b7ad919a263b39f2a; 51b3ca44ef3309b99e93107a144a806d1fe66431; a7e59393d2464aef18c02acfb459f60b616a206a; 502ef33c272443b318ee67aaafb9f5db1e778c4c; 0016c41900d332bafe6bad42e61479ca0446f16e; 3cc81bd9fdaa0b2f73227bdfe81afba92824ebfe; 7fd4d1e162445db5ed8ab708a41d9eaad202fa54,BMC Microbiology,17,

This approach has proven successful with targeted therapy in chronic myeloid leukaemia; however, we are concerned that extensive tumour heterogeneity occurs in ccRCC. In this study we evaluated heterogeneity and differential protein expression in sunitinib treated and untreated ccRCC samples using high-throughput proteomics.


METHODS
Fresh frozen tissue was obtained from 27 sunitinib naÃ¯ve ccRCC specimens and 27 nephrectomy samples from patients treated with neoadjuvant sunitinib (18 weeks) as part of the SuMR trial. From each tumour frozen sections were performed and up to 5 protein lysates obtained from each morphologically differing region of each tumour as well as matched normal kidney. Reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) were performed to assess the levels of multiple proteins relevant to ccRCC pathogenesis and sunitinib activity. Appropriate statistical tests were used to examine protein heterogeneity and differential expression, including false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Kaplan-Meier method was used to correlate changes in protein expression with outcome.


RESULTS
Expression of 20 proteins has been examined to date. The range of expression in tumours normalised by matched normal renal tissue had >2-fold differences in untreated (n=8 proteins) and treated samples (n=4 proteins). Four markers displayed significantly increased inter-tumoural variance in sunitinib treated tumours compared with untreated tissue (e.g. VEGFR1, FDR P<0.05). Despite this heterogeneity, sunitinib was associated with significant expression changes for several key proteins (e.g. VEGFR2, CyclinD2; FDR P<0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Protein expression in ccRCC is heterogenous and key proteins showed significantly increased variance of expression with sunitinib therapy. Despite heterogeneity, significant changes in protein expression can be identified with sunitinib treatment and have been correlated with outcome.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Grant D.

We used targeted mass spectrometry to study the metabolic fingerprint of urothelial cancer and determine whether the biochemical pathway analysis gene signature would have a predictive value in independent cohorts of patients with bladder cancer.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Pathologically evaluated, bladder derived tissues, including benign adjacent tissue from 14 patients and bladder cancer from 46, were analyzed by liquid chromatography based targeted mass spectrometry. Differential metabolites associated with tumor samples in comparison to benign tissue were identified by adjusting the p values for multiple testing at a false discovery rate threshold of 15%. Enrichment of pathways and processes associated with the metabolic signature were determined using the GO (Gene Ontology) Database and MSigDB (Molecular Signature Database). Integration of metabolite alterations with transcriptome data from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) was done to identify the molecular signature of 30 metabolic genes. Available outcome data from TCGA portal were used to determine the association with survival.


RESULTS
We identified 145 metabolites, of which analysis revealed 31 differential metabolites when comparing benign and tumor tissue samples. Using the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) Database we identified a total of 174 genes that correlated with the altered metabolic pathways involved. By integrating these genes with the transcriptomic data from theÂ corresponding TCGA data set we identified a metabolic signature consisting of 30 genes. The signature was significant in its prediction of survival in 95 patients with a low signature score vs 282 with a high signature score (p = 0.0458).

bbd352b0e4b08dd46e3cc1e1b489ab8c89c27650,Comparing the classification precision and prognostic performance of an intrinsic gastric cancer signature with existing genomic signatures in six independent datasets.,"4025 Background: Several gene expression signatures derived from supervised approaches based on histology, peritoneal or lymph node metastases and survival have been proposed to classify gastric adenocarcinomas and provide prognostic information. These studies had relatively small samples sizes.


METHODS
7 datasets of gene expression profiles across different microarray platforms were generated in house or obtained from collaborators, namely a panel of 37 gastric cancer cell lines (GCCL) with Affymetrix U133-2Plus and 549 patients from 6 independent patient cohorts (Affymetrix U133-2plus: 197 (Singapore), 70 (Australia), Affymetrix U133AB: 31 (UK), Illumina Human-6 v2 : 65 (Korea1), Custom arrays: 90 (HK), 96 (Korea2). Unsupervised techniques were used to distinguish major intrinsic subtypes from GCCLs and distinguishing features identified using Linear models for microarray data (LIMMA). We classified patient tumors using the nearest template prediction algorithm and evaluated classification precision and correlation with patient survival.


RESULTS
Beginning with unsupervised techniques, 2 major intrinsic subtypes were identified from our training set (GCCL). A 171-gene signature was identified. At a false discovery rate of 0.05, our signature precisely classified 432 (78.6%) of primary tumors with 61.1% to 88.6% of tumors precisely classified in each dataset and 55% of the classified tumors belonging to the larger of 2 intrinsic subgroups. With 5 other published signatures, classification precision was < 30%. This intrinsic subtypes classification provided prognostic information with the more aggressive subgroup having inferior overall survival: median survival: 30 mths vs 71mths (HR 1.48; 95%CI: 1.14-1.92, p<0.01, univariate analysis and HR 1.39 ; 95% CI: 1.05-1.78, p=0.02 after adjusting for stage). All other published gene signatures were not prognostic.


CONCLUSIONS
An intrinsic signature precisely classifies gastric cancers in 6 large patient cohorts from different countries and with microarray platforms and provides better prognostic information compared to existing signatures.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Iain Bee-Huat Tan"", ids = ""153842761""); list(name = ""Heike I Grabsch"", ids = ""48115654""); list(name = ""Han Toh"", ids = ""15919363""); list(name = ""Jeonghee Lee"", ids = ""6578561""); list(name = ""Alex Boussioutas"", ids = ""1755805""); list(name = ""Sun Young Rha"", ids = ""3141474""); list(name = ""Jaffer A.

Il est etabli que, si x suit une distribution elliptique, la condition est vraie ; dans le cas dâ€™une composition de distributions elliptiques il n y a aucune garantie que la condition soit verifiee globalement, pourtant, elle est respectee localement.On va donc proposer une extension sur la base de cette consideration. Etant donne une variable explicative x, Collaborative SIR realise dâ€™abord un clustering. Pour chaque cluster, la methode SIR est appliquee de maniere independante.Le resultat de chaque composant contribue a creer la solution finale.Le deuxieme papier, Student SIR, derive de la necessite de robustifier la methode SIR.Vu que cette derniere repose sur lâ€™estimation de la covariance et contient une etape APC, alors elle est sensible au bruit.Afin dâ€™etendre la methode SIR on a utilise une strategie fondee sur une formulation inverse du SIR, proposee par R.D. Cook.Finalement, Knockoff SIR est une extension de la methode SIR pour la selection des variables et la recherche dâ€™une solution sparse, ayant son fondement dans le papier publie par R.F. Barber et E.J. Candes qui met lâ€™accent sur le false discovery rate dans le cadre de la regression.

However, it is unknown which constituents of PM2.5 were mainly responsible for these associations. In a longitudinal panel study with 4 repeated measurements among 43 college students in Shanghai, China, we measured serum levels of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol, as indicators of HPA axis activation. Then, we evaluated the associations of 22 constituents of PM2.5 with these stress hormones using linear mixed-effect models. During the study period, the average daily concentration of PM2.5 was 41.1â€¯Î¼g/m3. We found that short-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with elevated levels of the 3 stress hormones. We observed that water-soluble inorganic ions, especially nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium, had stronger influences on 3 hormones. Six metallic elements, including Zn, Mn, Cu, Fe, Br, and Cr, had positive but generally instable associations with 3 hormones. The effects of organic carbon and elemental carbon on hormones were generally weak. When correcting for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate, NO3- was still significantly associated with CRH, but other important associations turned to be insignificant. An interquartile range increase in NO3- on the previous day were associated with 12.13% increase (95% confidence interval: 4.45%, 20.37%) in CRH. Our findings suggested that water-soluble inorganic constituents of PM2.5 (especially, NO3-) might have stronger influences on the activation of HPA axis than carbonaceous and elemental components.",2018,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yue Ting Niu"", ids = ""31633529""); list(name = ""Ren-jie Chen"", ids = ""120347074""); list(name = ""Yongjie Xia"", ids = ""3500626""); list(name = ""Jing Cai"", ids = ""48979718""); list(name = ""Zhekang Ying"", ids = ""2892169""); list(name = ""Zhijing Lin"", ids = ""7767024""); list(name = ""Cong Liu"", ids = ""49046791""); list(name = ""Chen Chen"", ids = ""48239897""); list(name = ""Li Peng"", ids = ""32279002""); list(name = ""Zhuohui Zhao"", ids = ""5105039""); list(name = ""Wenhao Zhou"", ids = ""153168979""); list(name = ""Jianmin Chen"", ids = ""50762839""); list(name = ""Dongfang Wang"", ids = ""51139703""); list(name = ""Juntao Huo"", ids = ""10194852""); list(name = ""Xinning Wang"", ids = ""50142260""); list(name = ""Qingyan Fu"", ids = ""7958400""); list(name = ""Haidong Kan"", ids = ""2136813"")",7bb0bb2e085a2fe2b50825262892bedf5d3aea35; f122da9f32d717f3c5881cb4d83349beb924520f; cc499cebeecf6dd12c1f2b3624311059950c6727; 99b246ba90581b5781451ed4eb80accd1a6d4c7f; 6b7db077f0b5039c590d2e37c26e8ea79b63aafb; f089fefc052d8c3fa52ce112f9edd830eff89b7e,c299cc86c8fbd710ded0a27f131e44dcdc9d0034; 90ab54d5bffe16cb8eb6e9c9811256c3de94ccf0; b919e81a5e2d79511a7056c69bc60b19ef9d434f; 21f516c95d44060473d805902b9566e8ebbc8deb; c46b34c5386b53a42a97dfa1bf7d163dae556bb8; 62e73a900dfc79a3c51d89c2c2d7f39ab9f05334; 25bdd1ee893f0ed8095e46d1fc4f25a8b50e352e; 1888ae228b7ab79049eece22cd28cd647c7acaae; 8fc37796ba21937c030917f44f02846273830247; 301ed7a28a7f90d0eeaa8d09545cfc62e90376bd; 1bf47c3b810e6ad99762bee8c888af425dcb1e15; e19f0c0247ce4287fe01af6b49b18bd4da64d8d1; 69288e8458022c27a06cacf469781f99dccf6dcf; 8ecd8b36e5b597b6a141a8cc2db68da59181b563; 5a70e1a1b18f319a1a18e723e772a94ddcaefdc8; c7f5c359aac9334db8eafb8dd45f61393297548a; d2f1ab37ebf63611306dd185988ce72cff6cc63f; fe9ba9468df2e1838dcce0c0ce8d69e6c67aeb48; 1a6d786fb1edfcdebf558ff8e6908a75ec6e14c5; e24f0fb9889051b2fc616c7fc550f33174a5c260; 35fd02f1eabee8b7ac76f5f6047ff3c322db5aa2; 7f458e4b0c1aed30b76aec2d040b5a0a41b5d726; 3ac51f5486c6e87e286fefbd8200285e1533f211; 5c00c750de1a008710df97364f4f5ac0536a08c3; cd939fe57ef58d4cb17e862cfba018358573c2a6; 7bcf76d41371907098c5490553bcfcf01a171d80; e1bb1d4a82538611530f2acb6cfdbd256721ff24; f665cf34e05730301ef349c5fd79707c32091007; 196a805437df179ef92c1eb3b8fa3afad4bc5438; af1830d2d363cbb66014990c7f317f2b318852bd; db6bf8c6b4479011d43c051239b6e3b5457a2022,Environment international,119,"

357faad0e061f46d0456ba024f65a2d35d56f670,Estimating the False Discovery Rate using SAS,"This paper gives an exposition of recently developed methods of estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) under multiple comparisons and discusses their implementation using SAS. For example, microarray experiments typically involve tests of significance for hundreds or thousands of genes. For biologists confronted by this problem of multiplicity, the FDR is an appealing quantification of error. Recent literature establishes theoretical properties of an estimator for FDR associated with any chosen critical region. SAS code using the SAS/MACRO, SAS/STAT, and SAS/IML facilities is presented to compute this estimate, and appears in the appendix. Q-values, which are to FDR as p-values are to the type I error rate, are also obtained and used to reproduce plots generated by the R package â€œqvalueâ€ that may be helpful for conducting multiple tests. Two approaches to estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses are considered. The first arises by choosing several values of a tuning parameter and fitting a smoothing spline (e.g. using PROC TPSPLINE ) to the resulting estimates.

9fa2d4015a2d18ab7a88b3252c49713b046001ec,Robust Analysis of High Throughput Screening (HTS) Assay Data,"Quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) assays use cells or tissues to screen thousands of compounds in a short period of time. Data generated from qHTS assays are then evaluated using nonlinear regression models, such as the Hill model, and decisions regarding toxicity are made using the estimates of the parameters of the model. For any given compound, the variability in the observed response may either be constant across dose groups (homoscedasticity) or vary with dose (heteroscedasticity). Since thousands of compounds are simultaneously evaluated in a qHTS assay, it is not practically feasible for an investigator to perform residual analysis to determine the variance structure before performing statistical inferences on each compound. Since it is well-known that the variance structure plays an important role in the analysis of linear and nonlinear regression models it is therefore important to have practically useful and easy to interpret methodology which is robust to the variance structure. Furthermore, given the number of chemicals that are investigated in the qHTS assay, outliers and influential observations are not uncommon. In this article we describe preliminary test estimation (PTE) based methodology which is robust to the variance structure as well as any potential outliers and influential observations. Performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated in terms of false discovery rate (FDR) and power using a simulation study mimicking a real qHTS data. Of the two methods currently in use, our simulations studies suggest that one is extremely conservative with very small power in comparison to the proposed PTE based method whereas the other method is very liberal. In contrast, the proposed PTE based methodology achieves a better control of FDR while maintaining good power. The proposed methodology is illustrated using a data set obtained from the National Toxicology Program (NTP).

c23ca8e58389708ea4f27f7d7b14538ef281b0f2,Predicting bioprocess targets of chemical compounds through integration of chemical-genetic and genetic interaction networks,"Chemical-genetic interactions â€“ observed when the treatment of mutant cells with chemical compounds reveals unexpected phenotypes â€“ contain rich functional information linking compounds to their cellular modes of action. To systematically identify these interactions, an array of mutants is challenged with a compound and monitored for fitness defects, generating a chemical-genetic interaction profile that provides a quantitative, unbiased description of the cellular function(s) perturbed by the compound. Genetic interactions, obtained from genome-wide double-mutant screens, provide a key for interpreting the functional information contained in chemical-genetic interaction profiles. Despite the utility of this approach, integrative analyses of genetic and chemical-genetic interaction networks have not been systematically evaluated. We developed a method, called CG-TARGET (Chemical Genetic Translation via A Reference Genetic nETwork), that integrates large-scale chemical-genetic interaction screening data with a genetic interaction network to predict the biological processes perturbed by compounds. CG-TARGET compared favorably to a baseline enrichment approach across a variety of benchmarks, achieving similar accuracy while substantially improving the ability to control the false discovery rate of biological process predictions. We applied CG-TARGET to a recent screen of nearly 14,000 chemical compounds in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, integrating this dataset with the global S. cerevisiae genetic interaction network to prioritize over 1500 compounds with high-confidence biological process predictions for further study. Upon investigation of the compatibility of chemical-genetic and genetic interaction profiles, we observed that one-third of observed chemical-genetic interactions contributed to the highest-confidence biological process predictions and that negative chemical-genetic interactions overwhelmingly formed the basis of these predictions. We present here a detailed characterization of the CG-TARGET method along with experimental validation of predicted biological process targets, focusing on inhibitors of tubulin polymerization and cell cycle progression. Our approach successfully demonstrates the use of genetic interaction networks in the functional annotation of compounds to biological processes.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Scott W.

Such brain scans result in large, complex, and noisy data, which makes data analysis challenging. The first part of the chapter focuses on data preparation and visualization techniques. This is followed by standard univariate linear modeling approaches, for which some effort needs to go into the computation of the expected BOLD signal and the design matrix specification. After fitting the regression models, a huge multiple testing problem arises. A corresponding section focuses on the false discovery rate, Gaussian random fields, and permutation tests including cluster-based thresholding. The last few sections describe specific multivariate methods popular in fMRI: independent component analysis, representational similarity analysis, and connectivity analysis.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Patrick Mair"", ids = ""8598303"")",4e01cfe8b85fb8e4e56a7e17e565d8b3ab476a30,,,,409-450
e022e3b593b087c138d7c1fd49973a4ccfc99c47,"A Systematic Evaluation of Hospital Performance of Childbirth Delivery Modes and Associated Factors in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (North-Eastern Italy), 2005â€“2015","Cesarean sections (CS) have become increasingly common in both developed and developing countries, raising legitimate concerns regarding their appropriateness. Since improvement of obstetric care at the hospital level needs quantitative evidence, using routinely collected health data we contrasted the performance of the 11 maternity centres (coded with an alphabetic letter A to K) of an Italian region, Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG), during 2005â€“15, after removing the effect of several factors associated with different delivery modes (DM): spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD), instrumental vaginal delivery (IVD), overall CS (OCS) and urgent/emergency CS (UCS). A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted for each individual DM, using a dichotomous outcome (1â€‰=â€‰each DM; 0â€‰=â€‰rest of hospital births) and comparing the stratum specific estimates of every term with their respective reference categories. Results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) false discovery rates (FDR) approach was applied to control alpha error due to the large number of statistical tests performed. In the entire FVG region during 2005â€“2015, SVD were 75,497 (69.1% out of all births), IVD were 7,281 (6.7%), OCS were 26,467 (24.2%) and UCS were 14,106 (12.9% of all births and 53.3% out of all CS). SVD were more likely (in descending order of statistical significance) with: higher number of previous livebirths; clerk/employed occupational status of the mother; gestational age <29 weeks; placentas weighing <500â€‰g; stillbirth; premature rupture of membranes (PROM). IVD were predominantly more likely (in descending order of statistical significance) with: obstructed labour, non-reassuring fetal status, history of CS, labour analgesia, maternal age â‰¥35 and gestation >40 weeks. The principal factors associated with OCS were (in descending order of statistical significance): CS history, breech presentation, non-reassuring fetal status, obstructed labour, multiple birth, placental weight â‰¥ 600â€‰g, eclampsia/pre-eclampsia, maternal age â‰¥ 35 and oligohydramnios. The most important risk factors for UCS were (in descending order of statistical significance): placenta previa/abruptio placenta/ antepartum hemorrage; non-reassuring fetal status, obstructed labour; breech presentation; PROM, eclampsia/pre-eclampsia; gestation 33â€“36 weeks; gestation 41+ weeks; oligohydramnios; birthweight <2,500â€‰g, maternal age â‰¥ 35 and cord prolapse. After removing the effects of all other factors, we found great variability of DM rates across hospitals. Adjusting for all risk factors, all hospitals had a OCS risk higher than the referent (hospital G). Out of these 10 hospitals with increased adjusted risk of OCS, 9 (A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J, K) performed less SVD and 5 (A, C, D, I, J) less IVD. In the above 5 centres CS was therefore probably overused. The present study shows that routinely collected administrative data provide useful information for health planning and monitoring. Although the overall CS rate in FVG during 2005â€“15 was 24.2%, well below the corresponding average Italian national figure (38.1%), the variability of DM rates across FVG maternity centres could be targeted by policy interventions aimed at further reducing the recourse to unnecessary CS.

ffa7a884830673174bd127ce7abf0c3ae6a537d6,Inference about causation between body mass index and DNA methylation in blood from a twin family study,"Background Several studies have reported DNA methylation in blood to be associated with body mass index (BMI), but only a few have investigated causal aspects of the association. We used a twin family design to assess this association at two life points and applied a novel analytical approach to investigate the evidence for causality. Methods The methylation profile of DNA from peripheral blood was measured for 479 Australian women (mean age 56 years) from 130 twin families. Linear regression was used to estimate the associations of methylation at ~410 000 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG), and of the average methylation at ~20 000 genes, with current BMI, BMI at age 18-21 years, and the change between the two (BMI change). A novel regression-based methodology for twins, Inference about Causation through Examination of Familial Confounding (ICE FALCON), was used to assess causation. Results At 5% false discovery rate, nine, six and 12 CpGs at 24 loci were associated with current BMI, BMI at age 18-21 years and BMI change, respectively. The average methylation of BHLHE40 and SOCS3 loci was associated with current BMI, and of PHGDH locus was associated with BMI change. From the ICE FALCON analyses with BMI as the predictor and methylation as the outcome, a womanâ€™s methylation level was associated with her co-twinâ€™s BMI, and the association disappeared conditioning on her own BMI, consistent with BMI causing methylation. To the contrary, using methylation as the predictor and BMI as the outcome, a womanâ€™s BMI was not associated with her co-twinâ€™s methylation level, consistent with methylation not causing BMI. Conclusion For middle-aged women, peripheral blood DNA methylation at several genomic locations is associated with current BMI, BMI at age 18-21 years and BMI change. Our study suggests that BMI has a causal effect on peripheral blood DNA methylation.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Shuai Li"", ids = ""47319758""); list(name = ""Ee Ming Wong"", ids = ""16040234""); list(name = ""Minh Bui"", ids = ""145471549""); list(name = ""Tuong L Nguyen"", ids = ""145947889""); list(name = ""Ji-Hoon Eric Joo"", ids = ""1601458804""); list(name = ""Jennifer Stone"", ids = ""48122570""); list(name = ""Gillian S Dite"", ids = ""6882633""); list(name = ""Pierre-Antoine DuguÃ©"", ids = ""49198258""); list(name = ""Roger L.

4a819e1ed33531159db077ca08bb40519f6a85f5,Computational Prediction of miRNA Regulations in Mouse Whole Brain Using in situ Hybridization Data,"Recent research for microRNA (miRNA) expression has revealed its importance in vertebrate animals especially for gene silencing at the synapse. Many researchers have measured miRNA expressions to investigate such miRNA activity by microRNA array, RT-PCR, RNA-seq, and so on. It is, however, still impossible to investigate an extent of miRNA regulation directly. Therefore, we tried to predict it by examining relationships between mRNA expressions and an existence of some 7-mer (seed of miRNA) sequences in its 3â€™UTR using the data from Allen Brain Atlas database. At first, we calculated p-values using hyper geometric distribution (HGD) about strength of mRNA expression and seed existence. Shuffled mRNA 3â€™UTR sequences were used as a control. We also applied a FDR control for p-values obtained from HGD. We were able to predict many regulations of miRNA specifically to brain organs by HGD and some of which agreed with previous research, miR-200 family and let-7 family, for example. After applying the false discovery rate (FDR) control method, however, many local regulations were veiled and the influence of seed sequence specific bias was observed. It supposed to be because of differences of seed frequency after 3â€™UTR shuffling. To avoid such bias, it is necessary to account for a frequency of seed appearances in shuffled 3'UTRs. So we calculated each seed frequency compared with shuffles to get â€œwordscoreâ€, which means Z-score of mean-adjusted cumulated score of logarithms of seed frequency in order of mRNA expressions. We obtained the wordscores and their ranks at each position. The distributions of wordscore rank showed some seeds, for example miR-124 and miR-137 previously reported to relate with brain and neuron, had high orders of wordscore at many positions and inferred to have relationships with mRNA expressions. In conclusion, our method is useful to predict miRNA or some signatures regulating broadly and also has a potential to predict local regulations combining the method to detect localization of high wordscores.",2012,,"list(name = ""Risa Kawaguchi"", ids = ""3411724""); list(name = ""Hisanori Kiryu"", ids = ""34687641"")",,,,,
1a9227a2de308f94426043578b02ac369023a385,Functional somatotopy revealed across multiple cortical regions using a model of complex motor task,"The primary motor cortex (M1) possesses a functional somatotopic structure-representations of adjacent within-limb joints overlap to facilitate coordination while maintaining discrete centers for individuated movement. We examined whether similar organization exists across other sensorimotor cortices. Twenty-four right-handed healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while tracking complex targets with flexion/extension at right finger, elbow and ankle separately. Activation related to each joint at false discovery rate of 0.005 served as its representation across multiple regions. Within each region, we identified the center of mass (COM) for each representation, and the overlap between the representations of within-limb (finger and elbow) and between-limb joints (finger and ankle). Somatosensory (S1) and premotor cortices (PMC) demonstrated greater distinction of COM and minimal overlap for within- and between-limb representations. In contrast, M1 and supplementary motor area (SMA) showed more integrative somatotopy with higher sharing for within-limb representations. Superior and inferior parietal lobule (SPL and IPL) possessed both types of structure. Some clusters exhibited extensive overlap of within- and between-limb representations, while others showed discrete COMs for within-limb representations. Our results help to infer hierarchy in motor control. Areas such as S1 may be associated with individuated movements, while M1 may be more integrative for coordinated motion; parietal associative regions may allow switch between both modes of control. Such hierarchy creates redundant opportunities to exploit in stroke rehabilitation. The use of complex rather than traditionally used simple movements was integral to illustrating comprehensive somatotopic structure; complex tasks can potentially help to understand cortical representation of skill and learning-related plasticity.",2013,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""David A.

7f207af18b159499fb4a69ef4961a6f53ab05a2e,Multi-resolution localization of causal variants across the genome,"We present KnockoffZoom, a flexible method for the genetic mapping of complex traits at multiple resolutions. KnockoffZoom localizes causal variants precisely and provably controls the false discovery rate using artificial genotypes as negative controls. Our method is equally valid for quantitative and binary phenotypes, making no assumptions about their genetic architectures.

ACPA are usually detected using the anti-CCP test, identifying antibodies against a broad spectrum of citrullinated antigens. Most citrullinated antigens however appear to be bystander antigens that are not thought to be involved in the disease process. While controversy remains over the identity of the pathogenic antigen, it has been hypothesised that the fine-specificity of the ACPA response in the patient harbours prognostic properties. For this purpose sera will be studied from early RA patients using a novel technique that might reveal differences in that fine-specificity of the ACPA response. Materials and Methods We recently showed that the antibody response to a particular antigen results in rearranged immunoglobulin segments that are shared between individuals exposed to that antigen. In patients with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes, such sequences were found after proteomics analysis of affinity enriched immunoglobulins. In the current study, ACPA positive RA sera were drawn from 58 patients participating in the tREACH-study. This is a study with a protocolised treatment regime for patients with early RA aimed at obtaining low-disease activity (DAS Results Up to 1 Âµg of CCP specific IgG was obtained from 180 Âµl of serum. The LC-MS data was analysed for correlations between ACPA derived peptides and the need for treatment with anti-TNF to control disease activity. However, no such correlations were found in excess of the false discovery rate in this dataset. In addition to ACPA, we also affinity purified rheumatoid factors from sera as a control. These preparations could be distinguished from the ACPA, suggesting our method performed appropriately. Conclusions Our experiments could not show a significant difference between anti-CCP antibodies in early RA sera from patients with different disease outcome. While this could indicate that anti-CCP fine-specificities are not associated with disease outcome, additional experiments are needed to interpret these results. In future work we will compare IgG with known affinity to subclasses of CCP antigens to verify that our technique distinguishes these more subtle differences in epitope specificity. In addition, it will be investigated whether fine specificity may affect the progression to arthritis in ACPA+ arthralgia patients.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Martijn M. van Duijn"", ids = ""39129145""); list(name = ""Theo M.

20da7c642447c3a5ecaab261ff049b052dbc6166,Efficiency of genome-wide association study in random cross populations,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with plant species have employed inbred lines panels. Our objectives were to present additional quantitative genetics theory for GWAS, evaluate the relative efficiency of GWAS in non-inbred and inbred populations and in an inbred lines panel, and assess factors affecting GWAS. Fifty samples of 400 individuals from populations with linkage disequilibrium were simulated. Individuals were genotyped for 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotyped for traits controlled by 10 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 90 minor genes, assuming different degrees of dominance and heritabilities of 40 and 80%. The average SNP density was 0.1 centiMorgan and the QTL heritabilities ranged from 3.2 to 11.8%. To increase the QTL detection power, the additive-dominance model must be fitted for traits controlled by dominance effects but must not be fitted for traits showing no dominance. The power of detection was maximized increasing the sample size to 400 and the false discovery rate (FDR) to 5%. The average power of detection for the low, intermediate, and high heritability QTLs were 9.7, 32.7, and 87.7%, respectively. Under sample size of 400 the observed FDR was equal to or lower than the specified level of significance. The association mapping was highly precise. The analysis of the inbred random cross population provided essentially the same results from the non-inbred population. The inbred lines panel provided the best results concerning the low and intermediate heritability QTL detection power, FDR, and mapping precision. The FDR is mainly affected by population structure, compared to relationship information.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""JosÃ© Marcelo Soriano Viana"", ids = ""36532774""); list(name = ""Gabriel Borges Mundim"", ids = ""4947038""); list(name = ""Helcio Duarte Pereira"", ids = ""30122773""); list(name = ""AndrÃ©a Carla Bastos Andrade"", ids = ""39990230""); list(name = ""Fabyano Fonseca e Silva"", ids = ""35837834"")",,910f9a11a46b632e435762955288da23ba7370e0; 75f481c52148432bad0fdd6f8082d1a0b5105531; 73aba37ca793ce9837e007e860c9da0a97360034; 1d85191f9a268bb7a3d6e00197fd8e50fb1e9870; f1430cbf70841e9dee242c3be43a11d3ef31200b; 1a6b223b5ee5ac78c81b562c857dddeca8dd171a; 113d6586327b9a919779e73f609ac840634e1f66; be0f02677634e0b9acfd40ef1fead18932dfd6a2; 61a1ba7074433447a8583f49c5f88fffc3b556ac; a9b588803315d93882007b894b53003563067408; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 2fe4d7deb937d1c126c8981ba3a4d42871ff5ac3; 0b52dd6c425e64ae7e82a05eeca5435385397e2a; 8f48fc887982fad851ecb486ef0d471f3e7f3a48; 9e44e2143d53f4f73c686b29432d669305c7a7ea; 8ff34cfc1efd73fabadbd5e02e1be92beb27fd54; c7382e3743a800a04e72b1bdf3185a6f9af2b3ca; 604a87fa3099476cd1584b143350ee6980dd5a15; 92f2529251af27662252623b8ee0d2082d0e726a; e9921b543467fb9a0c678539a979b79c6ecd8858; 0a417a5b09afa0eda0d037559b5ec8cee1d17e30; 5d8687679461a8957257ba52d5914e7e215b3971; 457d598b45010c6c689536ad661e4d7a089e8e2d; 0b154ec416bcaf10ffd3456719c555e7fc99c8f5,bioRxiv,,
d6d97ed3c822a59199badbc15865b2e695fbdcab,Bayesian multiple testing procedures for hotspot identification.,"Ranking a group of candidate sites and selecting from it the high-risk locations or hotspots for detailed engineering study and countermeasure evaluation is the first step in a transport safety improvement program. Past studies have however mainly focused on the task of applying appropriate methods for ranking locations, with few focusing on the issue of how to define selection methods or threshold rules for hotspot identification. The primary goal of this paper is to introduce a multiple testing-based approach to the problem of selecting hotspots. Following the recent developments in the literature, two testing procedures are studied under a Bayesian framework: Bayesian test with weights (BTW) and a Bayesian test controlling for the posterior false discovery rate (FDR) or false negative rate (FNR). The hypotheses tests are implemented on the basis of two random effect or Bayesian models, namely, the hierarchical Poisson/Gamma or Negative Binomial model and the hierarchical Poisson/Lognormal model. A dataset of highway-railway grade crossings is used as an application example to illustrate the proposed procedures incorporating both the posterior distribution of accident frequency and the posterior distribution of ranks. Results on the effects of various decision parameters used in hotspot identification procedures are discussed.",2007,Medicine; Engineering,"list(name = ""Luis Miranda-Moreno"", ids = ""1398324575""); list(name = ""AurÃ©lie Labbe"", ids = ""144161892""); list(name = ""Liping Fu"", ids = ""47638154"")",51bfac0b1005053da2030f0c1fdcac2183619ae8; 52f24a80dbf1f3b46f02b46c174d2597260f664f; a2162fc3d3ad78fd1977e8b04a84cddb1003ebbd; dbf4d4ced8ea6d330e097ac8d581fbec6328d207; 24b96b38c8c029cdb4d7add7a0ed139fa6557454; d3b6811939ad259c7a7e92eb1d6bc4cd8455d897; 88c8feb781d8ad5e48c1d04dffa2b06aa9488dcb; 6b3b748e0e26d60564d1889ed5ad74547452e278; f1642524a8530e73b2545ccf3ff1941d660e947c; 3ae319687b52ea6ff658948cd9c66af7ece78fe6; a5c2ebd365f0487076821870d5c71052ba396a38; cc5b05d5c294bb529c0b044a1d631ff1935e2b0a; 184efd15286d4cd1d8035b5d3db886d1ce5186da; c01daf49936bcf502c7da7577829eb43efa50918; 8a8da81c0f4d29a4f709e5c85b0e7827692c8526; 1c0b0fb725da285b34df0444ae48588658a2dc85; cdbcf22afc23b63770a37d1cf5907d1fb318e65e; 8f96619a55275a9c0148bee6aed2366e48973646; 09a54ec4a8d088d2dd17efd5cabd00474cfc445d; 3b0a631eea366d2647f28b940f29b2407285c2c3; ba49ca7139a6c693f447f576d8944c003980596e; 5068a7ee7767b9e0078906a80748b3b08a37cc5c; 8a7e636530cd4d58e6ae521be5b7799ae6be9c33; 047f91ec7bf9c213fa851eeab96144401a3ed32b; f4b20d9d653568c8c713ff327215468c793414ac; 1e3732838c303d5d0f7ed5db42649157b6117d75; cdf01fe0d864a87003310414326a056f3a02a6ad; dd38e5c9a15a6da3985b71f338d91f8b05f27431; 1e7bb53350ad14d205d94ed518055c2e501a8217,02963ec629803df4f6b23ddee04ced492f987856; 71a8f2274bed946abffa671da7bd9e4f29c1f3ea; 08600900eac695fdba3bf453c6f02a6bf4b7f236; 4a6fe45e099fdbee848c09514d634d4dab0b4780; 1b31599aaceeeacf090ad1aea6dc00fda4c1b640; 1b51f7d969560dc333acde67fe9b6507b14dee44; 05e99a197c2120a187440b8b4aecb5cbd175c22e; 889fa3439b863f161b372561652a365a26854d2a; 49201e6ab9b8fd21c103671102bc04ecf28c32df; 03f124d2a608b8f367296a668bbad20f4bd3256c; ee48bd87f2a4b4b0a17be33f818f7e66fe80398f; 1038ace808db7981146f67971283c4229c25fd6c; aa9cff8e6331bc264d64912346a63a78baba0a5c; 4378a7eb357dbfd3203f3f708ce254851e3626a1; 50feb255c32128830ad50ca65d0c90ca69219a55; 6b9f7f214abbe504b8ba69be77c030eb1fc44412; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c4936a7f245fd7ce4575ef5d3e6b6a77442139bb; 03be636697c84eb22114f09de6c1bea215cc87c8; 4b234bb1ee49928a3d779088213a5319e6ac3789,Accident; analysis and prevention,39 6,"

This MAGIC population consists of a set of 189 genotypes from the GÃ¶ttingen Winter Bean Population. The association panel was tested in two different experiments, i.e. a frost and a hardening experiment. Six morphological traits, leaf fatty acid composition, relative water content in shoots were scored in this study. The genotypes presented a large genetic variation for all traits that were highly heritable after frost and after hardening. High phenotypic significant correlations were established between traits. The principal coordinates analysis resulted in no clear structure in the current population. Association mapping was performed using a general linear model and mixed linear model with kinship. A False discovery rate of 0.20 (and 0.05) was used to test the significance of marker-trait association. As a result, many putative QTLs for 13 morphological and physiological traits were detected using both models.

GSK3 is an important mediator in many physiological processes including glycogen metabolism, apoptosis and gene transcription. In addition, GSK3 is implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia and cancer, where it exhibits deregulated activity. In this study, we sought to determine the neuronal genes regulated by both Wnt and insulin in an in vitro cell culture model to further elucidate the signalling roles GSK3 plays in the CNS. Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 whole genome microarrays were used to explore the expression profiles of rat primary cortical neurones treated with recombinant Wnt3a (10 nM) or insulin (50 nM) for 2 h. Following a conservative correction (Bonferroni) for multiple testing, seven genes were identified to be differentially expressed from controls; four of these genes were regulated by insulin and three genes were regulated by both insulin and Wnt3a. The data were also analysed using a false discovery rate cut off, which is a less stringent correction for multiple testing. This approach yielded 105 genes that were differentially regulated from controls; 72 of the gene changes were attributable to insulin treatment, 11 were because of Wnt3a treatment and 22 genes were altered by both insulin and Wnt3a. These data demonstrate that the Wnt and insulin pathways exhibit both divergent and overlapping signalling activities in neuronal cells. The overlapping transcriptional response was not attributable to Wnt3a activating Akt. These findings have ramifications for neurodevelopment and neurological diseases, in which the Wnt and insulin signalling pathways are implicated.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Claudie Hooper"", ids = ""4636305""); list(name = ""Richard Killick"", ids = ""40375935""); list(name = ""Cathy Fernandes"", ids = ""46589411""); list(name = ""Graham Cocks"", ids = ""4004101""); list(name = ""David Sugden"", ids = ""152746710""); list(name = ""Simon Lovestone"", ids = ""1380128391"")",c75bdf97bbda09a1d55b4d203e153e3717e58c04; 6fcd3410d6553e040c1a3feda26e87b9a169634c; 1c4d153e7a1cc7a7c1a9a071bdd5e709b5ca5cb7; 4306f3e3c62c32f83a9058405dcb1473b2292bdb; c6852172d29875588652655a2f7d528e366b13d9; 8535b5294e93674ab75c39698d28304eb6184ffd,,Journal of neurochemistry,118 4,"

fe5dc767d7362bc592df77066d3c59016fb112ed,Genetic Association Of a MAPK8 Expression Quantitative Trait Locus With Pre-Capillary Pulmonary Hypertension In Sickle Cell Disease,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with pleiotropic clinical outcomes, the severity of which exhibits remarkable inter-individual variability. Investigations of the pathophysiology of SCD have focused on the adverse effects of vaso-occlusion, chronic inflammation, and hemolysis. SCD is also characterized by up-regulation of the hypoxic response to chronic anemia. We postulated that the up-regulated hypoxic response in SCD contributes to altered gene expression that might impact pulmonary hypertension, a complication associated with early mortality.

To identify genes regulated by the hypoxic response and not other effects of chronic anemia, we compared expression variation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 sickle cell anemia untreated with hydroxyurea and 15 Chuvash polycythemia (CP) patients characterized by homozygous VHL R200W -induced constitutive up-regulation of hypoxia inducible factors in the absence of anemia or hypoxia. Gene expression of both cohorts was profiled on identical Affymetrix exon arrays. The degree and direction of differential gene expression were highly correlated between sickle cell anemia and CP (Spearmanâ€™s Ï = 0.73 between regression coefficients of differential gene expression), suggesting that 53% of expression variation in sickle cell anemia is related to hypoxic transcriptional responses. At 5% false discovery rate (FDR), 1040 genes exhibited a >1.15 fold change in both sickle cell anemia and VHL R200W homozygotes, among which 297 were up-regulated and 743 down-regulated. Hypoxia strongly induced inflammatory response pathways but suppressed T-cell activation in sickle cell anemia. MAPK8 , encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase important for stress-induced apoptosis, T-cell differentiation and inflammatory responses, was a hypoxia down-regulated gene and played a central role in hypoxic gene regulation in sickle cell anemia according to gene network analysis.

To assess the genetic contribution to hypoxic transcriptional variation among SCD patients, we mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for the 1,040 hypoxia response genes. Association mapping with a focus on local regulatory polymorphisms in 61 SCD patients identified eQTL for 103 of the hypoxia response genes at 5% FDR. We further tested the hypothesis that these hypoxic eQTL potentially underlie heterogeneity in risk of pulmonary hypertension in an additional SCD cohort (University of Illinois cohort). In this cohort, the A allele of an eQTL of MAPK8 , rs10857560, was associated with pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure â‰¥25 and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure â‰¤15 mm Hg at right heart catheterization (allele frequency=0.66; OR=4.4, P=0.00037, n=238). This association was confirmed in another independent cohort (Walk-PHaSST cohort) (allele frequency=0.65; OR=7.2, P=0.0025, n=519). The homozygous AA genotype of rs10857560, which was associated with decreased MAPK8 expression, was present in all 14 identified pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension cases among the combined 757 SCD patients (P = 6 x 10-6 by the Fisher exact test). Our study demonstrates a prominent hypoxic transcription component in SCD that in part contributes to pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension.

99cf13d633f6ec7f1c4841195e3e49be206f9bcd,Glucose levels and genetic variants across transcriptional pathways: interaction effects with BMI,"Objective:Much of the genetic variation in glucose levels remains to be discovered. Especially, research on geneâ€“environment interactions is scarce. Overweight is one of the main risk factors for hyperglycemia. As transcriptional regulation is important for both weight maintenance and glucose control, we analyzed 353 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), occurring in transcriptional pathways of glucose and lipid metabolism in interaction with body mass index (BMI) on glucose levels.Research design and methods:SNPs were measured in 3244 participants of the Doetichem cohort. Non-fasting glucose levels and BMI were measured twice in 6 years. SNP Ã— BMI interactions were analyzed by mixed models and adjusted for age, sex, time since last meal, and follow-up time. False discovery rate (FDR) <0.2 was used to adjust for multiple testing.Results:Two SNPs in the PPARGC1A gene (rs8192678, FDR=0.07; rs3755863, FDR=0.17) showed a significant interaction with BMI. The rare allele of both SNPs was associated with significantly lower glucose levels in subjects with a BMIâ©½25â€‰kgâ€‰mâ€“2 (rs8192678, P=0.02; rs3755863, P=0.03). An inverse association was suggested in subjects with a BMI>28â€‰kgâ€‰mâ€“2. A small intervention study (n=120) showed similar, though non-significant, results.Conclusions:Using a pathway-based approach, we found that BMI significantly modified the association between two SNPs in the PPARGC1A gene and glucose levels. The association between glucose and PPARGC1A was only present in lean subjects.

c52299ae358d5c44bff2fdce5864177a9df67d63,Proteomic analysis identifies insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-related protein-1 as a podocyte product.,"The podocyte secretory proteome may influence the phenotype of adjacent podocytes, endothelial cells, parietal epithelial cells, and tubular epithelial cells but has not been systematically characterized. We have initiated studies to characterize this proteome, with the goal of further understanding the podocyte cell biology. We cultured differentiated conditionally immortalized human podocytes and subjected the proteins in conditioned medium to mass spectrometry. At a false discovery rate of <3%, we identified 111 candidates from conditioned medium, including 44 proteins that have signal peptides or are described as secreted proteins in the UniProt database. As validation, we confirmed that one of these proteins, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-related protein-1 (IGFBP-rP1), was expressed in mRNA and protein of cultured podocytes. In addition, transforming growth factor-Î²1 stimulation increased IGFBP-rP1 in conditioned medium. We analyzed IGFBP-rP1 glomerular expression in a mouse model of human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy. IGFBP-rP1 was absent from podocytes of normal mice and was expressed in podocytes and pseudocrescents of transgenic mice, where it was coexpressed with desmin, a podocyte injury marker. We conclude that IGFBP-rP1 may be a product of injured podocytes. Further analysis of the podocyte secretory proteome may identify biomarkers of podocyte injury.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Takayuki Matsumoto"", ids = ""153885372""); list(name = ""Sonja Hess"", ids = ""2356269""); list(name = ""Hiroshi Kajiyama"", ids = ""46539410""); list(name = ""Toru Sakairi"", ids = ""48096593""); list(name = ""Moin Saleem"", ids = ""144126663""); list(name = ""Peter W.

f852ddfca7fa6f63beb63070782d3079b05468b8,Heirarchical clustering and beyond in PCOS endometrium: brave new world.,"What is a clinician to make of microarrays? We accepted the adage of one gene one protein in our school years, and now we are blessed with the ability to measure the relative expression of 22,000 genes at once, creating enough data from one experiment to last a lifetime. The models used to analyze such data are beyond our comprehension, and even the culled results are dizzying in their complexity. The article by Kim et al. (1) weaves together microarray, expression, and protein data to tell an intriguing story about PCOS endometrium and ultimately PCOS. Should we gaze upon this â€œbrave new worldâ€ of science with the wonder of Miranda in Shakespeareâ€™s Tempest (our naivete and optimism may be similar) or with the irony Aldous Huxley intended in his antiutopian novel of the same name (we are also older and worldly wise and still waiting for the bounty of the genetic revolution to trickle down)? 
 
A complex syndrome like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with myriad reproductive and metabolic abnormalities calls for complex solutions. The investigators designed a study to examine dysregulated signaling pathways in the endometrium of women with PCOS (1) that is both tantalizing and frustrating. The authors have performed an enormous amount of work proceeding from microarray to pathway mapping to protein detection. They present a consistent, well-documented, if not counterintuitive story about a down-regulated, quiescent endometrium (at least the stroma) in PCOS. But how is the systemic down-regulation of signaling pathways and diminished cellular proliferation of the stromal endometrium consistent with an increased risk for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in women with PCOS? 
 
The endometrium is a remarkably understudied and comparatively easily accessible tissue, and its choice is one of the many strengths of the study. It is a pathological tissue target in women with PCOS, from implantation failure to hyperplasia to cancer. The authors used a case-control study of 12 women with PCOS compared with a control population of 12 women with regular menses and biopsied the endometrium in a progestin-free environment, i.e. chronic anovulation for PCOS and the early follicular phase for controls. They were matched for endometrial thickness (all 6â€“9 mm), a potential weakness of the study given that a thicker PCOS endometrium might have yielded a more proliferative result. Another confounder is the difficulty in comparing a dynamic state of flux, i.e. the cycling women with evolving endometrium vs. the PCOS state of chronic unopposed estrogen/androgen. (Is endometrial torpor the correct term?) They chose a relatively thin endometrium to study, perhaps limited by the thickness in the early proliferative phase in cycling control women. What about the women with PCOS with thick endometriums? Arenâ€™t they the ones we worry about clinically? 
 
A portion of tissue was snap-frozen for RNA analysis, and another portion was fixed for histology and eventual immunohistochemistry. These samples were then divided into three groups; one third (n = 4 from each group) was randomly selected for microarray hybridization with the Affymetrix GeneChip (with âˆ¼22,000 genes) and two thirds for further validation of findings with real time RT-PCR. The data were then analyzed with a computational method (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis-GSEA) developed by researchers at the Broad Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This program determines whether an a priori defined set of genes (involved in a certain biological pathway and/or signaling process) shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states (i.e. phenotypes such as PCOS and normally cycling women). They noted that 44 gene sets were enriched in normal endometrium vs. only two in women with PCOS (these were Hox_List and Glycerolipid metabolism). Of note, in comparison to findings in theca cells and oocytes of women with PCOS (2,3,4), no changes were noted in androgen-regulated pathways. 
 
The authors then validated expression of specific genes in select pathways using real time RT-PCR and demonstrated convincingly that genes encoding enzymes involved in glycolysis and integrin-mediated cell adhesion are down-regulated in PCOS endometrium. It is tempting to speculate that these changes mirror systemic problems such as a predisposition to diabetes and increased risks of miscarriage noted in women with PCOS. Finally, the authors performed immunohistochemical studies of a proliferation marker (Ki-67) with laser capture microdissection to identify specific cell types with evidence of impaired cell cycling in the stroma of PCOS endometrium. 
 
Oh, itâ€™s a brave new world that has such a Prospero in it to order the genes into pathways that can be ranked in importance, so that a tiny fraction of them can be tested for expression, and then even fewer proteins selected such that a clear story of a relatively silent endometrium unfolds! But Prospero had his own agenda (which, for example, markedly conflicted with Calibanâ€™s). Similarly both the statistical methods and the pathways chosen for further study (as well as the type and extent of further study of gene expression and protein) are subject to a certain amount of investigative license. We would have chosen other pathways for confirmation by laser capture, for example the kinesins, which are not only motoring proteins but can regulate a variety of cell signaling pathways and functional pathways such as androgen and insulin action, cell growth, and proliferation. 
 
There are multiple unsupervised modeling methods that they could have selected for analyzing the microarray data, beyond the hierarchical method done here, including partitional, graph-based, model-based, and biclustering methods that may have yielded varying results (5). Inevitably, claims of better and newer methods of hierarchical clustering than the ones used in this study have emerged (6,7). Each of these analysis methods makes certain assumptions; for example, in this paper the enrichment method looks for genes within a pathway that are highly correlated or anticorrelated between phenotypes (7). What if the pathways are grayer and the changes in genes in a certain pathway are not coexpressed (8)? What if there is discrepant expression and protein data, i.e. message is down-regulated because protein is up? Certainly more extensive characterization of proteins would shore up the story. 
 
We confess perhaps greater knowledge of Shakespeare and Huxley than the computational methods used. But we do understand some numbers. Can a meaningful analysis be performed in a case-control study when the number in each group is 4? If we were measuring sex steroids, ultrasound parameters of the ovary, or bumps on the head with a n of 4, the study would not see the light of day. With such numbers, the chance for a false-positive is large, reflected in the unacceptably high false discovery rate of many of the highlighted pathways in the analysis. But every new technology has its grace period. 
 
An adequate ample size and replication, as genomewide genetic association studies indicate, are the â€œgold standardâ€; thus, it is unfortunate that two thirds of such a small starting sample size went toward confirmatory studies, but we acknowledge that the extensive postarray studies are also a significant strength of this study. Although it is too soon to expect such exploratory studies of the endometrium to have sample sizes in the thousands, we await confirmation of the key finding of systemic down-regulation of signaling pathways in the endometrium of women with PCOS by other groups with larger sample sizes. 
 
In the meantime, we will continue to express some Huxleyian skepticism about the ability of a mathematical construct to herd such extensive and diverse data from so few individuals into meaningful patterns, while marveling at the pageant presented.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Richard S Legro"", ids = ""6133498""); list(name = ""Jan M.

Although IVF has achieved worldwide use, with approximately 339,685 bovine embryos transferred in 2010 alone, there are still continuing difficulties with efficiency. It is rare to have more than 40% of fertilized in vitro cattle oocytes reach blastocyst stage by day 8 of culture, and pregnancy rates are reported as less than 45% for in vitro produced embryos. To investigate potential influences in-vitro fertilization (IVF) has on embryonic development, this study compares in vivo- and in vitro-derived bovine blastocysts at a similar stage and quality grade (expanded, excellent quality) to determine the degree of transcriptomic variation beyond morphology using RNA-Seq.ResultsA total of 26,906,451 and 38,184,547 fragments were sequenced for in vitro and in vivo embryo pools, respectively. We detected expression for a total of 17,634 genes, with 793 genes showing differential expression between the two embryo populations with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. There were also 395 novel transcribed units found, of which 45 were differentially expressed (FDR < 0.05). In addition, 4,800 genes showed evidence of alternative splicing, with 873 genes displaying differential alternative splicing between the two pools (FDR < 0.05). Using GO enrichment analysis, multiple biological pathways were found to be significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.01), including cholesterol and sterol synthesis, system development, and cell differentiation.ConclusionsThus, our results support that IVF may influence at the transcriptomic level and that morphology is limited in full characterization of bovine preimplantation embryos.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ashley M.

ca72ff0989351fe55ff377cbf1bf982906e58702,Proteomic genotyping of fingermark donors with genetically variant peptides.,"Proteomic genotyping detects single amino acid polymorphisms to infer the genotype of corresponding non-synonymous SNPs. Like any DNA genotype, these inferences can be used to estimate random match probability. Fingermarks are a common source of biological evidence that is sample limited and a highly variable source of identifying DNA. Genetically variant peptides from fingermarks, that contain single amino acid polymorphisms, are an additional source of identifying genetic information. To discover these peptide biomarkers epidermal corneocytes from 9 subjects were isolated, processed, digested with trypsin and applied to mass spectrometry. The resulting proteomic and matching exome datasets were used to discover, characterize and validate 60 genetically variant peptides. An average of 28.8â€‰Â±â€‰4.4 genetically variant peptides were detected from each subject resulting in a total of 264 SNP allele inferences with 260 true and 4 false positives, a false discovery rate of 1.5%. Random match probabilities were estimated using the genotype frequencies from the matching major populations in the 1000 Genomes Project. Estimates ranged up to a value of 1 in 1.7â€‰Ã—â€‰108, with a median probability of 1 in 2.4â€‰Ã—â€‰106. Furthermore, the proteomically-inferred genotypes are likely to be compatible with the STR-based random match probability estimates since the closest STR locus was 2.2 Mb from the nearest GVP-inferred SNP. This project represents a novel mode of genetic information that can be obtained from fingermarks and has the potential to complement other methods of human identification including analysis of ridge patterns or touch DNA.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Trevor Borja"", ids = ""148183143""); list(name = ""Noreen Karim"", ids = ""97793442""); list(name = ""Zachary C Goecker"", ids = ""12573712""); list(name = ""Michelle R.

0ee95bccb92872b758113bcd628e023be3bfe947,Model-Based Approach to FDR Estimation,"False Discovery Rate (FDR) has become commonly used in multiple comparisons, in part driven by studies involving large numbers of parameters, e.g. microarray data analysis. FDR is a philosophically different approach from traditional hypothesis testing, and it offers a conceptually consistent framework for multiple hypothesis testing when the primary objective focuses on discovery instead of testing. In this case, traditional family-wise-error-rate control type procedures tend to be conservative. In this paper, we propose a model-based method to estimate FDR for independent hypothesis testing, and simulation study shows that the proposed method performs significantly better than existing methods. keyword: Bootstrap; Microarray; False discovery rate; Multiple hypothesis testing; Multiple comparisons; Simultaneous inference âˆ—Corresponding author, â€  Contribute equally",2004,,"list(name = ""Zhong Guan"", ids = ""144408606""); list(name = ""Baolin Wu"", ids = ""1747559"")",f30720140aeb86d516b24490f7081cdfd93efe43; 1c05911ad65a98aba1b55e7b12d1ed66a51af1f8; 8c3cba7d82780f893c88873cbc4ac9c2a48e1b09; d46cb66d6ea4ede69758ca1641708473858ab125; 4f2b48d49c81233aba44396af5b9848f04ed283d,acd7d08468e6dd7234d474860ab64d5a33cacfdc; 0b3bf78d63374eec590204de72d36aa75722278d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 5b16c66b0fe36a1f05e4fdb086c23b31cae40f12; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; bdfb57141b2141095ed942b28be24808aeba8d54,,,

Metabolomics has been shown as an effective tool to study various biological and biomedical phenotypes, whereas interrogating the inherently noisy metabolite concentration data with limited sample size remains a major challenge. Accumulating evidence suggests that metabolites' structures are relevant to their bioactivities.


RESULTS
We present a new strategy to boost the statistical power of hypothesis testing in metabolomics by incorporating quantitative molecular descriptors for each metabolite. The strategy selects potentially informative summary molecular descriptors and outputs chemical structure-informed false discovery rates. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by both simulation studies and a real application. In a metabolomic study on Alzheimer's disease, the posterior inclusion probability for summary molecular descriptors reaches 0.97. By incorporating the structure data, our approach uniquely identifies multiple Alzheimer's disease signatures, which are consistent with existing evidence. These results evidently suggest the value of the proposed approach for metabolomic hypothesis-testing problems.

0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc,Correlation and large-scale simultaneous significance testing,"Large-scale hypothesis testing problems, with hundreds or thousands of test statistics zi to consider at once, have become familiar in current practice. Applications of popular analysis methods, such as false discovery rate techniques, do not require independence of the zi's, but their accuracy can be compromised in high-correlation situations. This article presents computational and theoretical methods for assessing the size and effect of correlation in large-scale testing. A simple theory leads to the identification of a single omnibus measure of correlation for the zi's order statistic. The theory relates to the correct choice of a null distribution for simultaneous significance testing and its effect on inference.",2005,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Bradley Efron"", ids = ""2550392"")",e2a187c6ec22b531a438bfa65b679b9a1a87597d;

d1db4d8384474492d368407de59dcf56af73d256,Genetic factors for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in Japanese individuals.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Although genetic epidemiologic studies have implicated several genetic variants as risk factors for ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, the genetic determinants of these conditions remain largely unknown. We performed an association study to identify gene polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to atherothrombotic cerebral infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.


METHODS
The study population comprised 3432 unrelated Japanese individuals: 1362 stroke patients (822 with atherothrombotic cerebral infarction, 333 with intracerebral hemorrhage, and 207 with subarachnoid hemorrhage) and 2070 controls. The genotypes for 50 polymorphisms of 38 candidate genes were determined by a method that combines the polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes with suspension array technology.


RESULTS
An initial chi(2) test (false discovery rate <0.05) and subsequent multivariable logistic-regression analysis with adjustment for conventional risk factors (P<0.05) revealed that the -14C-->T polymorphism (rs1800977) of ABCA1, the A-->C (rs3027898) and C-->T (Ser532Leu, rs1059703) polymorphisms of IRAK1, and the G-->C (Cys2229Ser) polymorphism (rs619203) of ROS1 were significantly associated with atherothrombotic cerebral infarction; that the -428G-->A polymorphism (rs710968) of LIMK1 was significantly associated with intracerebral hemorrhage; and that the 13989A-->G (Ile118Val) polymorphism (NC_000007.12) of CYP3A4 was significantly associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage.


CONCLUSIONS
Genotypes for ABCA1, IRAK1, and ROS1 may prove useful for assessment of the genetic risk for atherothrombotic cerebral infarction, whereas those for LIMK1 and CYP3A4 may be similarly beneficial in assessment of the genetic risk for intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, respectively. Validation of these findings will require additional studies with independent subject panels.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711""); list(name = ""Norifumi Metoki"", ids = ""6157218""); list(name = ""Hidemi Yoshida"", ids = ""35118819""); list(name = ""Kei Satoh"", ids = ""49245021""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Takeshi Hibino"", ids = ""4383355""); list(name = ""Kiyoshi Yokoi"", ids = ""2332668""); list(name = ""Sachiro Watanabe"", ids = ""66974556""); list(name = ""Sahoko Ichihara"", ids = ""143960626""); list(name = ""Yukitoshi Aoyagi"", ids = ""5446851""); list(name = ""Akitomo Yasunaga"", ids = ""49604366""); list(name = ""Hyuntae Park"", ids = ""5960110""); list(name = ""Masashi Tanaka"", ids = ""2065043""); list(name = ""Yoshinori Nozawa"", ids = ""3526189"")",7e925607e263bc2b165f6edd7cdaf169f56a523d; 4d19ea8489f365719eaa55fa8df8a9c82bbd0428; 1848546eb3ab980bd862cccc7b11414ef13b19e3; e0d14504971aaa47457d8318a4977281ca7c8a72; 70429da52d15343fab46f9969b2fbeddcd713c3f; b1ed521d6218a5c7031945bf0bc47e683da1792c; 09485aec53066c7447d631f0fdcb3427cff82ca6; 8aaf135c2bc5496198fab7c01ec2032627e033cb; 612acabbed8498c1aed3060cf1d954d686399f3d; cd8e8355352b0a9b43bd5b173bc09977daf2b00c; 9d6416155283aea35fa14cb586d5f8ecdfaf6abc; 8877b6d8d3873d6103f66537dfa6f75d35568c81; 7711e246aff523724679dd66de08e9143448773a; c26cbe3e5e3106e912d0385fcb43fa7fcbb825b2; dcba6ca27de1af07f5eecdd73e9891677327d3e8; df4e5be214e2f65ce2c202341b681a13d48e723f; 4ce4aaa63a1f04566e412251f2506efdb699f8c4; 2b363a916385357cd381e511a80828b9b4d7dfcf; cd60881f8b8a4d7f7ad48f15ca0d83445d06b0cf; 66c373ab3cefed2b40c1f879530eeb17e67c1a8d; 2c3d0bbff540fc42204e85ef7ac233510176045d; 17d19d3f057831a5da643e8a552f070a6da223ef; 5279eb4063782abca20b0f90fd34e21a993689af; 77f2700c1ea3566d5c66f23f39f49c869d15aa15; 9db2fa6c1c395618070344a3b22b5fda06665c23; fc104d274df5c21cd6124b4530db418939d4ea6d; 506388f9a8e10d8f6def45598297cdf1ccd88435; f039d81c44c5e3177c5ea2480c944d319db67145; 910b44f6554a2b2e0d621dd1fb4c99ab35d397e1; a60855c8169802c7a3d8d18988bf6e583e99ded4; 6e2c08c7c17951b1e40f6357d39573dff71122ff; 26490d36ddf87e9eccf37f25bc943c61b1474beb; 657e6eb7ecc341be5f557d08c9347642ea3e1313,c5c2a0bef5c257f18ee7c69d77872dc551f8ed18; 7a48eb91773277f9a88c33f3cce8855e67730f2a; 0682d818153ff3f6b21a5a7834cac44bc40e0ae3; 62a484088e4e550dbcb63a9726c6cabc950a64d4; 2db4aaf813314d7ccca91c4c915217549d6ae37c; 5ff5af3b4479477209ef078f9d91016e24c8745d; 4b669b0394c7408b79ec0198822554cd5c6a9ae0; 1d6e0321893c22f82a41cb1c594769d599d45de0; 6aee090eabde0192ed8b97b0913782c00ce2eb5c; 93347179043fcab967bd813b853cb301905e247d; 8c402f7ca734761a6890ec13ed797a0d303f3dc5; 6b6d28f1d30dc1e1f08adfdbcc1f66a7864a86ad; 0dbe25a416f11d81f3423f9ccc6f17ac2fc14aa5; 8bb33aed87bed6758a46f72395bcc5e2e8c8cf11; aee5cb5bab2d213f7d2c4d490b35e98137e6f5dc; 857e34b82b490c1534c1f6894240ec87b920d947; 0d08041ab41108cfcfb1d8e8d9d7482195e8ae8f; be257b9c52ee59b3fccc71272e3049e1ed55a21b; 924a2b848f27db3e6fb14fe05cc26cca711b0ca2; 3d2c5d37099fdbdebaba08a8682ba8b64b12e932; 21b44aa4e622cf3253081ffc6eee96b703ffb4c7; caf06b90fb03e669a3791edeed2863c2b72c4214; 15d34f4dbc6c4e061f0dfd34d4ee0184e793bde3; 8b0ac87bd6b81c660639f5c99523002cd76300b1; 14f4dbfa57cb774df163c077af34d51be99ee29b; 53afa2f84838c4dac67e6b327b1e77888934a2e4; a05862378823c65216037744147474f7a0a2edea; 4ad306d1e1847547fae979b4fac6e014aa652216; ea72df0020c002b48dbfe11b88d1b462aee01ec1; f67f710d2078297a5627c29ae6524d11562a89c1; 460eb24a85b94e8230a51b588fd018ddabbee83d; 0dfb05c5a09faf08dbc92a10ef940e27fa5d7b97; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f1494a595da5938f4383a0b8aad66c31de2f07bd; a65f38773dcd7cabdf3772ee414d485557a40465,Stroke,39 8,"

5fc448c94e9360579f653411878b8b3ffa133e33,Xanthine oxidase gene variants and their association with blood pressure and incident hypertension: a population study.,"OBJECTIVE
The enzyme xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) generates uric acid in the terminal steps of the purine metabolism; meanwhile reactive oxygen species are formed. We hypothesized that uric acid production, as assessed indirectly from XOR variants, is associated with hypertension.


METHODS
Among 2769 participants (48.3% men; mean age 40.7 years) randomly recruited from European populations, we genotyped 25 tagging XOR SNPs and measured blood pressure (BP) at baseline and follow-up (median 8.8 years). The relation between variants of the XOR gene with changes in pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure over time; and incidence of hypertension, were analyzed.


RESULTS
Compared with nonminor allele carriers, pulse pressure increased approximately 2â€ŠmmHg more in minor allele carriers of rs11904439 (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.01), whereas mean arterial pressure and DBP increased approximately 1â€ŠmmHg less in minor allele carriers of rs2043013 (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.01). In 2050, participants normotensive at baseline, hazard ratios contrasting risk of hypertension in minor allele carriers vs. nonminor allele carriers were 1.31 (95% confidence interval 1.03-1.68; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.02) and 1.69 (95% confidence interval 1.11-2.57; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.01) for rs11904439 and rs148756340, respectively. With the false discovery rate set at 0.25, the aforementioned associations retained significance. The changes in SBP from baseline to follow-up and the serum levels of uric acid at baseline (nâ€Š=â€Š1949) were not associated with XOR.


CONCLUSION

4a6b8730416978944ff0b4beab946147af11f4a5,False negative control for multiple acceptance-support hypotheses testing problem,"Hypothesis tests can be categorized as rejection-support tests or acceptance-support tests. Type I error in a rejection-support test has the same effect as type II error in an acceptance-support test. Most hypothesis testing is based on type I error control, but it increases type II error. Similar to how researchers control type I error when performing multiple rejection tests, researchers might want to control type II error in multiple acceptance-support testing. In this thesis, I discuss various methods to control decision errors in multiple testing. As an example, I conduct multiple normality tests with four different normality formulae under four different alternative hypotheses. I discuss estimation of the ratio between the null hypothesis and non-discovery rate, and also balance the trade-off between false discovery rate and non-discovery rate to find more cost-effective critical points. I apply this discussion to real data about breast cancer.

2f1149885ee9670f54e2b6e29380a5158475c36b,Rates of TP53 Mutation are Significantly Elevated in African American Patients with Gastric Cancer,"BackgroundGastric adenocarcinoma is a heterogenous disease that results from complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors, which may contribute to the disparate outcomes observed between different patient populations. This study aimed to determine whether genomic differences exist in a diverse population of patients by evaluating tumor mutational profiles stratified by race.MethodsAll patients with gastric adenocarcinoma between 2012 and 2016 who underwent targeted next-generation sequencing of cancer genes by the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets platform were identified. Patient race was categorized as Asian, African American, Hispanic, or Caucasian. Fisherâ€™s exact test was used to examine differences in mutation rates between racial designations for the most common mutations identified. The p values in this study were adjusted using the false discovery rate method.ResultsThe study investigated 595 mutations in 119 patients. The DNA alterations identified included missense mutations (66%), frame-shift deletions (13%), and nonsense mutations (9%). Silent mutations were excluded. The most frequently mutated genes were ARID1A, CDH1, ERBB3, KRAS, PIK3CA, and TP53. Of these, TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene, affecting 50% of patients. The proportion of patients with TP53 mutations differed significantly between races (pâ€‰=â€‰0.012). The findings showed TP53 mutations for 89% (16/18) of the African American patients, 56% (10/18) of the Asian patients, 43% (9/21) of the Hispanic patients, and 40% (25/62) of the Caucasian patients.ConclusionsSignificantly higher rates of TP53 mutations were identified among the African American patients with gastric adenocarcinoma.

d8604d7061dff146ac8694ecc428ca896b2842e6,Topographic diversity of structural connectivity in schizophrenia,"The neurobiological heterogeneity of schizophrenia is widely accepted, but it is unclear how mechanistic differences converge to produce the observed phenotype. Establishing a pathophysiological model that accounts for both neurobiological heterogeneity and phenotypic similarity is essential to inform stratified treatment approaches. In this cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging study, we recruited 77 healthy controls, and 70 patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia. We first confirmed the heterogeneity in structural connectivity by showing a reduced between-individual similarity of the structural connectivity in patients compared to healthy controls. Second, at a system level, we found the diversity of the topographic distribution of the strength of structural connectivity was significantly reduced in patients (Pâ€¯=â€¯7.21â€¯Ã—â€¯10-7, T142â€¯=â€¯5.19 [95% CI: 3.37-7.52], Cohen's dâ€¯=â€¯0.91), and this affected 65 of the 90 brain regions examined (False Discovery Rate <5%). Third, when topographic diversity was used as a discriminant feature to train a model for classifying patients from controls, it significantly improved the accuracy on an independent sample (T99â€¯=â€¯5.54; Pâ€¯<â€¯0.001). These findings suggest a highly individualized pattern of structural dysconnectivity underlies the heterogeneity of schizophrenia, but these disruptions likely converge on an emergent common pathway to generate the clinical phenotype of the disorder.",2020,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hongtao Ruan"", ids = ""38973180""); list(name = ""Qiang Luo"", ids = ""73287920""); list(name = ""Lena Palaniyappan"", ids = ""50651403""); list(name = ""Wenlian Lu"", ids = ""1723706""); list(name = ""Jianfeng Feng"", ids = ""145775107"")",,,Schizophrenia Research,215,181-189
41b361232db8e4d1aa96778804bfbb6922feee95,MOST: most-similar ligand based approach to target prediction,"BackgroundMany computational approaches have been used for target prediction, including machine learning, reverse docking, bioactivity spectra analysis, and chemical similarity searching. Recent studies have suggested that chemical similarity searching may be driven by the most-similar ligand. However, the extent of bioactivity of most-similar ligands has been oversimplified or even neglected in these studies, and this has impaired the prediction power.ResultsHere we propose the MOst-Similar ligand-based Target inference approach, namely MOST, which uses fingerprint similarity and explicit bioactivity of the most-similar ligands to predict targets of the query compound. Performance of MOST was evaluated by using combinations of different fingerprint schemes, machine learning methods, and bioactivity representations. In sevenfold cross-validation with a benchmark Ki dataset from CHEMBL release 19 containing 61,937 bioactivity data of 173 human targets, MOST achieved high average prediction accuracy (0.95 for pKiâ€‰â‰¥â€‰5, and 0.87 for pKiâ€‰â‰¥â€‰6). Morgan fingerprint was shown to be slightly better than FP2. Logistic Regression and Random Forest methods performed better than NaÃ¯ve Bayes. In a temporal validation, the Ki dataset from CHEMBL19 were used to train models and predict the bioactivity of newly deposited ligands in CHEMBL20. MOST also performed well with high accuracy (0.90 for pKiâ€‰â‰¥â€‰5, and 0.76 for pKiâ€‰â‰¥â€‰6), when Logistic Regression and Morgan fingerprint were employed. Furthermore, the p values associated with explicit bioactivity were found be a robust index for removing false positive predictions. Implicit bioactivity did not offer this capability. Finally, p values generated with Logistic Regression, Morgan fingerprint and explicit activity were integrated with a false discovery rate (FDR) control procedure to reduce false positives in multiple-target prediction scenario, and the success of this strategy it was demonstrated with a case of fluanisone. In the case of aloe-emodinâ€™s laxative effect, MOST predicted that acetylcholinesterase was the mechanism-of-action target; in vivo studies validated this prediction.ConclusionsUsing the MOST approach can result in highly accurate and robust target prediction. Integrated with a FDR control procedure, MOST provides a reliable framework for multiple-target inference.

364271203b7bc65bfcf762bd2454c08e559413b0,False Discovery Rate for Functional Data,"Since Benjamini and Hochberg introduced false discovery rate (FDR) in their seminal paper, this has become a very popular approach to the multiple comparisons problem. An increasingly popular topic within functional data analysis is local inference, i.e., the continuous statistical testing of a null hypothesis along the domain. The principal issue in this topic is the infinite amount of tested hypotheses, which can be seen as an extreme case of the multiple comparisons problem. In this paper we define and discuss the notion of false discovery rate in a very general functional data setting. Moreover, a continuous version of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure is introduced along with a definition of adjusted p-value function. Some general conditions are stated, under which the functional Benjamini-Hochberg procedure provides control of the functional FDR. Two different simulation studies are presented; the first study has a one-dimensional domain and a comparison with another state of the art method, and the second study has a planar two-dimensional domain. Finally, the proposed method is applied to satellite measurements of Earth temperature. In detail, we aim at identifying the regions of the planet where temperature has significantly increased in the last decades.

0a6eaaab3b9583c02a465f86af5dc407b2afe8a3,Genome scale transcriptome analysis of shoot organogenesis in Populus,"BackgroundOur aim is to improve knowledge of gene regulatory circuits important to dedifferentiation, redifferentiation, and adventitious meristem organization during in vitro regeneration of plants. Regeneration of transgenic cells remains a major obstacle to research and commercial deployment of most taxa of transgenic plants, and woody species are particularly recalcitrant. The model woody species Populus, due to its genome sequence and amenability to in vitro manipulation, is an excellent species for study in this area. The genes recognized may help to guide the development of new tools for improving the efficiency of plant regeneration and transformation.ResultsWe analyzed gene expression during poplar in vitro dedifferentiation and shoot regeneration using an Affymetrix array representing over 56,000 poplar transcripts. We focused on callus induction and shoot formation, thus we sampled RNAs from tissues: prior to callus induction, 3 days and 15 days after callus induction, and 3 days and 8 days after the start of shoot induction. We used a female hybrid white poplar clone (INRA 717-1 B4, Populus tremula Ã— P. alba) that is used widely as a model transgenic genotype. Approximately 15% of the monitored genes were significantly up-or down-regulated when controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at 0.01; over 3,000 genes had a 5-fold or greater change in expression. We found a large initial change in expression after the beginning of hormone treatment (at the earliest stage of callus induction), and then a much smaller number of additional differentially expressed genes at subsequent regeneration stages. A total of 588 transcription factors that were distributed in 45 gene families were differentially regulated. Genes that showed strong differential expression included components of auxin and cytokinin signaling, selected cell division genes, and genes related to plastid development and photosynthesis. When compared with data on in vitro callogenesis in Arabidopsis, 25% (1,260) of up-regulated and 22% (748) of down-regulated genes were in common with the genes regulated in poplar during callus induction.ConclusionThe major regulatory events during plant cell organogenesis occur at early stages of dedifferentiation. The regulatory circuits reflect the combinational effects of transcriptional control and hormone signaling, and associated changes in light environment imposed during dedifferentiation.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yanghuan Bao"", ids = ""46933051""); list(name = ""Palitha Dharmawardhana"", ids = ""144108880""); list(name = ""Todd C.

b9d28c1e96673f12472bfb8f0e33edad4938a74a,"Association of GSTP1, COMT, and TPMT with testicular cancer (TC) treatment outcome after cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CBCT).","344 Background: Genetic variation in GSTP1, COMT, and TPMT, which are genes important to the metabolism of cisplatin, may affect TC treatment outcome. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of these genes causing increased cisplatin metabolism may be associated with worse treatment outcome.


METHODS
TC patients who had CBCT, â‰¥ 1 year of follow-up since initiation of CBCT, and genotyping completed as part of a genome-wide association study were included. After excluding markers with genotyping call rates of < 90%, we analyzed 3, 43, and 44 SNPs each for GSTP1, COMT, and TPMT respectively. We evaluated three endpoints: refractory disease (RD) as defined by radiographic or serologic evidence of TC after initial CBCT; progression-free survival (PFS); and overall survival (OS). We studied SNP association with these endpoints assuming additive, recessive, and dominant genetic models and adjusted p-values for false discovery rate to account for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
137 patients (82.5% white, median age of 31 years) were recruited. Among them, 81.7% had non-seminoma and 68.6%, 8.0% and 22.6% were in good, intermediate, and poor IGCCC prognostic group respectively. 33.6%, 62.0%, 0.7%, and 2.9% had EP, BEP, TIP, and VIP respectively as initial CBCT with a mean total cisplatin dose of 345.3 mg/m2. After initial CBCT, 8.0% developed RD; among the remaining 92.0%, 23.8% had recurrent TC after a mean follow-up of 46.8 months. We found no statistically significant associations of our SNPs with PFS or OS. However, the COMT rs2073743 G allele conferred a higher risk of RF. It was present in 40.9% of patients with RD versus 21.1% of those without. Assuming recessive inheritance, patients with rs2073743 GG had over 20-fold increased odds (odds ratio = 22.69, (95% CI 3.3 - 155.8) ) of RD compared to those who carry at least one C allele. After adjusting for race, IGCCC, primary site of disease, type of CBCT, and total cisplatin dose, this association was no longer statistically significant.


CONCLUSIONS
COMT rs2073743 may be associated with RD, but replication and validation studies will be imperative to confirm this finding.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chunkit Fung"", ids = ""22144437""); list(name = ""David J.

To identify potential new mammalian GSD genes, we used the Mouse Genome 430v2.0 GeneChip to analyze gene expression differences between XX and XY SSCs cells isolated from the gonads of embryonic day (E) 13 C57BL/6J fetuses carrying an EGFP reporter transgene expressed specifically in SSCs. In addition, genome wide expression differences between XX and XY E13 whole gonads were examined. Analysis revealed that XX and XY E13 SSCs differentially express 647 transcripts (False Discovery Rate cutoff 1%), including transcripts not previously reported to exhibit a sexually dimorphic expression pattern in this unique cell population. Enrichment for genes controlling cell proliferation was noted in XY SSCs, whereas enrichment for genes controlling cell morphology and metabolic status was identified in XX SSCs.

c36ce62ee5931d919852c1439a08e4b5cbaf1ae4,Involvement of c-myc-regulated genes in hepatocellular carcinoma related to genotype-C hepatitis B virus,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the molecular basis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) caused by genotype-C hepatitis B virus (HBV). Methods: We compared molecular profiles of 15 HCCs and five non-tumorous livers, all of which were associated with genotype-C HBV infection, using DNA microarray technology. Results: Our supervised learning identified 237 genes whose expression differed between HCCs and non-tumorous livers. This result was validated by a false discovery rate of 0%. Levels of expression of 35 and 202 genes were higher and lower, respectively, in HCCs than in non-tumorous livers. Among the 237 genes, we highlighted the top 35 upregulated and top 35 downregulated genes in tumor. Interestingly, when overlapping genes were excluded, 12 (e.g., NM23-H2, MCM7, PARP1, YWHAH, HSPB1, and MSH2) of the top 34 upregulated genes and five (e.g., MT1A and MT3) of the top 33 downregulated genes were c-myc-regulated genes. The microarray data for five randomly selected genes (MCM7, UBE2L3, PPIA, CXCL12, and ASS) were confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Conclusions: Our results indicate that many c-myc-regulated genes are involved in genotype-C-HBV-related HCC, suggesting that c-myc is related to the hepatocarcinogenic activity of genotype-C HBV.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Norio Iizuka"", ids = ""1783939""); list(name = ""Ryouichi Tsunedomi"", ids = ""4601558""); list(name = ""Takao Tamesa"", ids = ""6235292""); list(name = ""Toshimasa Okada"", ids = ""47183054""); list(name = ""Kazuhiko Sakamoto"", ids = ""145813777""); list(name = ""Takashi Hamaguchi"", ids = ""48348761""); list(name = ""Hisafumi Yamada-Okabe"", ids = ""1398842902""); list(name = ""Takanobu Miyamoto"", ids = ""47234380""); list(name = ""Shunji Uchimura"", ids = ""1798048""); list(name = ""Yoshihiko Hamamoto"", ids = ""1780236""); list(name = ""Masaaki Oka"", ids = ""144757336"")",f5c6e0d2fe6aac5131ddcd126dbfccdbc6a8d1f5; af06e3a8fb9d9125334b066309175fea31425704; 631cb3a06bb65e0508f340a989a04d5a539d1923; 881bd31f0fed41dd8984d2615799cc79d3fa6d55; 26308f2f1fc8f8a3f52eab0c1884d0b5f16fc4a2; c864e2c43708218013184bfa32259c85ee740b92; 448f114d80329039873f4b15f4042aef3ec0c982; 0431c93e2f011ff7923644edec4bc96e5b043ae8; 31024e6a301c93ceb167d2a2eba2ddbfc15983cc; deac710d8b82e266d439bbb110bc50e9e2b0e826; 72ed699005f8861c43a93950044430db33ba11c9; 15de8e2aed266249d8bfd86118059f091bfb5ab2; 082d8bac86c106007c08c09f908a5f0fde393e96; 0df33221b030e4c4fd4e42308357c7dcdaca6c68; 93aca6f3c14ce932e6ebeec7272493a35c892918; 4c287870dd4da90283fa6f8d6fd6fa9d3694126f; 16a2187b9ac011703ab03ed26a798452f4f7a8fe; a90a0fbcb9dc93e82a9bea48a6b0c0b1f1187eb9; a5997c0ffbb1fff57d94f87fef8d0619aa0710c0; 1656d8918d36bbed6c5762c588dd2385a24d564a; 34ce66b081f95c4ccf2997141bbe6828c67dba86; acfec61dac6dd66b2adf40a586bb75ae06a1d42b; 124e699a26f470325921a33131470843dc51e338; 31bb6459fc0c2722f18e5905c602d2cb8b01e518; b7c5571f7a970574a038c7fb4eb60d943a4070db,d55d400f188013bbe34eb00381f51dd1f310bc16; 1310d8237af07ef86eb61fb51ccc73a27e47f79c; bb54ad6aa46a09c4819550b4f3d504bc7cf8092f; 255c7bac4410fe2e2717a067a14260d6f57812b9; 9cd036471bfdfeeec359f274eeea665eebb45d55; 0c2968f84fcf9238f46d3fe6e08e1848bf75ad25; 9c0eca133a8a26b8f4fd6f317650b8f8bc8f43b8; d5dedba3da3e07f9c8943c0a5e9d4f55a68e70dd; 99bcd099653aa7ddc4e3f692a792b62e696b9071; 05bcd2f473706d1eedb7beda9c1cf9f48a48b5b5; 15db36ca841fb7efea7fb80f99e5cbaeb93cb60e; 37c2f613658f6d53742e46b3fc5b8cd802c334c1; 8e2b26d081c9ce9b4fb3aa75e933fb8da5359faa; b48ec3b0022279c811246b16ec454af8daafc4a6; 478e6294bc4ecd4f5a51e5a255e5b61f130a1858; 5bc9b7d774b5b181eae75dcf3ef8065fce1b6ada; f3e2ba7b1e9374aa452f4ad8bf0dda8b28e59b8e; c48ec5df4e9d8e3b303bd6773a7830281273cee4; dd30e965c732d5d0207ed8afc3c29fdb39840d43; 8bbf4ddb300c6553b0be0ff52a79ba23893ec718; 29dff675a32602582fc4caa7bb4cff1a27c41889; 79ce410e8efa8bd5eab36d5e3351f033ec8ab267; 7fb4d37e97ea80498ee836d006d3a2286895e4e8; 91ecef014294916a33369087ef4137450347909e; 9e259be19667ecbe0beebe44dee74059032bc6dc; 7b5ccecc19437d714aa9fe3f7d051a09b1190b9b; 023226909de9412baaa4e49911caaadcf751ff65; 65ac1f06437a35bc45fe354c548a2dcb314339ea; d9402889fce17532d2c899dc29f239f06f399170; f934ecf3e51b482e4d4055b75355157398970cfe; e06394311dcb4d5a98cece5c8e200fe0a621e08c; be499a65592efa2305b9ce78aad42b7a0562496c; 5d12aa0eca27735340a2ebe0953db774b4a4f896; 167d190cd82333b8b2739045aff2262e998451f9; 12df836ac44632c0f2d0b07cd580169fe788b5eb; 66a6c887d1e93a1fab691d5ffd7c4649cfaee3b4; 180c2c224dc4b1815156c831fb78b3a921c982b7; d01dd26c65fff7671975e8f7856de7b37b88ba11; 9a15d0866173fb083cf501113f2c91e71ee1bfd6; ca899e7c80096f9cbc5fca1db563e1038df3250b; 9a0f5aaf891e4eb39dcf46e609996efa02880fad; cf379092170dcadb176532b1499ac340abffe6ab; 16422228a345b43627571294c69e74c6bf2a1620; d3fc45120340c24918a75bde1fb3435c079390eb; c82b81545e8723ecd03aa1b7778a80cdc7c34ded; 0f1d66f5282cd6b80f31b977f9e2e1531dd1b334; 70c625ca5c934edfe4ac1e88d56c03654f10529c; 7502f8729cda0963bf7c65d5506241951ad3860c,Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology,132,473-481
bf8a7cf0e574532a4eed882d680691958f3f06ee,Poplar CBF1 functions specifically in an integrated cold regulatory network,"The C-repeat binding factors (CBFs), also termed dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 1 (DREB1) family members, play crucial roles in the acquisition of stress tolerance, but in trees, the underlying mechanisms of stress tolerance remain elusive. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we isolated five CBF1 orthologs from four poplar sections (Populus spp.) and assessed their expression under drought, cold, heat and salt stress conditions. Globally induced expression in response to cold suggested a correlation between poplar CBF1 expression and the acquisition of cold tolerance. Responses that varied between sections may reflect section-specific stress tolerance mechanisms, suggesting an effect of ecological context on the development of CBF1-mediated stress tolerance in poplar. We then used a genome-wide search strategy in Populus trichocarpa to predict 2263 putative CBF target genes; the identified genes participate in multiple biological processes and pathways. Almost all of the putative target genes contained multiple cis-acting elements that mediate responses to various environmental and endogenous signals, consistent with an important role of CBF1s in an integrated cold regulatory network. Finally, analysis of an association population of 528 individuals of Populus simonii identified six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (false discovery rate Q < 0.10) significantly (P < 0.005) associated with malondialdehyde production and electrolyte leakage, suggesting the potential importance of PsCBF1 in the regulation of some membrane-related functions. Our findings provide new insights into the function of PsCBF1 and shed light on the CBF-mediated regulatory network in poplar.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ying Li"", ids = ""48513767""); list(name = ""Yuepeng Song"", ids = ""6045215""); list(name = ""Baohua Xu"", ids = ""48310149""); list(name = ""Jianbo Xie"", ids = ""134233706""); list(name = ""Deqiang Zhang"", ids = ""39687013"")",22f5d732633eb57be01fbffc723b28af74794a51; 9e0717f33ae85bbf105ffb4b886a78e7dd60e136; eed26a0286d8c226bcfcd9bff1270738de6093cf; 7c16abd30ea0f8ff41f879bd0ccd8ca1e83c56a4,552548ca9f42f6815c23d6acb4013934b7710dc4; f8629e0ffe4c9ed0835c3a1ff559d24b44fbffe0; cd775ccaecec36f4b78ced94430bbf008e7d9d05; 22bd8a24f56a8f3602ed152a32f50a23167790bf; 4c40c3d3c4d4668443dca1885bb38cb6674b4b66; c8692bfcefd966ecc78146164758fea24f875d99; 9e764ea2d9c11867cebda75566ef91b6db0dea66; c5ef5f7782418ba4b9d7ca19b47252614bf61674; a6945d0b72e4f0f29993e0604e70be05eb26be33; 2a27c8e9550a93a4923fdeb026add08591678898; 5d7ee0307762f1ce1ab85df4f21cd862f544c43a; 49ecbdd58d613fc92dcff5a775fc588802f5b761; 0e451fddf2419afa684d34d7be434362d6180404; 3fd027618552891a00d3958518f79cbae1337dd2; beb833d16c0d3cc82db16b07771dfe07bd050503; 17aa91017a2bdd3dc06352ff6731ff42f1bd523a; 58ab375bdfaa4863899ab3e8ca0412d24fb3542b; 9706693fbf62f0f09f6c9e81c603385fb1b30024; 0e57b34c22df75a1ac33bdbc0b7943ee413b5c32; 72ce6d7fed4e1fd07b2c87a7aa6a63d86e5e661a; 53b9dfd0d72f94dba9ff1706297f999923b3e3f6; be63f2b289d7edcb525cad50af418d134f7615cc; 7a72db3f1fc28b4dbd3a06a9530bb7a8c15dea41; b33c3c2c2c56cc406f0701d0e786f6382247a1f5; 2c7dbc4225eddf4d00dd46ff5f8df683130a4971; ea3db91306fe387d4d404215d802c0bb958313a5; 593ce127017f7cfc343be971f1ba9579a1408999; 423792549edf1c38df1ed846bdcc2aba14ae5965; 375adb91fe81bc29d37eda5c3112df93984b244f; d473c0ae6e5a43f2738110e58b7e3d83fe42ba54; e3432c2a117460e64ed706299f061c5f502ba559; 6fed012977a6b60cc3686b748c65d829e9a17c6f; cabbf07477c168fa68474afb9744f50210a3fb36; 880ad1f174f457b80e96a0cbb87ac955c2f68b15; 2702b376fc8e437a437ccb30e62bfaea5df437da; 9fc110b8665c8e1a5cb2f2d87fb81c9b2f16feec; 78572802a26648cdf9efd1ec3037b3989c0b515a; c09d3bb9c998d95c011f3abb31a2a8f7bfbc1a22; 9433adbfbdf5feb142cb344aaa9466413bf951bb; be9fbe2557ba8b332ec09b4f32d68f83f304b2b7; 2c7ccf403194086a7b59f6064aae76eb84cefb16; c18ee8e39d6bb7f695eac2894ce3f4870783f4f9; ac80db7e5599f9fc2e56fbc68230d8b12b1bc3f9; b4c69cf34916b2495c57e0d2e316edbcc11824ed; ca1dbc700b753312e6c46f9dfbaa96c97ee9e39f; 31cd85ede5c54359f076fa78d6ab6312d7a61565; 2861cce75da802bd99d9beb6d0073d4cc1eec1c8; 12c22de8b32d79a12ef584c949c4c29095da30e2; 2dfa6721666e6ffdd15d8e24cc33cd3f5eac72d4; 551e41d39bbb54271bdfdc84d0e31a5928b1ae0b,Tree Physiology,37,98â€“115
dc0d302b6559c8fe9c8faefedd31f6eb120c9312,Statistics meets Optimization: Computational guarantees for statistical learning algorithms,"Author(s): Yang, Fan | Advisor(s): Wainwright, Martin J | Abstract: Modern technological advances have prompted massive scale data collection in manymodern fields such as artificial intelligence, and traditional sciences alike. This has led toan increasing need for scalable machine learning algorithms and statistical methods to drawconclusions about the world. In all data-driven procedures, the data scientist faces thefollowing fundamental questions: How should I design the learning algorithm and how longshould I run it? Which samples should I collect for training and how many are sufficient togeneralize conclusions to unseen data? These questions relate to statistical and computational properties of both the data and the algorithm. This thesis explores their role in the areas of non-convex optimization, non-parametric estimation, active learning and multiple testing.In the first part, we provide insights of different flavor concerning theinterplay between statistical and computational properties of first-order type methods oncommon estimation procedures. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm estimatesparameters of a latent variable model by running a first-order type method on a non-convexlandscape. We identify and characterize a general class of Hidden Markov Models for whichlinear convergence of EM to a statistically optimal point is provable for a large initializationradius. For non-parametric estimation problems, functional gradient descent type (alsocalled boosting) algorithms are used to estimate the best fit in infinite dimensional functionspaces. We develop a new proof technique showing that early stopping the algorithm insteadmay also yield an optimal estimator without explicit regularization. In fact, the samekey quantities (localized complexities) are underlying both traditional penalty-based andalgorithmic regularization.In the second part of the thesis, we explore how data collected adaptively with a constantlyupdated estimation can lead to signifcant reduction in sample complexity for multiplehypothesis testing problems. In particular, we show how adaptive strategies can be usedto simultaneously control the false discovery rate over multiple tests and return the bestalternative (among many) for each test with optimal sample complexity in an online manner.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Fan Yang"", ids = ""145338249"")",,89e9c539db6ffd2cb477b314a0ac8ba593473125; 24c499f250196252626c19a56174436b08ff4f78; 4f7b2b3750392d9f315623dab573e260c527a46d; 62563cca01472b5fa11c3eda047e3bbcf3f7f6f4; b1a5961609c623fc816aaa77565ba38b25531a8e; 9924ca73b0ba56988a8a543f53bea519a8a45fe4; ccf5208521cb8c35f50ee8873df89294b8ed7292; 98fe4c4d8c80fae030c381f60a93e20be9b6f76d; 68969e3f24853d97dc4c59837e009a16f6f279d3; f7103090b0bc74106025ac96b21b6ce5d1fb569c; 603bdbb17ba1f909280405a076455ac4f878fbf3; 3092a4929bdb3d6a8fe53f162586b7431b5ff8a4; e3b7d9921955b698ca37cc8e1108d8b45cc9c6e0; 034068edbe30849e03da09ca40a08f21d24aab39; 571f5bbecd3a083a2bb6844f59a3f8cea237252e; 83a17e34882c24b4ff407f3e75525631d332df49; e838983ce6cf38e0d77019bce9a71f75a0c844f8; 10d85561e4aafc516d10064f30dff05b41f70afe; 52888f0173275ee042bd09447127f51b2f8e61cd; 4027427ddbfae986ea095c61bf0df2a4786af642; 6f6b76e957cad4e734a2b9a85d07d0c22f3457fd; e7b18110c70ccb71305dda7a973f89630ffd9879; 10179d638070a2f2381f917aeb27768b76cbe3f2; b80e2143bbe4999e83c708293e37066406534a61; 3761b503e6580ea4aadffa7f07bb8e25dc353c40; e9a7a043d2202f084be2b0e20a174b76940049e9; 730eff08764b46b174c00c4d53dbe71182bba65f; 7c63aeb09b0e0a2b20ed3154f66c9b6821132c53; ed3a2b1d571a8188f41341f9b5c675a7682792b0; 34c976240814548d87bae9526e2cd64e8f8f5041; 91db7d4aeadf9719feb3fca36f12875d4888b70a; 2522515d41aa2000e19487e26afe270fd090f4e1; 381667eec4fb626d3a5352d33aa7ee756b7cd08c; 0e619d9f15654317046721f1d4b67d5f009de2c0; 9d68c8b56a5994ee9488c66a0125af053d4f03ba; 59aa5c32fea6f166cce6ba5f8c437e1fe71f69fc; c51ded75669a7e0129cce27357158ca89d25c1ad; 8e835bd75f760f7b0138ce9c73bece4ed69b6f28; df50c6e1903b1e2d657f78c28ab041756baca86a; 3521883ea2c2c93b3af29232555be5c4fe4a2ba9; 3065c5e37a0c1f1be365e88ddf2d5cd02faa5db1; 38bb2fa3dcadf9fad63a0893f42c6d76b34ccb0e; b7294ac444ae927f71ac442372903ff5e2a763e1; 8e617b8c63dd35d9913bbc104d0666ffd10e9e6a; 072d756c8b17a78018298e67ff29e6d3a4fe5770; 237629a6c39ab09f43f997b48ad977fa8f366d85; b422a2d3ef04399c1d2135d941196613f6255f16; e9e495ff046b0da2948b1de10c9ea008804f40a5; a92684c164b0c46020a371ae5116df74bb37a412; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; d5051890e501117097eeffbd8ded87694f0d8063; 53b967ac34b5a422f81fb6947da0ba148ba90221; 9b254f1db55811168f697e3c644fee04d06979e9; 3ec6b1aeddce8c350a4f8ea3ba7ffcfd73b57ed2; 333261578494da6e257a3364a276bf6c9810a2e7; a7f5ddee3d55d628eae68653dc3b34ffcd2d2075; 2e49816e154db2c7e81f5bb5d8acc01a24626b00; 83eb8597cf14e3872ca0596f99467c0be0472012; e1d8c9d28e2a5275b5d531d678d5544bede3fdee; acd7d08468e6dd7234d474860ab64d5a33cacfdc; a010977e4460ba0b135f20f911a001a2a3d3ee43; d61540a96c22a1ed4a2b78558a2ebdd39f221a90; d98d0d1900b13b87aa4ffd6b69c046beb63f0434; 16557ed1e6bd0e43d3c2832d06665316fee23e51; 97da69876da58c096580c641ba772b84932844b1; df529f7ea1601ecd208bbc1c4b59c2b90400e2f3; f3468d705a30cac9de93392336034ee0fdaa23ff; 1240aab236e13e83954c49b4be3c086b4311b4ae; d4c8146584ecaf8d581a5cde4001f7989e42e24d; 4dc0e6599d543a5ad3c32b9127c9dac04e34021b; bdfb57141b2141095ed942b28be24808aeba8d54; 8a77f28ee6161ea799fadb4c94f848d4a7b3bb75; 12147b28efa8e949d04426c57a10f9ff1b5ad05c; ff51ed3ad05067844da8d108a666bbdd4e900501; cc394d074c8504671eb37926d14a3df4a07520a0; 5b433f3304a9628153ed91669cf9a623636adc84; bda27e969e43a1e93026981afff57b8d46be008e; 956ab419b11edd364e95f652f490728a300dc35f; ab7545c583adf9d39302bd1f1381b97d24c54b32; 27f06ebf4a52735c6df13133976178534c3c1726; 955826e76b78045138c66088d6b80c9c1f799453; 7c3e86c65a47d4948c648268caaaaa7b8cefb925; b639689cb6cbe0fa376c103f352d951628c73993; 8f937472778aee48d32bb7811569f70b78198f75; 7c4661cd866e1bd962a0962f5db9a5f21c74f4cf; de86920bd7600f40f23bc9400d891878e473dcb0; 7113dcd0fc6e750f5ded5d6eba0b1d92f3f503f3,,,
9542f16f46fec8f7afef2dc6d7eb8b7d755d7354,High-dimensional econometrics and regularized GMM,"This chapter presents key concepts and theoretical results for analyzing estimation and inference in high-dimensional models. High-dimensional models are characterized by having a number of unknown parameters that is not vanishingly small relative to the sample size. We first present results in a framework where estimators of parameters of interest may be represented directly as approximate means. Within this context, we review fundamental results including high-dimensional central limit theorems, bootstrap approximation of high-dimensional limit distributions, and moderate deviation theory. We also review key concepts underlying inference when many parameters are of interest such as multiple testing with family-wise error rate or false discovery rate control. We then turn to a general high-dimensional minimum distance framework with a special focus on generalized method of moments problems where we present results for estimation and inference about model parameters. The presented results cover a wide array of econometric applications, and we discuss several leading special cases including high-dimensional linear regression and linear instrumental variables models to illustrate the general results.",2018,Mathematics;

a930c745205fbc805ae30fa085c7be44d0402d6f,Critical Role for DOCK2 in CD8 + /TCR âˆ’ Graft Facilitating Cells Enhancing Engraftment of Hematopoietic Stem Cells,"Abstract 142 CD8 + /TCR âˆ’ graft facilitating cells (FC) have a potent capability to facilitate relatively small numbers of highly purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in both allogeneic and syngeneic recipients. The mechanisms by which FC promote HSC engraftment have not been fully elucidated. We previously found that FC from non-obese diabetic mice (NOD) were compromised in enhancing engraftment of syngeneic and allogeneic HSC compared with FC from diabetes free congenic NOR mice. We therefore compared gene expression profiling between NOD FC and control NOR FC by microarray analysis. Among 18 most significant differentially expressed genes revealed from 45101 genes by false discovery rate control analysis with a cut-off value at level 0.05, dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) was identified as the gene with the most significant difference ( P = 1.07 Ã— 10 âˆ’7 ). DOCK2 is a hematopoietic cell-specific member of the Caenorhabditis elegans Ced-5, mammalian DOCK180 and Drosophila melanogaster myoblast city (CDM) family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. DOCK2 activates the small GTPase Rac and is indispensable for migration of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). FC is a heterogeneous cell population, with a predominant subpopulation resembling plasmacytoid precursor DC (p-preDC FC). In vitro studies demonstrated that FC increased clonogenicity of HSC and improved the ability of the impaired stroma to support late cobblestone area formation by HSC, which suggests that FC homing to hematopoietic niche as a potential component might be a perquisite for FC to enhance HSC engraftment. Therefore, we hypothesized that signaling pathways controlling cell migration via DOCK2 are critical for FC to enhance HSC engraftment. To test our hypothesis, DOCK2 expression data from microarray analysis was further confirmed using relative quantitative real-time PCR and high content image analysis. The expression level of DOCK2 in FC was significantly lower in NOD mice compared with NOR mice ( p vs. NOR FC). Functional phenotypes of DOCK2-deficient FC were determined by Transwell migration assay and colony-forming cell assay in vitro , and by co-transplantation of HSC with FC in vivo as well as enumeration of CellTrack Green labeled FC by flow cytometry in spleen, thymus, and bone marrow of femurs and tibias 18 hours post-transplantation. Deficiency of DOCK2 in FC did not affect the ability of FC in promoting HSC colony formation when the two were cultured together. However, DOCK2-deficient FC were compromised in migration to the Î±-cheemokine, stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) at dose 200 ng/ml (Fig. A, P vs. wild-type FC). Homing of FC to spleen and bone marrow of femurs and tibias was also significantly impaired in DOCK2-deficient FC. Moreover, deficiency of DOCK2 in FC abrogated enhancement of HSC engraftment by FC in the syngeneic and allogeneic in vivo assays (Fig. B, syngeneic model: 500 B6 HSC plus 30K B6 or DOCK2 âˆ’/âˆ’ FC into lethally irradiated B6 recipients; Fig. C, allogeneic model: 10K B6 HSC plus 30K B6 or DOCK2 âˆ’/âˆ’ FC into lethally irradiated B10.BR recipients, P vs. B6 HSC plus wild-type FC). Taken together, our results indicate that deficiency of DOCK2 in FC leads to the dysfunction in migration, and suggest that the signaling pathways involved in FC migration are crucial for FC to enhance HSC engraftment.

Respiratory infections occur despite high CD4 counts and low viral loads; therefore, better understanding of lung immunity and infection predictors is necessary. We tested whether metabolomics, an integrated biosystems approach to molecular fingerprinting, could differentiate such individual characteristics. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALfâ€‰) was collected from otherwise healthy HIV-1-infected individuals and healthy controls. A liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry method was used to detect metabolites in BALf. Statistical and bioinformatic analyses used false discovery rate (FDR) and orthogonally corrected partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to identify groupwise discriminatory factors as the top 5% of metabolites contributing to 95% separation of HIV-1 and control. We enrolled 24 subjects with HIV-1 (median CD4=432) and 24 controls. A total of 115 accurate mass m/z features from C18 and AE analysis were significantly different between HIV-1 subjects and controls (FDR=0.05). Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed clusters of metabolites, which discriminated the samples according to HIV-1 status (FDR=0.05). Several of these did not match any metabolites in metabolomics databases; mass-to-charge 325.065 ([M+H](+)) was significantly higher (FDR=0.05) in the BAL of HIV-1-infected subjects and matched pyochelin, a siderophore-produced Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Metabolic profiles in BALf differentiated healthy HIV-1-infected subjects and controls. The lack of association with known human metabolites and inclusion of a match to a bacterial metabolite suggest that the differences could reflect the host's lung microbiome and/or be related to subclinical infection in HIV-1-infected patients.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sushma K.

61a7de051713b534f416cd82c0a3c6358bb083a5,Genome-wide association studies of 74 plasma metabolites of German shepherd dogs reveal two metabolites associated with genes encoding their enzymes,"German shepherd dogs (GSDs) are a popular breed affected by numerous disorders. Few studies have explored genetic variations that influence canine blood metabolite levels. To investigate genetic variants affecting the natural metabolite variation in GSDs. A total of 82 healthy GSDs were genotyped on the Illumina CanineHD Beadchip, assaying 173,650 markers. For each dog, 74 metabolites were measured through liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (LCâ€“MS and GCâ€“MS) and were used as phenotypes for genome-wide association analyses (GWAS). Sliding window and homozygosity analyses were conducted to fine-map regions of interest, and to identify haplotypes and gene dosage effects. Summary statistics for 74 metabolites in this population of GSDs are reported. Forty-one metabolites had significant associations at a false discovery rate of 0.05. Two associations were located around genes which encode for enzymes for the relevant metabolites: 4-hydroxyproline was significantly associated to D-amino acid oxidase (DAO), and threonine to l-threonine 3-dehydrogenase (LOC477365). Three of the top ten haplotypes associated to 4-hydroxyproline included at least one SNP on DAO. These haplotypes occurred only in dogs with the highest 15 measurements of 4-hydroxyproline, ranging in frequency from 16.67 to 20%. None of the dogs were homozygous for these haplotypes. The top two haplotypes associated to threonine included SNPs on LOC477365 and were also overrepresented in dogs with the highest 15 measurements of threonine. These haplotypes occurred at a frequency of 90%, with 80% of these dogs homozygous for the haplotypes. In dogs with the lowest 15 measurements of threonine, the haplotypes occurred at a frequency of 26.67% and 0% homozygosity. DAO and LOC477365 were identified as candidate genes affecting the natural plasma concentration of 4-hydroxyproline and threonine, respectively. Further investigations are needed to validate the effects of the variants on these genes.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Pamela Xing Yi Soh"", ids = ""1388693721""); list(name = ""Juliana Maria Marin Cely"", ids = ""1396278610"");

574ed804a4b848acace93f46dc2f2aa67ce6f8d8,Regional Differential Genetic Response of Human Articular Cartilage to Impact Injury,"Objective Normal physiological movement creates different weightbearing zones within a human knee: the medial condyle bearing the highest and the trochlea bearing the lowest weight. Adaptation to different physiological loading conditions results in different tissue and cellular properties within a knee. The objective of this study was to use microarray analysis to examine gene expression differences among three anatomical regions of human knee articular cartilage at baseline and following induction of an acute impact injury. Design Cartilage explants were harvested from 7 cadaveric knees (12 plugs per knee). A drop tower was utilized to introduce injury. Plugs were examined 24 hours after impact for gene expression using microarray. The primary analysis is the comparison of baseline versus impacted samples within each region separately. In addition, pairwise comparisons among the three regions were performed at baseline and after impact. False discovery rate (FDR) was used to evaluate significance of differential gene expression. Results In the comparison of before and after injury, the trochlear had 130 differentially expressed genes (FDR â‰¤ 0.05) while the condyles had none. In the comparison among regions, smaller sets of differentially expressed genes (n â‰¤ 21) were found, with trochlea being more different than the condyles. Most of more frequently expressed genes in trochlea are developmental genes. Conclusions Within the experimental setup of this study, only the trochlea was displaying an acute genetic response on injury. Our data demonstrated the regional-specific response to injury in human articular cartilage.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lauren L. Vernon"", ids = ""34328693""); list(name = ""Danica D.

6d1342c5c72575bd743aeaa0af69ae32d5a46de2,Abstract 291: Genomewide scale epigenetic profile and prostate cancer recurrence,"Proceedings: AACR Annual Meeting 2014; April 5-9, 2014; San Diego, CA

Development and progression of prostate cancer reflect the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations. Although genetic changes are involved in the inactivation of genes with important anti-cancer functions, DNA methylation in a promoter region is an important epigenetic mechanism for the down-regulation (silencing) of expression of these genes. Therefore, we conducted a genome-wide profile of prostate tumors to identify epigenetically altered regions that distinguish recurrent from non-recurrent cases.

We profiled the epigenetic landscape of 125 prostate tumors using bisulfite treated tumor DNA samples extracted from 65 recurrent and 60 non-recurrent prostate cancer cases. Epigenome-wide methylation analysis was performed at the Molecular Genomic Core Facility of the Moffitt Cancer Center using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K Beadchip, which can quantitatively measure over 485,577 CpG sites with 99% coverage of RefSeq Gene and 96% coverage of CpG islands.

For methylation data analysis, intensities were normalized using Illumina GenomeStudio software. Beta values with assigned detection p-values > 0.01 were treated as missing data. We considered the methylation pattern at a larger region instead of methylation at single sites. Thus, in addition to evaluating methylation at single sites, we were interested in the number of significantly differently methylated probes within a gene as a measure of how significant a gene is. We identified 269 differentially methylated CpG sites between recurrent and non-recurrent tumor tissues, with a false discovery rate (FDR) q-value less than 0.05 and a mean methylation difference greater than 0.1 between the two groups (recurrent /non-recurrent cases).

Eleven genes where more than 25% of the measured positions were differently methylated (p 0.1 between the medians of the two groups) between recurrent and non-recurrent samples.

We further investigated ALEX1 (ARMCX1), which is one of the 11 genes and suggested as a tumor suppressor gene. ALEX1 (Arm protein lost in epithelial cancers, on chromosome X) is involved in a variety of processes such as cell adhesion, embryogenesis and tumorigenesis. Expression of ALEX1 mRNA is significantly reduced in various tumor tissues, including prostate carcinomas and in various cancer cell lines. We investigated expression level of ALEX1 in an additional 392 prostate tumor samples (145 recurrence and 247non-recurrent) using realtime RT-PCR. Based upon average Ct ratios between ALEX1 and Î² actin, ALEX1 is down regulated 2.67 fold in tumor tissues from recurrent cases as compared with non-recurrent cases (p<0.001). If replicated, these identified biomarkers may be used at the time of diagnosis to predict risk of recurrence and improve clinical treatment decision-making.

15e6047164dd7d9c602e08388daaccebe62ac5b2,Bioinformatic analysis of primary endothelial cell gene array data illustrated by the analysis of transcriptome changes in endothelial cells exposed to VEGF-A and PlGF,"We recently published a review in this journal describing the design, hybridisation and basic data processing required to use gene arrays to investigate vascular biology (Evans etal. Angiogenesis 2003; 6: 93--104). Here, we build on this review by describing a set of powerful and robust methods for the analysis and interpretation of gene array data derived from primary vascular cell cultures. First, we describe the evaluation of transcriptome heterogeneity between primary cultures derived from different individuals, and estimation of the false discovery rate introduced by this heterogeneity and by experimental noise. Then, we discuss the appropriate use of Bayesian t-tests, clustering and independent component analysis to mine the data. We illustrate these principles by analysis of a previously unpublished set of gene array data in which human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultured in either rich or low-serum media were exposed to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A165 or placental growth factor (PlGF)-1131. We have used Affymetrix U95A gene arrays to map the effects of these factors on the HUVEC transcriptome. These experiments followed a paired design and were biologically replicated three times. In addition, one experiment was repeated using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). In contrast to some previous studies, we found that VEGF-A and PlGF consistently regulated only small, non-overlapping and culture media-dependant sets of HUVEC transcripts, despite causing significant cell biological changes.",2004,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jonathan Schoenfeld"", ids = ""4253722""); list(name = ""Khashayar Lessan"", ids = ""4043336""); list(name = ""Nicola F.

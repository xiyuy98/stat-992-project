Although current American guidelines distinguish proton pump inhibitor-responsive oesophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE) from eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE), these entities are broadly similar. While two microarray studies showed that they have similar transcriptomes, more extensive RNA sequencing studies have not been done previously.


AIM
To determine whether RNA sequencing identifies genetic markers distinguishing PPI-REE from EoE.


METHODS
We retrospectively examined 13 PPI-REE and 14 EoE biopsies, matched for tissue eosinophil content, and 14 normal controls. Patients and controls were not PPI-treated at the time of biopsy. We did RNA sequencing on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, with differential expression confirmation by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We validated the use of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded vs RNAlater-preserved tissue, and compared our formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded EoE results to a prior EoE study.


RESULTS
By RNA sequencing, no genes were differentially expressed between the EoE and PPI-REE groups at the false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤0.01 level. Compared to normal controls, 1996 genes were differentially expressed in the PPI-REE group and 1306 genes in the EoE group. By less stringent criteria, only MAPK8IP2 was differentially expressed between PPI-REE and EoE (FDR = 0.029, 2.2-fold less in EoE than in PPI-REE), with similar results by PCR. KCNJ2, which was differentially expressed in a prior study, was similar in the EoE and PPI-REE groups by both RNA sequencing and real-time PCR.


CONCLUSION
Eosinophilic oesophagitis and PPI-REE have comparable transcriptomes, confirming that they are part of the same disease continuum.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kathryn Peterson"", ids = ""31540101""); list(name = ""Masaaki Yoshigi"", ids = ""2145389""); list(name = ""Mark W Hazel"", ids = ""48443333""); list(name = ""Don A Delker"", ids = ""5522137""); list(name = ""Ellen Lin"", ids = ""4141868""); list(name = ""Chaya Krishnamurthy"", ids = ""40442486""); list(name = ""N Consiglio"", ids = ""49164239""); list(name = ""J Robson"", ids = ""153350905""); list(name = ""Mark Yandell"", ids = ""1968099""); list(name = ""Frederic C.

In this study, we assessed the earliest cortical changes associated with AD in 71 cognitively healthy, adult children of AD patients (AD offspring) as compared with 69 with no family history of AD (non-AD offspring). Cortical thickness measures were obtained using FreeSurfer from 1.5T magnetic resonance (MR) scans. ApoE genotyping was obtained. Primary analyses examined family history and ApoeE4 effects on cortical thickness. Secondary analyses examined age effects within groups. All comparisons were adjusted using False Discovery Rate at a significance threshold of p<0.05. There were no statistically significant differences between family history and ApoE4 groups. Within AD offspring, increasing age was related to reduced cortical thickness (atrophy) over large areas of the precuneus, superior frontal and superior temporal gyri, starting at around age 60. Further, these patterns existed within female and maternal AD offspring, but were absent in male and paternal AD offspring. Within non-AD offspring, negative correlations existed over small regions of the superior temporal, insula and lingual cortices. These results suggest that as AD offspring age, cortical atrophy is more prominent, particularly if the parent with AD is mother or if the AD offspring is female.",2012,Psychology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Katherine Reiter"", ids = ""3055152""); list(name = ""Kathryn I.

0611aa744722d52b11840264f016a7f24f21dc70,The democratization of cryo-EM,"To the Editor: In their exchange of letters, van Helden1 and Halsey et al.2 debate the utility of the P value and of the confidence interval (CI) for interpreting experiments. In addition to the specific points raised, their exchange illustrates a clash of cultures that may be illuminating for readers to note. Namely, there are two broad mindsets: The craftsmanâ€”a single P value is reported as an end result of the analysis of a predefined single question, as is the case for, say, a clinical trial or a small-scale biological experiment. The industrialistâ€”P values are used to summarize a screen of many hypotheses, as in gene expression analysis, genome-wide association studies and other types of high-throughput biology. Typically, such analyses involve iterative data exploration, and the â€˜resultâ€™ is only an intermediate step, to be followed by more analysis. Importantly, the distribution of all the other P values gives a lot of contextual information for each particular P value. A clash can arise between the craftsmen (exemplified by the arguments of Halsey and colleagues) and the industrialists (exemplified by van Helden). For instance, the claim made by Halsey et al.2 that â€œthe problem with running the test many times is that this virtually never happens in practiceâ€ is true for the craftsman but blatantly wrong for large-scale testing. The figure presented by van Helden1 (including volcano plots and P value histograms) shows that he is thinking large. How does this affect the alleged fickleness of the P value? A single P value can be fickle. In particular, if the null hypothesis is true (i.e., there is no effect) or if the analysis is underpowered, the P value can lie anywhere between 0 and 1 with equal probability, and therefore it will be irreproducible. However, the distribution of many P values, industrially produced, is very reproducible, by virtue of the law of large numbers. In fact, in large-scale testing, P values are easier to deal with than CIs. Multiple testing is naturally and intuitively reasoned about in terms of P values, whereas this is roundabout with CIs. The contextual information of all P values can be modeled using Bayesian concepts, such as local false discovery rates and empirical nulls3. Moderated tests4 can avoid some of the fickleness, and these approaches have been hugely successful. Common to both sidesâ€™ arguments is the observation that the P value alone is an insufficient summary of an inferential process. To usefully report the results of a statistical analysis, scientists should provide not only P values but also the underlying data and the complete analysis workflow, using a reporting tool such as Jupyter or Rmarkdown.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""David I.

f4ad8c4866be95e8d99d0107f054ecc504e0bc1d,Identification and Validation of Genetic Variants that Influence Transcription Factor and Cell Signaling Protein Levels,"Many genetic variants associated with human disease have been found to be associated with alterations in mRNA expression. Although it is commonly assumed that mRNA expression changes will lead to consequent changes in protein levels, methodological challenges have limited our ability to test the degree to which this assumption holds true. Here, we further developed the micro-western array approach and globally examined relationships between human genetic variation and cellular protein levels. We collected more than 250,000 protein level measurements comprising 441 transcription factor and signaling protein isoforms across 68 Yoruba (YRI) HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and identified 12 cis and 160 trans protein level QTLs (pQTLs) at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 20%. Whereas up to two thirds of cis mRNA expression QTLs (eQTLs) were also pQTLs, many pQTLs were not associated with mRNA expression. Notably, we replicated and functionally validated a trans pQTL relationship between the KARS lysyl-tRNA synthetase locus and levels of the DIDO1 protein. This study demonstrates proof of concept in applying an antibody-based microarray approach to iteratively measure the levels of human proteins and relate these levels to human genome variation and other genomic data sets. Our results suggest that protein-based mechanisms might functionally buffer genetic alterations that influence mRNA expression levels and that pQTLs might contribute phenotypic diversity to a human population independently of influences on mRNA expression.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ronald J Hause"", ids = ""4217625""); list(name = ""Amy L.

08d815a7e198099734474afae98731febc168a25,Slug ( SNAI 2 ) Down-Regulation by RNA Interference Facilitates Apoptosis and Inhibits Invasive Growth in Neuroblastoma,"Purpose:We assessed the relevance of Slug (SNAI2) for apoptosis resistance and invasion potential of neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Experimental Design:We evaluated the effect of imatinib mesylate on invasion and analyzed the genes modulated by imatinib mesylate treatment in neuroblastoma cells. Slug expression, inhibited by imatinib mesylate treatment, was knocked down in neuroblastoma cells by RNA interference, and the effects on invasion and apoptosis were evaluated in vitro. A pseudometastatic model of neuroblastoma in severe combined immunodeficient mice was used to assess the effects of Slug silencing alone or in combination with imatinib mesylate treatment on metastasis development. Results: Microarray analysis revealed that several genes, including Slug, were down-regulated by imatinib mesylate. Slug expression was detectable in 8 of 10 human neuroblastoma cell lines. Two Slug-expressing cell lines were infected with a vector encoding a microRNA to Slug mRNA. Infected cells with reduced levels of Slug were tested for the expression of apoptosis-related genes (p53, Bax, and Bcl-2) identified previously as Slug targets. Bcl-2 was down-regulated in Slug-interfered cells. Slug down-regulation increased sensitivity to apoptosis inducedby imatinib mesylate, etoposide, or doxorubicin. Invasion of Slug-silenced cells was reduced in vitro. Animals injected with Slug-silenced cells had fewer tumors than controls and the inhibition of tumor growthwas even higher in animals treated with imatinib mesylate. Conclusions: Slug down-regulation facilitates apoptosis induced by proapoptotic drugs in neuroblastoma cells and decreases their invasion capability in vitro and in vivo. Slug inhibition, possibly combined with imatinib mesylate, may represent a novel strategy for treatment of metastatic neuroblastoma. Formation of secondary tumors (metastasis) in organs distant from the primary neoplasm is the leading cause of death in cancer patients (1). Along the metastatic route, tumor cells invade the tissues surrounding the primary tumor, enter either the lymphatics or the bloodstream, survive and eventually arrest in the circulation, extravasate into a tissue, and grow at the distant site (2). To fulfill these tasks, cancer cells must undergo profound and interconnected changes that modify their morphology and function. At molecular level, these changes are driven by the modulation of several genes whose identity is not yet completely known. Schematically, the picture emerging from recent data suggests that tumor cells transit to mesenchymal phenotype (3, 4), up-regulate specialized proteases (5), and expose membrane receptors that allow them to home to permissive locations (6). In addition, metastatic cells also need to activate angiogenesis at distant sites (7) by releasing angiogenic factors. A growing body of evidence has pointed out to the relevance of several distinct families of transcription factors able to mediate the changes required for local invasion, the initial and critical step to metastasis (4). Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial childhood tumor with a prevalence of 1 case in 7,000 live births (8). Neuroblastoma derives from cells of the sympatoadrenal lineage of the neural crest that arrest at some stage of their differentiation (8). Approximately 40% of newly diagnosed patients present with localized disease that, in most cases, is easily curable or regresses spontaneously (9). By contrast, f50% of patients present with metastatic disease associated Cancer Therapy: Preclinical Authorsâ€™Affiliations: Section of Toxicology and Biomedical Sciences, ENEA Research Center Casaccia; Department of Experimental Oncology, Regina Elena Cancer Institute; Department of Pediatrics, La Sapienza University; Laboratory of Oncology, Bambino Gesu' Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Rome, Italy; Department of Biological Technologies,Wyeth Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Division of Child Health, School of Reproductive and Developmental Medicine, Liverpool University, Liverpool, United Kingdom Received12/19/07; revised 2/22/08; accepted 3/5/08.

Â© 2008 American Association for Cancer clincancerres.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from with very poor outcome despite intensive therapeutic protocols including high-dose chemotherapy and myeloablative regimens followed by hematopoietic rescue (10). A peculiar type of neuroblastoma, so called stage 4S, characterized by a small primary tumor and a widespread involvement of liver, skin, or bone marrow that almost always spontaneously regress (11), accounts forf5% to 7% of the cases. The clinical heterogeneity of neuroblastoma is mirrored by the complexity of the genetic features that characterize this tumor (8). Apart from MYCN genomic amplification, the alteration more consistently associated with poor outcome (12), several other genetic changes are currently used to better define prognosis (9). The neuroectodermal origin of neuroblastoma suggests that this tumor can spread from the primary site using mechanisms similar to those operating during the formation and delamination of the embryonic neural crest (13). Thus, the same gene(s) that are relevant for the migration of neural crest cells may also play a role in the acquisition of the invasive phenotype of neuroblastoma cells. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Glivec, STI-571) is a soluble small-molecule successfully used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia for its inhibitory activity of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase (14). Subsequently, the use of imatinib mesylate has been extended to gastrointestinal stromal tumors where it acts by inhibiting c-Kit (15). We and others showed that imatinib mesylate is also active in inhibiting neuroblastoma growth in vitro and in vivo (16â€“18). Of interest, other studies confirming the antiproliferative activity of imatinib mesylate in neuroblastoma have suggested that the drugâ€™s activity is not strictly dependent on c-Kit inhibition (19, 20). It should be also noted that a recent clinical trial on refractory or relapsed childhood solid tumors, including neuroblastoma, described imatinib mesylate as a single agent at a dose of 440 mg/m/d shows little or no activity (21). In this study, we evaluated the effect of imatinib mesylate in reducing invasion and metastasis in neuroblastoma cells. By applying microarray analysis, we identified the transcription factor Slug (SNAI2; ref. 4) as a target of imatinib mesylate. By inhibiting Slug expression by RNA interference, we found that reduced Slug levels decreased survival and invasion in neuroblastoma. Finally, in a pseudometastatic model of neuroblastoma in mice, we showed an additive effect of Slug silencing and imatinib mesylate treatment in reducing the metastatic burden. These data suggest that Slug is a relevant gene for regulation of the metastatic potential of neuroblastoma cells and that strategies combining imatinib mesylate treatment and Slug inhibition may be suitable as a treatment of metastatic neuroblastoma. Materials andMethods Cell lines. Human neuroblastoma cell lines SK-N-BE2c, SK-N-BE, SK-N-AS, SH-EP, KCNR, ACN, RN-GA, GI-CA-N, LAN-5, and HTLA-230 were kept in culture as described previously (16). Reagents. Imatinib mesylate was provided by Novartis Pharma, etoposide by Bristol-Myers Squibb, and doxorubicin by Pharmacia. Microarray analysis. Total RNA was extracted from cells seeded on Matrigel-coated dishes (BD Biosciences) using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized starting with 5 Ag total RNA using the SuperScript System (Invitrogen). The cDNA was purified by filtration through Multiscreen filter plate (Millipore) and transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (Epicenter) and biotinylated nucleotides (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences). Hybridization buffer containing the spike pool reagent was added to each of the fragmented cRNA mixtures and each sample was hybridized to the Human Genome U133 2.0 array (Affymetrix) at 45jC for 18 h as recommended by the manufacturer. The hybridized chips were washed and stained using Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 and the EukGE-WS2v4_450 protocol as recommended by the manufacturer. The staining was done using streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate (Molecular Probes) followed by biotinylated antibody against streptavidin (Vector Laboratories) and then streptavidinphycoerythrin. The chips were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner and .cel files were generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software. Using normalized data, after removing lowly expressed genes (those with a signal value below 43) and those that were consistently called absent â€˜â€˜A,â€™â€™ we imposed a nonstringent 1.1-fold change between imatinib mesylateâ€“ treated and untreated samples. A t test was done, and qualifiers with a P V 0.05 were then subjected to false discovery testing to select qualifiers with a false discovery rate V 25%.

5c6b8d14e2b2e41d614cce92ae43d1a3f94ccdbb,A Hierarchical Semi-Markov Model for Detecting Enrichment with Application to ChIP-Seq Experiments,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by direct sequencing (ChIP-Seq) has revolutionalized the experiments in profiling DNA-protein interactions and chromatin remodeling patterns. However, limited statistical tools are available for modeling and analyzing the ChIP-Seq data thoroughly. We carefully study the data generating mechanism of ChIP-Seq data and propose a new model-based approach for detecting enriched regions. Our model is based on a hierarchical mixture model which gives rise to a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB), coupled with a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) to address the sequencing depth and biases, the inherent spatial data structure and allows for detection of multiple non-overlapping variable size peaks. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed ZINB accounts for the excess zeroes and over-dispersion in the observed data relative to a Poisson distribution, and this model provides a better fit as the background distribution. We also propose a new meta false discovery rate (FDR) control at peak level as an alternative to the usual heuristic postprocessing of enriched bins identified via bin level FDR control. We show with simulations and case studies that this new procedure allows for the boundaries of peak regions to be declared probabilistically and provides accurate FDR control.",2009,,"list(name = ""Pei Fen Kuan"", ids = ""34864653""); list(name = ""Guangjin Pan"", ids = ""35253934""); list(name = ""Ron Stewart"", ids = ""143723192""); list(name = ""SÃ¼ndÃ¼z KeleÅŸ"", ids = ""152766143"")",d4f5c0ac2a320c2b3b5022e011be24c210c040ff; 25badc676197a70aaf9911865eb03469e402ba57,cb22bfd8f6064ed946e0ed266ad1cdbb67699f65; 4f875276fc9a2fc6ceac645664c3263e4bfdfae1; bf84db7197b5336225efd88a34bfd590603e7ee0; 9c6bf5157ad2fb538089de9fc9c3c453025d4d17; 27ce0d396b040e14b29de98ea0d602ef5e392379; 339635681c59c0acf2c529070058bfcbab940b1e; 36df7ee40ae7658b8a010b9219308c2dc1eaa199; 8fe2ea0a67954f1380b3387e3262f1cdb9f9b3e5; 72291d5f2ff38bfc0ab007867b702deb181a85e4; a24b890fb3863998a8376630375e5325e669b291; 58e4b0234120f8d6902ee9b457736eaca76f6dca; bb82a405ebad7fa19f4ead4c0aa36ed71b5df39b; e5b2f46a23310a7a5968471e59d85a01e7adab69; c1a38f4b9b4ad8d44a3bafe8849eabe1c6683377; 7556b9ed82077eae8724966dfd6b102354551f2b; 4f332a98b143b9988de03690fae1f71f6b57eff3; d8fb729b9f1c06f56095ecfef9dd1dfeddadb7dc; 0ee5beb5f614e508c86360c35013ab15611c5e52; e588cdc331bce50851cccd843e57d70afb2e2aec; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; bb478fc83df4331b8603de59a50085946cf941c1; 2a1932e1e1ceae34ab015cf7d411c5a112616bb8; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35,,,

In the litterature, it exists two popular methods: The Penalized Least Square (PLS) and the Filtered Derivative introduced by Basseville end Nikirov.We give a new method of filtered derivative and false discovery rate (FDqV) on real data (the wind turbines and heartbeats series).

In our study we estimate the distribution of the false discovery proportion (FDP) for the same procedure under a variety of correlation structures among multiple dependent variables in a MANOVA context. Specifically, we study the mean (the FDR), skewness, kurtosis, and percentiles of the FDP distribution in the case of multiple comparisons that give rise to correlated non-central t-statistics when results at several time periods are being compared to baseline. Even if the FDR achieves its nominal value, other aspects of the distribution of the FDP depend on the interaction between signed effect sizes and correlations among variables, proportion of true nulls, and number of dependent variables. We show examples where the mean FDP (the FDR) is 10% as designed, yet there is a surprising probability of having 30% or more false discoveries. Thus, in a real experiment, the proportion of false discoveries could be quite different from the stipulated FDR.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Alan H.

As a test consists of multiple items, such multiple testing may increase the possibility of making a Type I error at least once. The goal of this study was to investigate how to control a Type I error rate and power using adjustment procedures for multiple testing, which have been widely used in applied statistics. In the simulation, four distinct DIF methods were performed under various testing conditions. The methods were the Mantelâ€“Haenszel (MH) method, the logistic regression (LR) procedure, the Differential Functioning Item and Test (DFIT) framework, and Lordâ€™s chi-square test. As an adjustment procedure, the Bonferroni correction, Holmâ€™s procedure, or the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) false discovery rate was applied. The results showed the MH and the LR clearly benefited from Holmâ€™s and the BH adjustments, whereas the DFIT and Lordâ€™s chi-square test did not require adjustments for conditions und...",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ji Hye Kim"", ids = ""49477078""); list(name = ""Tsunehiko Oshima"", ids = ""1937736"")",502f600a998153cb5b76e0cee54bafd88c4e7260; ef625fc99e9dde6223db3d851d70363d186aff20; c6044ea1e9658996555a528459b9454ea5eef5f6; 8d800b354aa4a670793172c0e4a943c1423b5801; 9399991d0e89c39d94f36852cd932f8aa1b40e26; 3c1e1739cda7bf666a313d7403e02fef401e3e0b; 44594ca40ef1c881c454b0d3e3fc205b50c113bd; 6d33d46d9c22eb4c088495f9eccb7dc298b8157b; 2ea0ce4e74d974e8ddb33918cc71cff5807e89f9; a5f918e225323722e204e278da1c0968a4ac0c3d; c3ca8cbbbd1fd798c14faa1d35765e5ad66b6a8e; ea6a4c396be1046969c5ce093b4ff483fc60ecab; 0a9d2e485e482ecf898fe33c7d082f05d73da37f,cd7c99d031c3391e64e5cfc412b98b6033137c41; ae0c9faee776c76c8465df3462823f893704a78e; d14b3b6e927ff8e51406fad1010244ecabc07da0; d0476004085419b8a44953f5cdab11442c12ffaa; 539731a62bfe5eb1e35bd0397d4be514833eeca1; 4bdb4e643a4a80a96032864c5995369f6e4261d6; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 8ab7bf467568ca91409899c177ca098c08658ee7; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; 0b52707ae78d3babcee02520202fbda3e3ae3517; 82b377f1c050857efc71703411a6a7d7ac87aaeb; 545c20c1f2575833f81418f4757cb78446465cd7; 5fbc064e7104036b77a2bf6f0ad509031965c275; 7677f4246af710d77b6c0e041d6181582b76f2c2; ae805b87cff9e92472f537fe1b26506c2426fbcc; d1a3e214ddc84d11c5b250dfca49703270141d3d; f19d7826a3913d25c45f4ef663f54ab75d16674e; e1aaada8d79746cff8ab8010e4053ae069855297; 400db851cebc917c98846b6e506115821145db65; 2e6b125046a9efcd914aeef32caeb881f1105bcb; f5a04bbf171d96bf7b558a56e3c14ef107a5ae55; 6c564a11aa26bb4cae5aeb40d3612eebad237f5f; 4bf367f488a8b1a82b6a67b5bad51f9711f4cf78; e72d2a0abd16906c584ff1f371af5afaf26277ae; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; ab95089501aed8bf661f1949e786a301cbb7e1bf; 1160ff2e2e0bd7a51f448bb695fd328cfe39ea0f; 30e7dd4ca2156612f67641fab214cf8a5e0bd482,Educational and Psychological Measurement,73,458-470

We aimed to investigate the potentially altered gene and pathway expression in advanced peripheral atherosclerotic plaques in comparison to healthy control arteries. Gene expression analysis was performed (Illumina HumanHT-12 version 3 Expression BeadChip) for 68 advanced atherosclerotic plaques (15 aortic, 29 carotid and 24 femoral plaques) and 28 controls (left internal thoracic artery (LITA)) from Tampere Vascular Study. Dysregulation of individual genes was compared to healthy controls and between plaques from different arterial beds and Ingenuity pathway analysis was conducted on genes with a fold change (FC)â€‰>â€‰Â±1.5 and false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05. 787 genes were significantly differentially expressed in atherosclerotic plaques. The most up-regulated genes were osteopontin and multiple MMPs, and the most down-regulated were cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector C and A (CIDEC, CIDEA) and apolipoprotein D (FCâ€‰>â€‰20). 156 pathways were differentially expressed in atherosclerotic plaques, mostly inflammation-related, especially related with leukocyte trafficking and signaling. In artery specific plaque analysis 50.4% of canonical pathways and 41.2% GO terms differentially expressed were in common for all three arterial beds.

One of the goals of the present study was to determine any similarities or disparities across industry type in regards to HFACS causal categories. Seven data sources represented five different industry types were collected and analyzed for percentage of cases associated with a causal factor at each HFACS causal category. Skill-based errors were found to dominate the unsafe acts tier regardless of industry type. Different statistical methods for determining population differences yielded conflicting results. Significant differences were found among certain data source pairings when the traditional two-proportion z-test was applied; however, the differences were found to be non-significant when the false discovery rate method was applied.

9bf0123dca62945783a55a99d712e93357a38539,"Controlling false discoveries in multidimensional directional decisions, with applications to gene expression data on ordered categories.","Microarray gene expression studies over ordered categories are routinely conducted to gain insights into biological functions of genes and the underlying biological processes. Some common experiments are time-course/dose-response experiments where a tissue or cell line is exposed to different doses and/or durations of time to a chemical. A goal of such studies is to identify gene expression patterns/profiles over the ordered categories. This problem can be formulated as a multiple testing problem where for each gene the null hypothesis of no difference between the successive mean gene expressions is tested and further directional decisions are made if it is rejected. Much of the existing multiple testing procedures are devised for controlling the usual false discovery rate (FDR) rather than the mixed directional FDR (mdFDR), the expected proportion of Type I and directional errors among all rejections. Benjamini and Yekutieli (2005, Journal of the American Statistical Association 100, 71-93) proved that an augmentation of the usual Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure can control the mdFDR while testing simple null hypotheses against two-sided alternatives in terms of one-dimensional parameters. In this article, we consider the problem of controlling the mdFDR involving multidimensional parameters. To deal with this problem, we develop a procedure extending that of Benjamini and Yekutieli based on the Bonferroni test for each gene. A proof is given for its mdFDR control when the underlying test statistics are independent across the genes. The results of a simulation study evaluating its performance under independence as well as under dependence of the underlying test statistics across the genes relative to other relevant procedures are reported. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to a time-course microarray data obtained by Lobenhofer et al. (2002, Molecular Endocrinology 16, 1215-1229). We identified several important cell-cycle genes, such as DNA replication/repair gene MCM4 and replication factor subunit C2, which were not identified by the previous analyses of the same data by Lobenhofer et al. (2002) and Peddada et al. (2003, Bioinformatics 19, 834-841).

835b10b66d6cf5f5944f4bd3e11bcb76751d2ca2,Hippocampal Subfield Volumes in Patients With First-Episode Psychosis,"Background
Hippocampal abnormalities have been largely reported in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and are considered to be involved in the pathophysiology of the psychosis. The hippocampus consists of several subfields but it remains unclear their involvement in the early stages of psychosis.


Aim
The aim of this study was to investigate volumetric alterations in hippocampal subfields in patients at the first-episode psychosis (FEP).


Methods
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected in 134 subjects (58 FEP patients; 76 healthy controls [HC]). A novel automated hippocampal segmentation algorithm was used to segment the hippocampal subfields, based on an atlas constructed from ultra-high resolution imaging on ex vivo hippocampal tissue. The general linear model was used to investigate volume differences between FEP patients and HC, with age, gender and total intracranial volume as covariates.


Results
We found significantly lower volumes of bilateral CA1, CA4, and granule cell layer (GCL), and of left CA3, and left molecular layer (ML) in FEP patients compared to HC. Only the volumes of the left hippocampus and its subfields were significantly lower in FEP than HC at the False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 0.1. No correlation was found between hippocampal subfield volume and duration of illness, age of onset, duration of medication, and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).


Conclusion
We report abnormally low volumes of left hippocampal subfields in patients with FEP, sustaining its role as a putative neural marker of psychosis onset.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Valentina Baglivo"", ids = ""5173710""); list(name = ""Bo Cao"", ids = ""46926532""); list(name = ""Benson Mwangi"", ids = ""145321317""); list(name = ""Marcella Bellani"", ids = ""2069094""); list(name = ""Cinzia Perlini"", ids = ""48065247""); list(name = ""Antonio Lasalvia"", ids = ""2850778""); list(name = ""Nicola Dusi"", ids = ""2081504""); list(name = ""Chiara Bonetto"", ids = ""2228398""); list(name = ""Doriana Cristofalo"", ids = ""3697325""); list(name = ""Franco Alessandrini"", ids = ""36939432""); list(name = ""Giada Zoccatelli"", ids = ""34334315""); list(name = ""Elisa Francesca Maria Ciceri"", ids = ""3231382""); list(name = ""Lamonaca Dario"", ids = ""46191682""); list(name = ""Ceccato Enrico"", ids = ""46229386""); list(name = ""Pileggi Francesca"", ids = ""46179788""); list(name = ""Fausto Mazzi"", ids = ""5178022""); list(name = ""Santonastaso Paolo"", ids = ""46249925""); list(name = ""Matteo Balestrieri"", ids = ""2393951""); list(name = ""Jair C.

e94a122caba6618c7177e7ae6de8d2e5ab868dbe,PD03-02: Prognostic and Predictive Predictors for Triple Negative Breast Cancer.,"Background: Both the prognosis and the therapeutic options in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) are rather limited. Current prognostic gene expression profiles for breast cancer mainly reflect proliferation status and are most useful in ER-positive cancers. The identification of prognostic gene signatures from TNBC cohorts in previous studies was hindered due to relatively small sample sizes. Materials and Methods: All currently available TNBC gene expression datasets generated on Affymetrix U133 gene chips were assembled. To minimize inter-laboratory variation we analyzed only highly comparable arrays and data set-biased genes were filtered. Supervised analysis was applied to identify a prognostic signature from a finding cohort of 394 TNBC and validation was performed in an independent cohort of 261 TNBC. The genes from the prognostic predictor were analyzed for their correlation to known molecular phenotypes among TNBC. Results: Two supervised prognostic signatures consisting of 264 and 26 probesets, respectively, were obtained when applying different cutoffs for false discovery rates of 25% and Citation Information: Cancer Res 2011;71(24 Suppl):Abstract nr PD03-02.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Thomas Karn"", ids = ""2354221""); list(name = ""Lajos Pusztai"", ids = ""2467239""); list(name = ""Eugen Ruckhaeberle"", ids = ""4249313""); list(name = ""Cornelia Liedtke"", ids = ""79569348""); list(name = ""Manfred Schmidt"", ids = ""143611546""); list(name = ""Volkmar Mueller"", ids = ""83170559""); list(name = ""Regine Gaetje"", ids = ""6558834""); list(name = ""Lars Christian Hanker"", ids = ""5462356""); list(name = ""AndrÃ© Ahr"", ids = ""6722481""); list(name = ""Uwe Holtrich"", ids = ""4440653""); list(name = ""Achim Rody"", ids = ""49057745""); list(name = ""Manfred Kaufmann"", ids = ""49843004"")",,,Cancer Research,71,
4b53127fc6c5ed861594395b5e77d36951c2bc05,Identification of novel genetic loci for osteoporosis and/or rheumatoid arthritis using cFDR approach,"There are co-morbidity between osteoporosis (OP) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Some genetic risk factors have been identified for these two phenotypes respectively in previous research; however, they accounted for only a small portion of the underlying total genetic variances. Here, we sought to identify additional common genetic loci associated with OP and/or RA. The conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) approach allows detection of additional genetic factors (those respective ones as well as common pleiotropic ones) for the two associated phenotypes. We collected and analyzed summary statistics provided by large, multi-center GWAS studies of FNK (femoral neck) BMD (a major risk factor for osteoporosis) (n = 53,236) and RA (n = 80,799). The conditional quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots can assess the enrichment of SNPs related to FNK BMD and RA, respectively. Furthermore, we identified shared loci between FNK BMD and RA using conjunction cFDR (ccFDR). We found strong enrichment of p-values in FNK BMD when conditional Q-Q was done on RA and vice versa.

Whether hyperglycemic states result in a disruption of similar molecular mechanisms in endothelial cells under both diabetic and non-diabetic states, remains largely unknown. This study aimed to address this gap in knowledge through molecular and functional characterization of primary rat cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (RCMVECs) derived from the T2DM Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat model in comparison to control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) in response to a normal (NG) and hyperglycemic (HG) microenvironment. GK and WKY RCMVECs were cultured under NG (4.5 mM) and HG (25 mM) conditions for 3 weeks, followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), qPCR, tube formation assay, microplate based fluorimetry, and mitochondrial respiration analyses. Following database matching and filtering (false discovery rate â‰¤ 5%, scan count â‰¥ 10), we identified a greater percentage of significantly altered proteins in GK (7.1%, HG versus NG), when compared to WKY (3.5%, HG versus NG) RCMVECs. Further stringent filters (log2ratio of > 2 or < -2, p < 0.05) followed by enrichment and pathway analyses of the MS/MS and quantitative PCR datasets (84 total genes screened), resulted in the identification of several molecular targets involved in angiogenic, redox and metabolic functions that were distinctively altered in GK as compared to WKY RCMVECs following HG exposure. While the expression of thirteen inflammatory and apoptotic genes were significantly increased in GK RCMVECs under HG conditions (p < 0.05), only 2 were significantly elevated in WKY RCMVECs under HG conditions. Several glycolytic enzymes were markedly reduced and pyruvate kinase activity was elevated in GK HG RCMVECs, while in mitochondrial respiratory chain activity was altered. Supporting this, TNFÎ± and phorbol ester (PMA)-induced Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production were significantly enhanced in GK HG RCMVECs when compared to baseline levels (p < 0.05). Additionally, PMA mediated increase was the greatest in GK HG RCMVECs (p < 0.05). While HG caused reduction in tube formation assay parameters for WKY RCMVECs, GK RCMVECs exhibited impaired phenotypes under baseline conditions regardless of the glycemic microenvironment. We conclude that hyperglycemic microenvironment caused distinctive changes in the bioenergetics and REDOX pathways in the diabetic endothelium as compared to those observed in a healthy endothelium.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Dhanush Haspula"", ids = ""8440045""); list(name = ""Andrew K.

3bffa5910f94f6606908a46d8229b8cefc128896,Abstract 172: Circulating Mirna Profiles Discriminate Stroke Severity Associated With Age and Sex,"Background: Age and sex have significant effects on stroke outcomes, however, the precise mechanisms by which these factors affect stroke pathophysiology remains unclear. Small non-coding RNA (miRNA) found in circulation have been used successfully as biomarkers and mechanistic targets for chronic and acute diseases. The present study investigated the impact of age and sex on microRNA expression following ischemic stroke.

Methods: Adult (6 mo) and middle aged (11-12 mo) female and male rats were subject to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) using Endothelin-1. Blood samples were drawn at 2d and 5d post stroke. All animals were terminated at 5d and the brains processed for infarct analysis by standard histological procedures. Total RNA isolated from serum was subject to QPCR amplification for serum microRNAs (168) and 7 reference microRNAs (Exiqon focus panels). Normalized miRNA values were analyzed by Genesifter program using a two-way ANOVA with Benjamini and Hochberg corrections for false discovery rates..

Results: Normalized infarct volume was significantly smaller in adult females (0.12+) as compared to middle-aged females (0.4; p<0.05), young males (0.51 ) or middle aged males (0.51. p<0.05). At 2d post stroke, 30 circulating miRNAs were differentially regulated and principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed that most of the variance was due to age. At 5d post stroke, 79 circulating miRNAs exhibited significantly different regulation, and PCA indicated that most of the variance was associated with sex. A small cohort (5) of miRNAs, miR-15a, -19b, -32, -136 and -199a-3p were found to be highly expressed in adult females compared to middle aged females, adult and middle-aged males. Predicted and experimentally validated gene targets for these 5 miRNAs analyzed for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways revealed that the top 10 KEGG pathways (high p values, large gene numbers) were related to growth factor signaling, cell structure and MAPK signaling.

Conclusion: Overall, the pattern of circulating miRNA expression suggests an early influence of age in stroke pathology, with a later emergence of sex as a factor for stroke severity. Furthermore, a small cohort of miRNAs were found to discriminate severe and mild stroke infarction.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Amutha Selvamani"", ids = ""6401519""); list(name = ""Madison H Wright-Williams"", ids = ""1421924612""); list(name = ""Rajesh C Miranda"", ids = ""4185764""); list(name = ""Farida Sohrabji"", ids = ""6502804"")",0c1407f730520e840ba7f9f07652de28ceaeac6d,,Stroke,45,
778f7196fd68748957cfc8bfccc1445fb4b3b3ef,Analysis of gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to a 50-Hz magnetic field,"Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to 100-Î¼T, 50-Hz sinusoidal intermittent (5 min off, 10 min on) magnetic fields for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from exposed and sham-exposed cells and was then analyzed via a DNA microarray technique. Interestingly, the expression of a subunit of the L-type Ca channel was 2.3-fold higher in exposed cells; this finding may be relevant to similar previously published results (an increase of Î±1C and Î±1D subunits of L-type Ca channel in neuronal stem cells as preveiously demonstrated by Piacentini and colleagues in 2008. However, analysis of the false discovery rate precluded us from drawing firm conclusions about the effects of magnetic fields on gene expression in HUVECs. Nevertheless, non-coding RNAs were more common than coding RNAs among the genes that were differentially expressed with a > 2-fold or < 0.5-fold difference between exposed and sham-exposed cells. A similar result was obtained when the expression data from exposed cells or those from sham-exposed cells were analyzed separately. Thus, the higher frequency of non-coding RNAs than that of coding RNAs among the differentially expressed genes was attributed to the higher degree of fluctuation in the expression of non-coding RNA. Interestingly, this fluctuation seems to be a characteristic intrinsic to non-coding RNAs themselves.",2015,Chemistry,"list(name = ""Hidetake Miyata"", ids = ""13076800""); list(name = ""Masami Ishido"", ids = ""5098525""); list(name = ""Maresuke Nakayama"", ids = ""15265620""); list(name = ""Kenichi Ishizawa"", ids = ""5755410""); list(name = ""Masatoshi Murase"", ids = ""8115288""); list(name = ""Tsuyoshi Hondou"", ids = ""5622765"")",,26c4eed7ce150f137e7b452e22fff3cfcc580e43; eea88b91558e5e5addb3345ff3f3282d8b862dc7; d129e6421047334e101f25319212f7129a30f00b; 7a15d72ae5f9ffb6aae3c670365484b9de922011; 14e68b115e03cc61f0076c9b957ac3e4b252b025; c3e21ad371c5bbb273ad99f1f58d6a5095851f77; 0429a0e06278f0c72991daef88db21304031a457; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 206b48d0a398490519a80e465bc6c0d8fe1339b9; 17c894e28abdbb2a10f839f2957f76e3f9228a8b; 4c3bb32ee9fc97c3e4f00009dc0d950f7de1053b; 116fed4779c786c01b875cea7941a02380e63651; dbff406b6c3c12a0dcb5ad8e66da64b2bd2a14a3; 48ca0c84584e41121fc83087f2efa0b051b523a7; 4c44c970ad2d37a2960327df14e17a43b8836c6e; 092832c2443dbe966744a26b783f6e7b2d0c5473; d0a5dba019bcf4dea0337fd7df08df1616bb9793; 1478c1ceca42559e252210b830f9603e292f34a2,,2015,1-11
4afeecc6cfc6e22fbdd95a1043a0798bbe8fcac7,Human pain genetics database: a resource dedicated to human pain genetics research,"Abstract The Human Pain Genetics Database (HPGDB) is a comprehensive variant-focused inventory of genetic contributors to human pain. After curation, the HPGDB currently includes 294 studies reporting associations between 434 distinct genetic variants and various pain phenotypes. Variants were then submitted to a comprehensive analysis. First, they were validated in an independent high-powered replication cohort by testing the association of each variant with 10 different pain phenotypes (n = 1320-26,973). One hundred fifty-five variants replicated successfully (false discovery rate 20%) in at least one pain phenotype, and the association P values of the HPGDB variants were significantly lower compared with those of random controls. Among the 155 replicated variants, 21 had been included in the HPGDB because of their association with analgesia-related and 13 with nociception-related phenotypes, confirming analgesia and nociception as pathways of vulnerability for pain phenotypes. Furthermore, many genetic variants were associated with multiple pain phenotypes, and the strength of their association correlated between many pairs of phenotypes. These genetic variants explained a considerable amount of the variance between different pairs of pain phenotypes, indicating a shared genetic basis among pain phenotypes. In addition, we found that HPGDB variants show many pleiotropic associations, indicating that genetic pathophysiological mechanisms are also shared among painful and nonpainful conditions. Finally, we demonstrated that the HPGDB data set is significantly enriched for functional variants that modify gene expression, are deleterious, and colocalize with open chromatin regions.

0bdd90a8e2e76134f5f9517e84a2aadaeba9559c,MicroRNA Expression Profile Changes after Cardiopulmonary Bypass and Ischemia/Reperfusion-Injury in a Porcine Model of Cardioplegic Arrest.,"Identification of microRNAs (miRNA) associated with cardiopulmonary bypass, cardiac arrest and subsequent myocardial ischemia/reperfusion may unravel novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass and temperature of cardioplegic arrest on myocardial miRNA profile in pigs' left ventricular tissue. We employed next-generation sequencing to analyse miRNA profiles in the following groups: (1) hearts were arrested with antegrade warm St Thomas Hospital No. 2 (STH2) cardioplegia (n = 5; STH2-warm, 37 Â°C) and (2) cold STH2 (n = 6; STH2-cold, 4 Â°C) cardioplegia. Sixty min of ischemia was followed by 60 min of on-pump reperfusion with an additional 90 min of off-pump reperfusion. In addition, two groups without cardiac arrest (off-pump and on-pump group; n = 3, respectively) served as additional controls. STH2-warm and STH2-cold cardioplegia revealed no hemodynamic differences. In contrast, coronary venous creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) levels were significantly lower in pigs receiving STH2-warm cardioplegia (p < 0.05). Principal component analysis revealed that cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest markedly affected miRNAs in left ventricular tissue. Accordingly, ssc-miR-122, ssc-miR-10a-5p, ssc-miR-193a-3p, ssc-miR-499-3p, ssc-miR-374a-5p, ssc-miR-345-5p, ssc-miR-142-3p, ssc-miR-424-5p, ssc-miR-545-3p, ssc-miR-30b-5p, ssc-miR-145-5p, ssc-miR-374b-5p and ssc-miR-139-3p were differently regulated by cardiopulmonary bypass (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 versus off-pump group). However, only ssc-miR-451 was differently expressed between STH2-warm and STH2-cold (FDR < 0.05). These data demonstrate for the first time that cardiopulmonary bypass and temperature of cardioplegic solution affected the expression of miRNAs in left ventricular tissue. In conclusion, specific miRNAs are potential therapeutic targets for limiting ischemia-reperfusion injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Attila Kiss"", ids = ""77408861""); list(name = ""Stefan Heber"", ids = ""48169139""); list(name = ""Anne-Margarethe Kramer"", ids = ""32752778""); list(name = ""Matthias Hackl"", ids = ""50477107""); list(name = ""Susanna Skalicky"", ids = ""38138068""); list(name = ""Seth Hallstroem"", ids = ""49316798""); list(name = ""Bruno K.

4376117078f03df9168d7caf1ec61f812770dbae,Identification of Survival Critical Genomic Gains or Losses in Myeloma (MM) Using Array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH).,"Genetic abnormalities are important in the pathobiology of myeloma and established prognostic factors. High-density aCGH allow global unbiased detection of genomic gains and losses. In this study, we attempt to identify survival critical genomic aberrations by correlating aCGH-defined abnormalities with survival in 2 different cohorts of patients. aCGH was performed in 64 MM patients treated with high dose therapy from the Mayo Clinic using Agilentâ€™s 44k DNA microarray genechip. In addition, a publicly available aCGH dataset performed in 67 MM patients treated with total therapy from the University of Arkansas Medical School using the lower density Agilent 22k chip (Human 1A v2) was also analyzed. Base 2 logarithms of the ratios between red and green intensities (log-ratios) were treated as a primary measure of copy number ratio between tumor and normal samples. To detect the regions of genomic aberration, values of a sliding window of 15 consecutive log-ratios were compared with those of an artificial â€˜referenceâ€™ chromosome using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The reference chromosome, constructed for each sample, was assembled by collecting log-ratio values close to zero. For this, 15 randomly sampled log-ratios from autosomal regions whose p-value of Wilcoxon signed rank test against 0 was larger than 0.05 were recursively accepted until the number of log-ratios in the assembled reference chromosome reached 1000. The p-values and their corresponding false discovery rates (q-values) for the copy number gain or loss were calculated independently for each sliding window and assigned to the center position of corresponding sliding window. The survival difference was examined between samples that had gained or lost a chromosomal region (sliding window) and samples that had not using the method of Kaplan-Meier and the statistical significance was assessed by the log-rank test. The sliding window was identified as gained or lost if P-value < 10 âˆ’4 and Q-value < 10[suo]-3. Sliding windows whose gains or losses led to poor survival with log-rank test p-value < 0.5, corresponding q-value < 0.5, and happened to â‰¥ 10% of all samples were retained. Several regions of genomic gains and losses were significantly associated with poorer survival with 5 deletion hotspots common between the 2 datasets (Table). We validated the prognostic significance of these survival critical loci using FISH in an independent dataset of 169 patients treated with high dose therapy. Clustering of these survival critical loci revealed clusters of MM characterized by low, intermediate or high number of these abnormalities, which are independent of ploidy and translocations subtypes. These subgroups have significantly different survival. In addition, the clustering analysis suggests the chromosome 13 loss is an early event whereas chromosome 1 abnormalities are late events. Our strategy therefore identified novel regions of genomic aberration that are important prognostically. However, it is likely that these regions are manifestation of genomically unstable tumors with complex abnormalities that have poorer prognosis.

cd97c7835ccc1193c9aab0a79f8a3ab4e674829e,Abstract 2172: Earth mover's distance for the identification of genes associated with drug resistance in cancer,"Conventional methods for differential gene expression analysis perform well when intra-class heterogeneity is low and inter-class heterogeneity is high. However, many problems in biology and biomedicine, such as drug resistance in cancer, contain samples that show both significant intra- and inter-class heterogeneity. Conventional methods, which use means and variances to compute test statistics, lack power to identify genes differentially expressed between classes in these cases. To address this challenge, we developed EMDomics, a new method for differential gene expression analysis designed to perform well in the setting of intra-class heterogeneity. EMDomics uses the Earth mover9s distance (EMD) to measure the overall difference between the distribution of a gene9s expression in two classes of samples and uses permutations to estimate false discovery rates and obtain q-values for each gene. To evaluate the theoretical basis for EMDomics, we model heterogeneous mechanisms of drug resistance using simulated data and compare the performance of EMDomics to the commonly used conventional methods (SAM and Limma), in terms of sensitivity and specificity for identifying genes truly associated with drug resistance in the simulation. To test EMDomics on real biological data, we applied it to the challenging problem of identifying genes associated with drug response in ovarian cancer, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In both the simulated and real biological data, EMDomics outperformed the competing approaches for the identification of differentially expressed genes. Using simulated data, EMDomics yielded higher sensitivity and precision for highly heterogeneous data. Using real data, EMDomics was able to identify genes that are highly relevant for ovarian cancer biology, which were not identified by the conventional methods. Also, applying gene set enrichment analysis showed that most highly enriched gene sets includes pathways known to play critical roles in ovarian cancer pathogenesis. The most enriched gene set identified by the EMDomics analysis is a set of genes down-regulated in cancer cell lines with mutated TP53. Other gene sets identified as highly enriched by the EMDomics analysis, include gene sets related to LEF1, BMI1, KRAS, EZH2, and PTEN, and pathways related to cell-cell junction organization, cell-cell communication, WNT signaling, and extracellular matrix organization. EMDomics represents a new approach for the identification of genes differentially expressed between heterogeneous classes. It is a robust non-parametric method, which does not make any assumptions about the distributions or differences between the two classes being compared, and thus has significantly more power than conventional approaches for identifying differential â€˜Omics features between heterogeneous classes. The method can be applied in a wide variety of settings to compare distributions of â€˜Omics data between two classes.

53e85a72d93a6a09dae059d94d26f91292d73c2a,Genetic variants in SLC9A9 are associated with measures of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms in families.,"OBJECTIVE
A family was previously identified that cosegregates a pericentric inversion, inv(3)(p14 : q21), with an early-onset developmental condition, characterized by impulsive behavior and intellectual deficit. The inversion breakpoints lie within DOCK3 and SLC9A9 at the p-arm and q-arm, respectively. Based on this report, these genes were selected to be evaluated in a family-based attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) association study.


METHODS
Conners' Parent (CPRS) and Teacher (CTRS) Rating Scales of AD/HD symptoms and Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT) measures were collected and a minimal number of tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each gene were selected for analysis. Analyses were performed on families who met research criteria for AD/HD. Using the program, QTDT, each tagging SNP was tested for association with T-scores from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) subscales according to the CTRS and CPRS, and five CPT measures.


RESULTS
After adjusting for multiple testing, a SNP in the 3' UTR of SLC9A9, rs1046706, remained significantly associated (false discovery rate, q value <0.05) with scores on the DSM-IV hyperactive-impulsive and total symptom subscales according to the CTRS and errors of commission on the CPT. In addition, an intronic SLC9A9 SNP, rs2360867, remained significantly associated with errors of commission.


CONCLUSION
Our results suggest that SLC9A9 may be related to hyperactive-impulsive symptoms in AD/HD and the disruption of SLC9A9 may be responsible for the behavioral phenotype observed in the inversion family. The association with SLC9A9 is particularly interesting as it was recently implicated in a genome-wide association study for AD/HD. Further investigation of the role of SLC9A9 in AD/HD and other behavioral disorders is warranted.",2010,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Christina A Markunas"", ids = ""3708916""); list(name = ""Kaia S Quinn"", ids = ""7961573""); list(name = ""Ann L Collins"", ids = ""10916640""); list(name = ""Melanie E.

88bb461f0b64f168f407c97ab76be5b605b25199,An improved procedure for gene selection from microarray experiments using false discovery rate criterion,"BackgroundA large number of genes usually show differential expressions in a microarray experiment with two types of tissues, and the p-values of a proper statistical test are often used to quantify the significance of these differences. The genes with small p-values are then picked as the genes responsible for the differences in the tissue RNA expressions. One key question is what should be the threshold to consider the p-values small. There is always a trade off between this threshold and the rate of false claims. Recent statistical literature shows that the false discovery rate (FDR) criterion is a powerful and reasonable criterion to pick those genes with differential expression. Moreover, the power of detection can be increased by knowing the number of non-differential expression genes. While this number is unknown in practice, there are methods to estimate it from data. The purpose of this paper is to present a new method of estimating this number and use it for the FDR procedure construction.ResultsA combination of test functions is used to estimate the number of differentially expressed genes. Simulation study shows that the proposed method has a higher power to detect these genes than other existing methods, while still keeping the FDR under control. The improvement can be substantial if the proportion of true differentially expressed genes is large. This procedure has also been tested with good results using a real dataset.ConclusionFor a given expected FDR, the method proposed in this paper has better power to pick genes that show differentiation in their expression than two other well known methods.",2005,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""James J.

fd917ac733f8f0712305fcf2b1e911899d2457f0,Final Results Of Phase II Study Of Pomalidomide (Pom) In GEP-Defined High Risk Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM),"Background Pom is an IMiDÂ® immunomodulatory agent now FDA approved for treatment of patients who have received > 2 prior therapies, including lenalidomide (Len) and bortezomib (Bor), and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last line of therapy. There is limited data evaluating efficacy of Pom in high risk RRMM. Herein, we are reporting the final report on a phase II clinical trial employing Pom in high risk RRMM with prior exposure and/or refractoriness to Len. Methods High risk RRMM was defined by having high risk on gene expression profiling (GEP70 or GEP80 signatures), elevated LDH, or having abnormal metaphase cytogenetics. Cycle #1 Pom was given at 4mg orally Days 1-21 q 4 weeks; in the absence of > PR by IMWG criteria after 2 cycles, dexamethasone (Dex, 4-20 mg orally q week) and/or Bor (1.3 mg/m2 IV days 1,4,8,11) and/or Vorinostat (Vor, 100-200 mg po days 1-21 q 4 weeks) could be added; in the absence of > PR by IMWG criteria after 4 cycles, cyclophosphamide (Cy, 300 mg/m2 q week) could be added. Primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) at 1 year, secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), response rates and duration of response (DoR). Cox regression modeling was employed for univariate and multivariate analyses, Kaplan-Meier curves were used for OS and PFS. Best response was defined as the best response achieved while enrolled (regardless of prior progression, or relapse). Pharmacogenomic analyses using GEP were performed on 18 patients with paired baseline and 48hr post-Pom, using CD138-purified bone marrow plasma cells. Results 71 patients with HRMM were enrolled between May 2010 and August 2012. Baseline patient characteristics included age > 65 years in 45%, cytogenetic abnormalities (CA) in 86%, GEP70 high risk in 14/34 (41%), GEP80 high risk in 28/34 (82%), extramedullary disease in 3/71 (4%) and secondary plasma cell leukemia in 2/71 (3%). 68/71 patients (96%) had a prior autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), 30/71 (42%) had > 2 ASCT. Patients had received a median of 5 prior lines of therapy (range 1-10). There were 58 (82%) patients with Len-refractory (Len-R) MM, 64 (90%) with Bor-refractory (Bor-R) MM and 53 (75%) with dual-refractory (dual-R) MM prior to enrollment. 34 (48%) patients received > 6 cycles of treatment, 9(13%) received > 12 cycles. Patients who received > 6 cycles, had addition of Dex(67%), Bor+Dex(18%), Bor+Dex+Cy(12%), Bor+Dex+Cy+Vor(3%). As of July 2013, 45 patients (63%) discontinued therapy primarily due to progression or death. 20 (28%) patients achieved > PR as best response (1 Len-R, 2 Bor-R, 6 in dual-R), with median DoR for patients > PR of 1 month (range 0.5-18 months). 58 patients (5 Len-R, 8 Bor-R, 43 dual-R) had > stable disease, giving an overall disease control rate of 82%. Slight PFS benefit was observed in younger patients (HR=0.64, 95% CI: (0.39, 1.06), p=0.098). An increased risk for OS was observed among patients with LDH >= 190 U/L (HR=4.62, 95% CI: (2.28, 9.38), p = 8 mg/L (HR=2.13, 95% CI: (1.03, 4.40), p= 0.041), hemogloblin grade 3 were leukopenia (75%), thrombocytopenia (60%), anemia (44%), infections (26%), dyspnea (19%), hypophosphatemia (20%) and hypocalcemia (19%). OS and PFS at 12 months were 63% and 13%, respectively. Pre/48hr-post POM GEP analyses showed that expression levels of 55 probe-sets (48 genes) were significantly changed in response to POM treatment (false discovery rate 0.01). These genes were related to cell adhesion, inflammatory and hypersensitivity response, such as GAS6, ITGB1, ITGB7, LYN, RAC1, PYCARD, CORO1B, F11R, and DKK1, all with higher expression values observed post POM. IRF4, one of the targets of cereblon (CRBN) previously reported to be critical for myeloma cell survival, was down-regulated post POM treatment (p=0.001,FDR=0.09), suggesting a unique CRBN-dependent anti-myeloma activity for POM Conclusion Pom demonstrates good anti-myeloma activity in a heavily pretreated, GEP-defined high risk RRMM in combination with other anti-myeloma drugs. Given the efficacy in patients with poor prognostic features, there is precedence to evaluate Pom as an IMiD of choice in combination with other novel agents in front line setting for GEP-defined high risk MM.

Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 datasets provided a unique opportunity for participants to evaluate multiple testing strategies applicable to microarray and single nucleotide polymorphism data. The Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 multiple testing and false discovery rate group (Group 15) investigated three general categories for multiple testing corrections, which are summarized in this review: statistical independence, error rate adjustment, and data reduction.

b3e7cbb603d112249bfef710e4012012f9b55a6a,Sample Size Calculation for Microarray Studies with Survival Endpoints,"Oftentimes, we want to discover the genes whose expression levels are associated with a time-to-event endpoint, such as progression free survival or overall survival, through microarray studies. In this case, we need to adjust the false positivity in such discovery procedure for multiplicity of the genes using a multiple testing method. The most popular multiple testing methods used for gene discovery in microarray studies are to control the false discovery rate or the family wise error rate. In this paper, we review a FDR-control method to discover the genes associated with a time-to-event outcome and propose a sample size calculation method for microarray studies designed to discover genes whose expression levels are associated the chosen time-to-event outcome.

7917d66f9e8576fa69e7ef6df209b33fbf52b29c,Clustering of elderly patient subgroups to identify medication-related readmission risks,"INTRODUCTION
High Risk Medication Regimen (HRMR) scores are weakly predictive of hospital readmissions for elderly home health care patients. HRMR is composed of three elements related to drug risks: polypharmacy (number of medications); Potentially Inappropriate Medications (PIM) known to be harmful to the elderly; and the Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) that weighs drugs by the complexity of their dosing and instructions. In this paper, we hypothesized that HRMR scores are more predictive for demographic subgroups of elderly patients. The study used Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) variables to identify subgroups of patients for whom the HRMR measures appeared more predictive for hospital readmissions.


METHODS
OASIS and medication data were reused from a study of 911 patients (355 males, 556 females; mean age 78.9) from 15 Medicare-certified home health care agencies that established the relationship between HRMR and hospital readmissions. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering using the Jaccard distance measure and average-link method identified patient subgroups based on the OASIS data. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses evaluated the predictive strength of the HRMR variables for each subgroup. Additional False Discovery Rate (FDR) analyses assessed whether the clustered relationships were chance.


RESULTS
Clustering of OASIS data for 911 patients identified six subgroups: patients with Good Functional Status (n=382); Females with Moderate to Severe Pain (n=354); patients with poor prognosis needing functional status assistance (n=419); patients with Poor Functional Status (n=287); Males with Adult Children as Caregiver (n=198); adults living alone with spouses as primary caregiver (n=127). ROC results relating these subgroups to HRMR risks were strongest for Males with Adult Children as Caregivers (AUC: polypharmacy, 0.73; PIM, 0.64; MRCI, 0.77). The findings for this subgroup also met the FDR analysis threshold (<=0.20).


CONCLUSIONS
A risk of medication-related readmissions in elderly men with adult children as caregivers is consistent with research showing problems in medication adherence when seniors are supported by informal caregivers. The results from clustering analysis present a hypothesis for research on HRMR and on the relationship between adult caregivers and their fathers.",2016,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Catherine H.

In this paper we focus on dose-response experiments within a microarray setting in which several microarrays are available for a sequence of increasing dose levels. A gene is called differentially expressed if there is a monotonic trend (with respect to dose) in the gene expression. We review several testing procedures which can be used in order to test equality among the gene expression means against ordered alternatives with respect to dose, namely Williams' (Williams 1971 and 1972), Marcus' (Marcus 1976), global likelihood ratio test (Bartholomew 1961, Barlow et al. 1972, and Robertson et al. 1988), and M (Hu et al. 2005) statistics. Additionally we introduce a modification to the standard error of the M statistic. We compare the performance of these five test statistics. Moreover, we discuss the issue of one-sided versus two-sided testing procedures. False Discovery Rate (Benjamni and Hochberg 1995, Ge et al. 2003), and resampling-based Familywise Error Rate (Westfall and Young 1993) are used to handle the multiple testing issue. The methods above are applied to a data set with 4 doses (3 arrays per dose) and 16,998 genes. Results on the number of significant genes from each statistic are discussed. A simulation study is conducted to investigate the power of each statistic. A R library IsoGene implementing the methods is available from the first author.",2007,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Lin Dan"", ids = ""2127096""); list(name = ""Shkedy Ziv"", ids = ""84128712""); list(name = ""Yekutieli Dani"", ids = ""103090343""); list(name = ""Burzykowski Tomasz"", ids = ""47819061""); list(name = ""GÃ¶hlmann Hinrich W.H."", ids = ""1451972609""); list(name = ""An de Bondt"", ids = ""48971943""); list(name = ""Perera Tim"", ids = ""153177494""); list(name = ""G Gubanova Tamara"", ids = ""102592462""); list(name = ""Bijnens Luc"", ids = ""103362479"")",a3e6a17764c9470ea1c56710bd8ae4237bd17c79; 064b75c26c765ec906c108213e7a132411a35f81; 189803d126fa4db0616ba047ef5216ae6da48576; d3ff88a3f1fbd8bb013bd8318b7f8c0650a64349; c20bb668484e2091ea86a0749785117d6062fa82; 9bf0123dca62945783a55a99d712e93357a38539; f3c9d03a37b01af367ee862d0ea741f7966f7e96; 3904fca47c17051c6aad7210a00cb30d514d735e; 2a5b7320025982d9923a91ac11f76b51884b54d8; 82794089ce0299f973e1355921a803bc1e041eda; 28be04e9e1eae100ec9bc37cc182823df9eae730; 25a63948cdeac2ac78fda3f4cec2231aa85c3cba; 83404c3ae5b4137add77a7f94c090248b2eda052; c2c7c7d4b974289a37bf6fbf1ab46a30a50e16a7; 0ff9d49fd9c03b4974a01ca1f0f13d750cda13b2,,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology,6,1-28
8061d96e5c47eb675dc34ba92b26be81a0968869,Inflammatory Biomarkers and Mortality Risk Among HIV-Suppressed Men: A Multisite Prospective Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced inflammation and immune activation persist after initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and HIV suppression and may contribute to mortality risks that exceed those in HIV-uninfected populations, though associations are unclear.


METHODS
In the prospective Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, comprising men who have sex with men from Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh, concentrations of 24 biomarkers of inflammation and immune activation were measured in stored serum from HIV-positive men obtained after cART-induced HIV suppression between 1996 and 2009. The outcome was nonaccidental death, with follow-up until 2014. We used Cox proportional hazards models to test whether biomarker concentrations predict time from HIV suppression to death and adjusted for multiple tests. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed to identify groupings of biomarkers that predict mortality risk.


RESULTS
Of 670 men followed up from HIV suppression, 54 died by the end of 2013. After adjustment for age, CD4(+) cell count, hepatitis B or C virus infection, and smoking, concentrations in the highest quartile of 4 biomarkers were significantly associated with mortality risk after controlling the false discovery rate at 5%: interleukin (IL) 6 (hazard ratio, 3.54; 95% confidence interval, 2.06-6.10), soluble IL 2RÎ± (3.29, 1.85-5.85), soluble CD14 (2.67, 1.55-4.61), and chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13; 2.26; 1.29-3.95). EFA yielded 2 biomarker groupings that were independent predictors of mortality risk.


CONCLUSIONS
Despite having undetectable HIV RNA levels during cART, men with higher concentrations of several biomarkers (particularly IL 6, soluble IL 2RÎ±, soluble CD14, and CXCL13) had higher hazards of long-term mortality. Correlations observed among biomarker concentrations may represent underlying inflammatory processes that contribute to mortality risk.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Nikolas I Wada"", ids = ""31664605""); list(name = ""Jay H.

40db45681ce8b0216ebb1f5ffc2d220f49dcbb07,Validating Methods that Promote Reduction and Refinement in Laboratory Animal Science,"Validating Methods that Promote Reduction and Refinement in Laboratory Animal Science Michael Walker Advisor: University of Guelph, 2016 Professor Georgia Mason Millions of animals are used in biomedical research each year. Unfortunately, much of the research performed on them is likely spurious and non-replicable, making their use ethically questionable. There is, thus, an ethical imperative to improve the quality of scientific research being conducted, in addition to the well-known mandates to reduce the number of animals being used, and to improve the welfare of those individuals that are being used. In this work I contribute to these obligations by first validating â€˜mixedstrain housingâ€™: an example of a split-plot experimental design that allows many fewer animals to be used without compromising statistical power. Accordingly, no welfare issues were created by housing mice of different strains together, nor were there adverse effects in terms of data quality. Furthermore, when mice of different coat colours are housed together, they no longer need to be individually identified via aversive marking techniques. I then implement this housing paradigm successfully when validating that crossing a floor electrified by increasing magnitude of current represents a perceived cost for mice, and as such that it can then be used to measure motivation by assessing how much they would be â€˜willing to payâ€™ to access preferred resources. I highlight the potential advantages this has over other means of imposing resource access costs, and then implement it when assessing mouse preferences for two commercially available running wheels: Bio ServÂ®â€˜s â€˜fast-tracâ€™ wheel combo and a stainless steel mesh 5â€ upright wheel by Ware Manufacturing Inc. In addition, the welfare significance and anatomical impact of the two wheels are quantified, and I ultimately recommend that of the two, the â€˜fast-tracâ€™ wheel is better for laboratory mice. Finally, I argue that the false discovery rate of a test is much more meaningful and informative than a p-value, and demonstrate how exactly the (expected) false discovery rate can be used to plan experiments that are likely to find significant effects while avoiding spurious results, thus ensuring that animals are not being wasted. Overall, this thesis provides validated methods that contribute to the ongoing goals of reduction and refinement.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Michael Walker"", ids = ""143614809"")",,5c3039c987cb43c6f765f0a0bbcfd5ca168c25d3;

f71c4b7a26970b598a40fecb3d6d68b8dcf861e1,Differentially expressed genes for aggressive pecking behaviour in laying hens,"BackgroundAggressive behaviour is an important aspect in the daily lives of animals living in groups. Aggressive animals have advantages, such as better access to food or territories, and they produce more offspring than low ranking animals. The social hierarchy in chickens is measured using the 'pecking order' concept, which counts the number of aggressive pecks given and received. To date, little is known about the underlying genetics of the 'pecking order'.ResultsA total of 60 hens from a high feather pecking selection line were divided into three groups: only receivers (R), only peckers (P) and mixed peckers and receivers (P&R). In comparing the R and P groups, we observed that there were 40 differentially expressed genes [false discovery rate (FDR) P < 0.10]. It was not fully clear how the 40 genes regulated aggressive behaviour; however, gene set analysis detected a number of GO identifiers, which were potentially involved in aggressive behavioural processes. These genes code for synaptosomes (GO:0019797), and proteins involved in the regulation of the excitatory postsynaptic membrane potential (GO:0060079), the regulation of the membrane potential (GO:0042391), and glutamate receptor binding (GO:0035254).ConclusionIn conclusion, our study provides new insights into which genes are involved in aggressive behaviours in chickens. Pecking and receiving hens exhibited different gene expression profiles in their brains. Following confirmation, the identification of differentially expressed genes may elucidate how the pecking order forms in laying hens at a molecular level.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Bart Buitenhuis"", ids = ""6917179""); list(name = ""Jakob Hedegaard"", ids = ""49808786""); list(name = ""Luc Janss"", ids = ""144084022""); list(name = ""Peter SÃ¸rensen"", ids = ""147845011"")",8f27e2a4d5b740b0ca5076ecd665ad8d787b7645; f350319ba6f4234a8e1bfb969a782825364bb533; 699782739394d6b930fd0a83c3ae49480cae5189; 3a8034b0cfba037c7362d169086d0845a9fbe587; 6da6e7377855786282adc30c85368b6e36209e80; d386bc0948972d3a0fc65c93ad47a05bdd062035; 02c7e0f9b0eb802a8492f415b5ab3f243c0c055a; 25051efd72c1dc66e846b7bde4d2a31fa2c00f40; 66ae38f6ac15b164e57c8cb3cf25e81c19a8dee2; 4c483fe2ec05b7f699ee26c171f4a130604001fa; 71b78c4f7251768bf5e978e12f7ca787bbb91030; dd7b1f204ca4a0fd11d0c85e852b22c37b1467f3; 9080fd6bc483918c59dff32c5d27806bcf1d699f; c2fdf16a258288b745b52baf5f73ad98ad863bcd,a31cd775fdc1fbd7ae41d01c573e5c977f13313e; 30eed4c366e1302a974174a4f24a6aed3c37868c; 3f783ea76261a30af41d538d98a1769df215efce; a707b30842179fbcb2e3d25a97d1cd509ab01379; 46eddbc819bbbaa85ebd76c5615b64b585fb909e; 1087cf08f24fc8ccc7d3179c1655c8de9eb4017d; 8c10dca89614a24bd22c1a14ded78cd380fbb941; 4fa09a3b77a45e63da59e3a668d71be62632b031; 90a9415ff57e3ffcfebee7dc4df69ed320d6a8d6; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; 3098dad15a19cf0097311caa4841fc16d525f23e; b7560d71ab237b78e1ebfd8512181b76546937d0; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; dc321b9c204f3a9aba922bd72cc20ed3f9de1652; 0ece893a1b7cd7a7aac506a3be5a262fb2b60776; 251e40a3502ff24f7b1ccdba4d8e50f7b3472727; e4919f66b84a7489600f0dd57240361357d825d7; bd008e136c562452c48f302e642d25fc0d064183; 9019c8c8eca671a9ff5c8f5084177c7bfcbe1abf; 13258af7d661c0fadfccea1d0aa3c73cef8027b9; af657253a6c84658fb110fe7cd1e13bb8e362230; 826b3f54d737b28a9e2e06304f0966884f8e3fc7; 67ecf8e0df66b9248add0ba356d9995ef1272dbd; 2bcdcc7094691820b2f33d042df9503b2b5c89b6; 99187f7004c85218247e7c4bc43b644e3317d125; a16d630d7314bb347de3a288fd70c92be2e2b931; f0452d26f4f83eceea10251514c3a8163a3560e9; 290a35faaa4f688b48af8af8dcce1426e83991ee; 1037548f688bd3e566df0d4184509976695124cf; 2d03f13272d0b57b7395edd3861a6d759f85f0f6; 7225ff02ac97d0c4dcdee8393ed5ce29ab989197,BMC Genomics,10,544 - 544
5e46b9a7da5078b662eaab8754f71d85b687055e,Identification of rare DNA variants in mitochondrial disorders with improved array-based sequencing,"A common goal in the discovery of rare functional DNA variants via medical resequencing is to incur a relatively lower proportion of false positive base-calls. We developed a novel statistical method for resequencing arrays (SRMA, sequence robust multi-array analysis) to increase the accuracy of detecting rare variants and reduce the costs in subsequent sequence verifications required in medical applications. SRMA includes single and multi-array analysis and accounts for technical variables as well as the possibility of both low- and high-frequency genomic variation. The confidence of each base-call was ranked using two quality measures. In comparison to Sanger capillary sequencing, we achieved a false discovery rate of 2% (false positive rate 1.2 Ã— 10â»âµ, false negative rate 5%), which is similar to automated second-generation sequencing technologies. Applied to the analysis of 39 nuclear candidate genes in disorders of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance, we confirmed mutations in the DNA polymerase gamma POLG in positive control cases, and identified novel rare variants in previously undiagnosed cases in the mitochondrial topoisomerase TOP1MT, the mismatch repair enzyme MUTYH, and the apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease APEX2. Some patients carried rare heterozygous variants in several functionally interacting genes, which could indicate synergistic genetic effects in these clinically similar disorders.",2011,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Wenyi Wang"", ids = ""145417213""); list(name = ""Peidong Shen"", ids = ""2629754""); list(name = ""Sreedevi Thiyagarajan"", ids = ""2364439""); list(name = ""Shengrong Lin"", ids = ""48639826""); list(name = ""Curtis J.

6ffa5afc28f8d06bffd234edd2d0612cf2b30597,Proteomic analysis reveals perturbed energy metabolism and elevated oxidative stress in hearts of rats with inborn low aerobic capacity.,"Selection on running capacity has created rat phenotypes of high-capacity runners (HCRs) that have enhanced cardiac function and low-capacity runners (LCRs) that exhibit risk factors of metabolic syndrome. We analysed hearts of HCRs and LCRs from generation 22 of selection using DIGE and identified proteins from MS database searches. The running capacity of HCRs was six-fold greater than LCRs. DIGE resolved 957 spots and proteins were unambiguously identified in 369 spots. Protein expression profiling detected 67 statistically significant (p<0.05; false discovery rate <10%, calculated using q-values) differences between HCRs and LCRs. Hearts of HCR rats exhibited robust increases in the abundance of each enzyme of the Î²-oxidation pathway. In contrast, LCR hearts were characterised by the modulation of enzymes associated with ketone body or amino acid metabolism. LCRs also exhibited enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and greater phosphorylation of Î± B-crystallin at serine 59, which is a common point of convergence in cardiac stress signalling. Thus, proteomic analysis revealed selection on low running capacity is associated with perturbations in cardiac energy metabolism and provided the first evidence that the LCR cardiac proteome is exposed to greater oxidative stress.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jatin G Burniston"", ids = ""2612777""); list(name = ""Jenna Kenyani"", ids = ""5637696""); list(name = ""Jonathan M.

98d4ecb74f559c1164a381104417ea758e6b109f,Genetic variants in telomereâ€maintenance genes are associated with ovarian cancer risk and outcome,"Most ovarian cancer patients present at an advanced stage with poor prognosis. Telomeres play a critical role in protecting chromosomes stability. The associations of genetic variants in telomere maintenance genes and ovarian cancer risk and outcome are unclear. We genotyped 137 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in telomere-maintenance genes in 417 ovarian cancer cases and 417 matched healthy controls to evaluate their associations with cancer risk, survival and therapeutic response. False discovery rate Q-value was calculated to account for multiple testing. Eleven SNPs from two genes showed nominally significant associations with the risks of ovarian cancer. The most significant SNP was TEP1: rs2228026 with participants carrying at least one variant allele exhibiting a 3.28-fold (95% CI: 1.72-6.29; P < 0.001, Q = 0.028) increased ovarian cancer risk, which remained significant after multiple testing adjusting. There was also suggested evidence for the associations of SNPs with outcome, although none of the associations had a Q < 0.05. Seven SNPs from two genes showed associations with ovarian cancer survival (P < 0.05). The strongest association was found in TNKS gene (rs10093972, hazard ratio = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.20-2.92; P = 0.006, Q = 0.076). Five SNPs from four genes showed suggestive associations with therapeutic response (P < 0.05). In a survival tree analysis, TEP1:rs10143407 was the primary factor contributing to overall survival. Unfavourable genotype analysis showed a cumulative effect of significant SNPs on ovarian cancer risk, survival and therapeutic response.

We examined gene expression in Spragueâ€“Dawley (susceptible) and Fischer 344 (resistant) neonatal rats after 3Â days exposure to cyclic hyperoxia or room air, using Affymetrix rat Genearrays. False discovery rate analysis was used to identify differentially regulated genes. Such genes were then ranked by fold change and submitted to the online database, DAVID. The Spragueâ€“Dawley list returned the term â€œresponse to hypoxia,â€ absent from the Fischer 344 output. Manual analysis indicated that many genes known to be upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± were downregulated by cyclic hyperoxia. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of Egln3, Bnip3, Slc16a3, and Hk2 confirmed the microarray results.

f0a70e8e9ff6f7a0268aa396f205f8d7bdbd2d77,A whole genome sequence association study of muscle fiber traits in a White Duroc Ã— Erhualian F2 resource population.,"Objective
Muscle fiber types, numbers and area are crucial aspects associated with meat production and quality. However, there are few studies of pig muscle fibre traits in terms of the detection power, false discovery rate and confidence interval precision of whole-genome quantitative trait loci (QTL). We had previously performed genome scanning for muscle fibre traits using 183 microsatellites and detected 8 significant QTLs in a White Duroc Ã— Erhualian F2 population. The confidence intervals of these QTLs ranged between 11 and 127 cM, which contained hundreds of genes and hampered the identification of QTLs. A whole-genome sequence imputation of the population was used for fine mapping in this study.


Methods
A whole-genome sequences association study was performed in the F2 population. Genotyping was performed for 1,020 individuals (19 F0, 68 F1 and 933 F2). The whole-genome variants were imputed and 21,624,800 SNPs were identified and examined for associations to 11 longissimus dorsi muscle fiber traits.


Results
A total of 3201 significant SNPs comprising 7 novel QTLs showing associations with the relative area of fiber type I (I_RA), the fiber number per square centimeter (FN) and the total fiber number (TFN). Moreover, one QTL on pig chromosome 14 was found to affect both FN and TFN. Furthermore, four plausible candidate genes associated with FN (KNDC1), TFN ( KNDC1) and I_RA (SLC36A4, CNTNAP5 and GRM8) were identified.


Conclusion
An efficient and powerful imputation-based association approach was utilized to identify genes potentially associated with muscle fiber traits. These identified genes and SNPs could be explored to improve meat production and quality via marker-assisted selection in pigs.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Tianfu Guo"", ids = ""152173393""); list(name = ""Jun Gao"", ids = ""144717770""); list(name = ""Bin Yang"", ids = ""50699350""); list(name = ""Guorong Yan"", ids = ""10688182""); list(name = ""Shijun Xiao"", ids = ""33263035""); list(name = ""Zhiyan Zhang"", ids = ""32272323""); list(name = ""Lusheng Huang"", ids = ""18307877"")",,,Asian-Australasian journal of animal sciences,,
f6cac1c427845e189d2f4a5c12aed9852e9ee511,Exploiting sample variability to enhance multivariate analysis of microarray data,"MOTIVATION
Biological and technical variability is intrinsic in any microarray experiment. While most approaches aim to account for this variability, they do not actively exploit it. Here, we consider a novel approach that uses the variability between arrays to provide an extra source of information that can enhance gene expression analyses.


RESULTS
We develop a method that uses sample similarity to incorporate sample variability into the analysis of gene expression profiles. This allows each pairwise correlation calculation to borrow information from all the data in the experiment. Results on synthetic and human cancer microarray datasets show that the inclusion of this information leads to a significant increase in the ability to identify previously characterized relationships and a reduction in false discovery rate, when compared to a standard analysis using Pearson correlation. The information carried by the variability between arrays can be exploited to significantly improve the analysis of gene expression data.

Like hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), leukemia stem cells are believed to be largely quiescent and therefore impervious to conventional chemotherapeutics resulting in relapse of disease despite achievement of clinical remission. The DNA methylation profiles of bulk leukemia cells differ significantly from normal CD34+ cells; however, less is known about the potential differences between epigenetic profiles of purified LSC and normal HSC. Moreover, the stability of the methylome as the LSC differentiate into mature leukemia progenitor cells (LPC) has not been studied. In order to address this LSC, LPC, and HSC were sorted from the bone marrow of AML patients and normal controls based on CD34, CD38, CD45 and ALDH activity. LSC were defined as CD34+ CD38- ALDHmid; LPC as CD34+ CD38+; and HSC as CD34+ CD38- ALDHhigh. These isolated fractions were used for genome-wide DNA methylation analysis by the next-generation enhanced reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (ERRBS) assay, which allowed for the comparison of the methylation landscapes of LSC and HSC, as well as those of LSC and LPC. A total of thirteen AML samples were examined for the presence of LSC, six of which did not have an ALDHmid population but had instead an ALDHhigh population. Because of their phenotypic similarity to normal HSC, these samples were not included in the present comparison against HSC. The methylomes of six independent LSC samples were compared to methylomes of five HSC. Sequenced ERRBS libraries were aligned against the human genome (hg19) and differentially methylated regions (DMR) were identified using a beta-binomial model and selecting regions with absolute mean methylation difference of >25% and false discovery rate (FDR) Disclosures Gore:Celgene: Consultancy, Honoraria, Research Funding.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Lauren Suarez"", ids = ""51319852""); list(name = ""Tingting Qin"", ids = ""49725838""); list(name = ""Kristen M Meldi"", ids = ""4376636""); list(name = ""Manjusha Thakar"", ids = ""41018315""); list(name = ""Sarah Sakoian"", ids = ""11249046""); list(name = ""Jonathan M.

7cc2a718b53809504fcacdb4d54c0164c9c42604,RANK/RANKL/OPG gene polymorphisms and loss of orthodontic mini-implants.,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the association of genetic polymorphisms (tagSNPs type) of RANK/RANKL/OPG genes with the loss of orthodontic mini-implants (MIs).


SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION
135 patients of both sexes, with mean age of 48.7 Â± 10 (20 to 76 years) were studied. The control group was composed of 104 patients, with no MI lost and functioning for at least 6 months and the case group, of 31 patients with at least one MI lost.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells were obtained by mouthwash with 3% glucose solution for 1 minute and scraping the buccal mucosa with sterilized spatula. DNA was extracted from buccal epithelial cells with 10 M ammonium acetate and 1 mM EDTA. Genotyping was performed by the Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique. Univariate and multivariate analyzes were performed (p<0.05).


RESULTS
No markers were associated with MI loss after Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction of Univariate tests. In the multivariate analysis, the variables that associated with MI loss were the number of MIs installed (p<0.000) and the polymorphism rs8086340 in the RANK gene (p=0.018).

118e463480948ca6919c8842d35f6ca79710a114,Physiogenomic comparison of edema and BMI in patients receiving rosiglitazone or pioglitazone.,"BACKGROUND
The thiazolidinediones (TZDs) improve tissue sensitivity to insulin in patients with type II diabetes, resulting in reduced levels of fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin. However, TZDs unpredictably demonstrate adverse effects of increased body weight, fluid retention, and edema. The balance of efficacy and safety of TZD varies widely from patient to patient. Genetic variability may reveal pathophysiological pathways underlying weight gain associated with TZD therapy and due to adiposity and/or edema.


METHODS
We analyzed 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 222 cardiovascular and metabolic genes in 87 outpatients with type 2 diabetes receiving thiazolidinedione therapy. Physiogenomic analysis was used to discover associations with body mass index (BMI) and edema.


RESULTS
The 5 most significant gene associations found between BMI and SNPs were ADORA1, adenosine A1 receptor (rs903361, p<0.0003), PKM2, pyruvate kinase-muscle (rs2856929, p<0.002); ADIPOR2, adiponectin receptor 2 (rs7975375, p<0.007); UCP2, uncoupling protein 2 (rs660339, p<0.008); and APOH, apolipoprotein H (rs8178847, p<0.010). For edema, the 5 most significant gene associations were NPY, neuropeptide Y (rs1468271, p<0.006); GYS1, glycogen synthase 1-muscle (rs2287754, p<0.013); CCL2, chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (rs3760396, p<0.015); OLR1, oxidized LDL receptor 1 (rs2742115, p<0.015); and GHRH, growth hormone releasing hormone (rs6032470, p<0.023). After accounting for multiple comparisons, ADORA1 was significantly associated with BMI at a false discovery rate (FDR) of <10%.


CONCLUSION
Physiogenomic associations were discovered suggesting mechanistic links between adenosine signaling and BMI, and between vascular permeability and drug-induced edema.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Gualberto RuanÌƒo"", ids = ""3920238""); list(name = ""James Bernene"", ids = ""49248340""); list(name = ""Andreas Windemuth"", ids = ""2284907""); list(name = ""Bruce Bower"", ids = ""31266202""); list(name = ""Detlef Wencker"", ids = ""8977777""); list(name = ""Richard L.

1394c83b777b8b1ccd274e16de9a5187997f6232,Abstract 3609: Differential gene expression is associated with response to chemoradiation and relapse-free and overall survival in rectal adenocarcinoma,"Background: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation is a standard therapy for stage II-III rectal adenocarcinoma, and the degree of pathologic response observed upon resection informs prognosis. However, there is a need to identify novel biomarkers of response to chemoradiation and survival after chemoradiation, particularly using modern next-generation sequencing methods. Methods: We prospectively collected pretreatment endoscopic tumor biopsies from 43 patients with stage II-IV rectal adenocarcinoma prior to neoadjuvant chemoradiation with concurrent fluoropyrimidine. Tumor samples were fresh frozen, and subsequently RNA was extracted, paired end libraries for mRNA sequencing (RNASeq) were prepared using TruSeq RNA Access library prep kits (Illumina), and samples were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq. Differentially expressed genes were determined using DESeq2 and Ingenuity pathway analysis (Qiagen) was performed. Additionally, the association between â€œclaudin-lowâ€-like gene sets established in breast and bladder cancers and clinical outcomes was determined. Results: Among the 36 patients with adequate RNA quality, 7 had a pathologic complete response (pCR) and 29 did not, with 22 differentially expressed genes with false discovery rate (FDR) Conclusions: There are multiple differentially expressed genes associated with response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation in rectal adenocarcinoma. EME2, which forms an endonuclease that cleaves stalled replication forks, was one of the most differentially expressed genes overexpressed in patients with pathologic complete response and thus is a rational target for further investigation. Extension of â€œclaudin-lowâ€ gene expression signatures to rectal cancers may serve as a new prognostic biomarker. Further investigation into the association of gene expression subtypes and responses to neoadjuvant chemoradiation is warranted. Citation Format: Michael S. Lee, Cheryl Carlson, Benjamin F.

b5c5027dbde0dc500f254300f8cb9b10d4580b9d,Sat0001 Fosl-2 Is a Repressor of Foxp3 Expression during Treg Development and Controls Autoimmunity,"Background Fos like 2 (Fosl-2) is a transcription factor belonging to the AP-1 transcription complex. We have recently described a Fosl-2 transgenic (tg) mouse model which develops a multi-organ inflammatory and autoimmune phenotype. In these mice, we have characterized a decrease in regulatory T cells (Tregs), which preceded the activation of T cells and the development of inflammation. Objectives To analyze how Fosl-2 reduces the Treg population and triggers autoimmunity in Fosl-2 tg mice. Methods We used previously generated Fosl-2 tg overexpressing and Fosl-2 T cell specific knock out (Fosl-2 ko) mice. For mixed bone marrow transfer experiments, lethally irradiated recipients received a one to one mix of Fosl-2 tg (CD45.2) and wt (CD45.1) bone marrow to create Fosl-2 tg-wt chimera. We addressed the contribution of Tregs to the inflammatory phenotype by co-transferring Fosl-2 tg CD4 T cells and wt Tregs to Rag2-/- recipients. Treg and T cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry and inflammation was addressed by CD45 staining on paraffin-embedded sections. RNA-sequencing was used to compare wt, Fosl-2 tg and Fosl-2 ko CD4 T cells after 24 hours of stimulation with anti-CD3 (2Î¼g/ml) and anti-CD28 (2Î¼g/ml). Results We first addressed whether Fosl-2 affected Tregs in a cell intrinsic way using mixed bone marrow experiments. In these animals, the CD45.2 Fosl-2 tg CD4 T cells showed a much lower proportion of Tregs compared to the CD45.1 wt population, both in the spleen (0.73%Â±0.15 vs 31.6%Â±3.6, P=0.062) and thymus (1.3%Â±1.04 vs 3.23%Â±0.78, P=0.001). This demonstrates that Fosl-2 overexpression represses Treg development in a cell intrinsic way. In T cell transfer experiments, Rag2-/- mice receiving 106 Fosl-2 tg CD4 cells developed lung inflammation 5 weeks after transfer, confirming that T cells are inducers of inflammation in Fosl-2 tg mice. Moreover, co-transfer of either 3*105 or 106 wt Treg cells resulted in a dose dependent reduction of inflammation. These data indicated that the decrease in the Treg population in Fosl-2 tg mice is responsible for the induction of inflammation. We then analysed Fosl-2 transcriptional targets in T cells by RNA-seq. Using a fold change > 1.5 and False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 0.05, we identified 191 differentially expressed genes in both Fosl-2 tg and Fosl-2 ko cells compared to wt. Interestingly, one of the top target genes of Fosl-2 was FoxP3. This unbiased approach thus revealed that FoxP3 expression is repressed by Fosl-2, with a 6.5 fold reduction in Fosl-2 tg cells and a 2.5 fold increase in Fosl-2 ko cells. This effect was confirmed on the protein level with a reduction in FoxP3 induction in Fosl-2 tg cells treated with TGFÎ². The repression of Treg development observed in Fosl-2 tg mice could thus be explained by a direct transcriptional control of FoxP3 expression. Additionally, we found that Fosl-2 repressed a set of genes important for Tregs and other T helper cells. This included Nr4a2, a transcription factor involved in Treg development, IRF8 and Eomes, two genes involved in the polarization of Th1 and Th17 cells, or Ccl1 a chemokine important for Treg homeostasis. Conclusion Fosl-2 is involved in the control of FoxP3 expression in T cells. Through this, overexpression of Fosl-2 represses Treg development and induces a Treg dependent autoimmune phenotype in mice. This mechanism could thus be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and might represent a therapeutic target to modulate the Treg population.

Using the false discovery rate methodology of Storey (2002) to estimate the percentage of stocks for which the model yields correct VaR and ES forecasts, we conclude that there is no difference in performance between updating the parameter estimates of the GARCH equation at a daily or weekly frequency, whereas monthly or even quarterly updates are only marginally outperformed.",2014,Economics,"list(name = ""David Ardia"", ids = ""2181735""); list(name = ""Lennart Hoogerheide"", ids = ""2328120"")",69c907796cb63349ca88be29114c06e7a39e51f6; 0f2575d2c310bbe98f8179d0afac6ded6fe12eb1; 9a69edf297b86ce0e28568d8869572052a1b2aac; 93a33689efa86ab96a7b2afb64524d1bc95c9f08; fcc294662ded1a76a9b25b8fad42cea911e4c442; 023308ded345742216904015b23a97d5912906c8; a042729ce5065401f5e31561f7b42b27b81d3680; 605b10c130815f17c11e64d2a924e188cff859d2; 3f15c88eb98d45c5939831eca9b24dab87febbca,18fac2225f6d627d99794119d558380c15eb13ee; b91c61c30d3dbe37601984cd6bdd06882d052c29; f6333c57973e98972c03d8a1f9d99c9c3ae0aa64; 144cfd556934cd23b3a65b0ebe18ee16a09b1098; 304b2f737c10213cebdb044e3c4d3d9bb0dbcca9; c474cc43d8294ef7340f615a429f5085df624051; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; d98a3337597e80dd26f37af446ee37936150e6a3; 75f8a4d7ed6a0f32fa098cac967de247938d9ce5; 4e4cf1e91852964ed44a4d74ba88460741aee6f4; 02def074ade26646f5dfc8c2909ecb012a1fc8e6; aa77bef62d295107d2a66657c4ee60938ad72c43; ffc8464348708fac31d21559da3681bf973729f8; a0eb36a3cdb045b5923ec3065c9c3314bf28dbe4; e95acbaecc63f4d066e2fe9bc77243990ab4d7c5; 897e7112c2b2c3aac35db9f7617c448462629137; 2d174c122dce747449d1cd796bd319e838d7468e; 5a1374ba12ea2ebda21db13fe0731ff20f82ac50; 34e2209927b313c5821abf70de2b2453fdc48bcb; c488cff03bdb2281e0345b5fd9095a376ad41c58; 584c7954ebb89d6155fa50e5bcf44098fb881faa; 224f336fc25061fe0c1d4cd80cb3c50337e15d62; c32b17938147ead58fab3379f4d900affabcf92c; 08ab9e7999e54dfb3f3186cfef2839a5e644022e; 15345dd0a431530b4d94494b4a0a73033887b64d; 459d1316507689cdc0976d367bafc4e4df973d14; 8a1220d4acd8ae684401c3431627948c0f5b6a93; e080b703166fed7b9a7f758f9a1478764b9a6189; 79660d55060562ce34a5d06f1811cde092594861; c3677675afa1362793833b241ba66234f3193467; d0520f11b55392c010fa048e3186b7512ef9e9e9,Economics Letters,123,187-190

Abstract: The incidence of scrotal hernias in pigs is a concern to the pig industry due to the significant economic losses and the negative impact on welfare. The genetic pathways and genes involved in this pathology remain unknown. To better understand the genetic mechanisms involved in the occurrence of scrotal hernia in pigs, the aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes between normal and affected pigs with this anomaly, using RNA-Seq technology. In this study, Landrace pigs were used (4 normal and 4 with scrotal hernia). Sequencing of mRNA was performed in the Illumina HiSeq 2500 equipment. Differentially expressed genes were obtained using the EdgeR package, based on the False Discovery Rate (FDRâ‰¤0.05). A total of 13,035 genes were found to be expressed in the hernial and nonhernial tissue. From those, 644 differentially expressed genes were identified between normal and affected pigs. After gene ontology analyses, some candidate genes were prospected. The knowledge of the genes that control this disorder could support breeding strategies for reducing this anomaly in the pig production.",2017,Geography,"list(name = ""Gabriela S.

4e6eea0161e8020a77a3da8dfbdcce21f159a65c,Mixture drug-count response model for the high-dimensional drug combinatory effect on myopathy.,"Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a common cause of adverse drug events (ADEs). The electronic medical record (EMR) database and the FDA's adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database are the major data sources for mining and testing the ADE associated DDI signals. Most DDI data mining methods focus on pair-wise drug interactions, and methods to detect high-dimensional DDIs in medical databases are lacking. In this paper, we propose 2 novel mixture drug-count response models for detecting high-dimensional drug combinations that induce myopathy. The ""count"" indicates the number of drugs in a combination. One model is called fixed probability mixture drug-count response model with a maximum risk threshold (FMDRM-MRT). The other model is called count-dependent probability mixture drug-count response model with a maximum risk threshold (CMDRM-MRT), in which the mixture probability is count dependent. Compared with the previous mixture drug-count response model (MDRM) developed by our group, these 2 new models show a better likelihood in detecting high-dimensional drug combinatory effects on myopathy. CMDRM-MRT identified and validated (54; 374; 637; 442; 131) 2-way to 6-way drug interactions, respectively, which induce myopathy in both EMR and FAERS databases. We further demonstrate FAERS data capture much higher maximum myopathy risk than EMR data do.

669a8ac03a28b23ba078caef86db5e47ec61de98,Bagged Empirical Null p-values: A Method to Account for Model Uncertainty in Large Scale Inference,"When conducting large scale inference, such as genome-wide association studies or image analysis, nominal $p$-values are often adjusted to improve control over the family-wise error rate (FWER). When the majority of tests are null, procedures controlling the False discovery rate (Fdr) can be improved by replacing the theoretical global null with its empirical estimate. However, these other adjustment procedures remain sensitive to the working model assumption. Here we propose two key ideas to improve inference in this space. First, we propose $p$-values that are standardized to the empirical null distribution (instead of the theoretical null). Second, we propose model averaging $p$-values by bootstrap aggregation (Bagging) to account for model uncertainty and selection procedures. The combination of these two key ideas yields bagged empirical null $p$-values (BEN $p$-values) that often dramatically alter the rank ordering of significant findings. Moreover, we find that a multidimensional selection criteria based on BEN $p$-values and bagged model fit statistics is more likely to yield reproducible findings. A re-analysis of the famous Golub Leukemia data is presented to illustrate these ideas. We uncovered new findings in these data, not detected previously, that are backed by published bench work pre-dating the Gloub experiment. A pseudo-simulation using the leukemia data is also presented to explore the stability of this approach under broader conditions, and illustrates the superiority of the BEN $p$-values compared to the other approaches.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sarah F Mercaldo"", ids = ""28322245""); list(name = ""Jeffrey D Blume"", ids = ""2521353"")",,e9d7419cb00874902f9cc3804633b5df8a60d729; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 532e1a5bf22ac3a21685c5eed050c18b53abe2d4; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; fc54360e7f7e9736ff647a08d0decbbe6d3f6ceb; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; 3e9506ae61cd06b3412b0b3dcb0f49ec07dd05e2; 7e0f2d3f9fa6debd90be039c4854bc847640d41b; 426f426da9126213a0115e591a8faf8db8bb0c97; e0685d3be0d3af9dba4763d85231b1e039cae4c3; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; a5efa41e2802aa7fb53e50b9d7aa88923be40c15; 030be455d2f27f73134cc7d61bea9746a38e1c6c,arXiv: Methodology,,
8f321bbbb5a0a513a5a30168a3be59ac27932214,Nutritional Proteomics: Investigating molecular mechanisms underlying the health beneficial effect of functional foods,"Objective : We introduce a new technical and conceptual term â€œnutritional proteomicsâ€ by identifying and quantifying the proteins and their changes in a certain organ or tissue dependent on the food intake by utilizing a mass spectrometry-based proteomics technique. Purpose : Food intake is essentially important for every life on earth to sustain the physical as well as mental functions. The outcome of food intake will be manifested in the health state and its dysfunction. The molecular information about the protein expression change caused by diets will assist us to understand the significance of functional foods. We wish to develop nutritional proteomics to promote a new area in functional food studies for a better understanding of the role of functional foods in health and disease. Methods : We chose two classes of food ingredients to show the feasibility of nutritional proteomics, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids both of which are involved in the inflammation/anti-inflammation axis. Each class of the polyunsaturated fatty acids was mixed in mouse chow respectively. The liver tissue of mice fed with omega-3 diet or omega-3 diet was analyzed by the state-of-the-art shotgun proteomics using nano-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The data were analyzed by the number of differentially expressed proteins that were guaranteed by 1% false discovery rate for protein identification and by the statistical significance of variance evaluated by p-value in two-tailed distribution analysis better than 0.05 (n=4). The differential pattern of protein expression was characterized with Gene Ontology designation. Results : The data analysis of the shotgun nutritional proteomics identified 2,810 proteins that areÂ validated with 1% FDR. Among these 2,810 proteins, 125 were characterized with statisticalÂ significance of varianceÂ (p<0.05; n=4)between the omega-3 diet and the omega-6Â diet by two-tailed distribution analysis. The results illustrate that the dietary influence of omega-3 and omega-6 on protein expression is eminent with the proteins directly responsible for catalytic activity in the â€œMolecular Functionâ€ category, totaling 192 proteins, of Gene OntologyÂ designation. In a similar analysis with regard to the â€œCellular Localizationâ€ category, protein expression changed the most in the sub-categories of â€œCytoplasmâ€, â€œMembraneâ€, â€œNucleusâ€, and â€œMitochondrionâ€, totaling 221 proteins. The same analysis with regard to â€œBiological Processâ€Â considering the top four categories, i.e., â€œMetabolic processâ€, â€œRegulation of biological (process)â€, â€œResponse to stimulusâ€, and â€œTransportâ€ also indicated significant alteration of 182 proteins. These results illustrate a robust influence of dietary elements, omega-3 or omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, on the protein expression in mouse liver. Conclusions : Application of nutritional proteomics to the dietary effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids compared to that of omega-6 on mouse liver revealed; 1) significant number of proteins are altered between the two diets dependent on the classes of polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 or omega-6, in the diet. The change of protein expression is likely to carry the molecular information that we could possibly decipher, leading to a better understanding ofÂ the role of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in inflammatory/anti-inflammatory process. The results corroborate the concept and utility of nutritional proteomics that should be developed as a part of functional food studies with regard to other dietary types.

Our objective was to evaluate the usefulness of mixed-model QTL mapping in the context of a breeding program for a self-pollinated crop. Specifically, we simulated a soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) breeding program and applied a mixed-model approach that comprised three steps: variance component estimation, single-marker analyses, and multiple-marker analysis. Average power to detect QTL ranged from <1 to 47% depending on the significance level (0.01 or 0.0001), number of QTL (20 or 80), heritability of the trait (0.40 or 0.70), population size (600 or 1,200 inbreds), and number of markers (300 or 600). The corresponding false discovery rate ranged from 2 to 43%. Larger populations, higher heritability, and fewer QTL controlling the trait led to a substantial increase in power and to a reduction in the false discovery rate and bias. A stringent significance level reduced both the power and false discovery rate. There was greater power to detect major QTL than minor QTL. Power was higher and the false discovery rate was lower in hybrid crops than in self-pollinated crops.

First, we summarize general background and some critical issues in genomic data mining. We then describe a novel concept of statistical significance, so-called false discovery rate, the rate of false positives among all positive findings, which has been suggested to control the error rate of numerous false positives in large screening biological data analysis. In the next section two recent statistical testing methods---significance analysis of microarray (SAM) and local pooled error (LPE) tests are introduced. We next introduce statistical modeling in genomic data analysis such as ANOVA and heterogeneous error modeling (HEM) approaches that have been suggested for analyzing microarray data obtained from multiple experimental and/or biological conditions. â„¢ gene expression, Misclassification penalized posterior (MiPP), Significance analysis of microarray (SAM), Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning",2015,Computer Science,"list(name = ""S.

bf3a4f01fe66972701f09ab94888f0f1e3274728,Comparison of transcriptomes of wild-type and isothiazolone-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa by using RNA-seq,"Isothiazolone biocides (such as Kathon) are widely used in a variety of industrial and domestic applications. However, the mechanisms through which bacteria develop resistance to these biocides are not completely clear. A better understanding of these mechanisms can contribute to optimal use of these biocides. In this study, transcription profiles of a Kathon-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa-R) and the wild-type strain were determined using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) with the Illumina HiSeqÂ 2000 platform. RNA-Seq generated 18,657,896 sequence reads aligned to 7093 genes. In all, 1550 differently expressed genes (DEGs, log2 ratioÂ â‰¥1, false discovery rate (FDR)Â â‰¤0.001) were identified, of which 482 were up-regulated and 1068 were down-regulated. Most Kathon-induced genes were involved in metabolic and cellular processes. DEGs significantly enriched nitrogen metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. In addition, Pa-R showed cross-resistance to triclosan and ciprofloxacin and showed repressed pyocyanin production. These results may improve our understanding of the resistance mechanisms of P. aeruginosa against isothiazolones, and provide insight into the development of more efficient isothiazolones.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gang Zhou"", ids = ""145625915""); list(name = ""Qingshan Shi"", ids = ""34571322""); list(name = ""Xiao-mo Huang"", ids = ""6213866""); list(name = ""Xiao-bao Xie"", ids = ""6882698"")",57da08393037b148dcdd33fdfa2ea32cd0e0525a; bbe85e5c2c28c0fe684413c3dbc8e6ef88973a44; bdc1a1f694e9259a74e27abdfc35f400248b5f3e; 14810ddbee01abc15f33ece6bee46e9b78d01dec,90947c64553041bb83ce5fd97e7782a75ce77d25; 66185cfa6aeee71b72eb6fb2f3ec25a230b0e113; a95194fc2c38554fd7233c7b47a5ee3efacf8b63; 3a7b3638d810363b239797dd8763a3ba2321ea03; 8423f0ff9ebf28134e7eccb35d3be4336c3ca11b; 90e960ab38c90bf9be6fd657490890d0e1481d2d; 83f1b8342c26c2d581b05484f9c01cf4e6cf3339; 1cc6f6a932e990372acd6e2494db513e23f4e5da; 4362c4a6da6f70acb00fc7e56fffa573cadd8463; 7d44f22240e6024be74cf2b63d27a513b94a91e9; 60a56bbddec75a9ab91864b9054abb550709a221; 5da60059c776b5f236da410ab7427aa96d2f4f80; f68c456e769f2a00ddf19d153534e8c2177c02a0; e875387be9e484bd373ce427797f150f1220bbb0; d15bb3311edf4b1294740f5919c34257f367726d; 8ca27b2cb13ead2b6989f39e1208f0433c366019; 4dae7661e5501a0b783cac8cec115755e1bdc8b9; bd811e1a23d834da15bf0e9efbaa8267f3daddd6; d6bf75ed6a0d3e072f51ec422dfc24fd6b8c09ed; 453a610edaefa80b507ec034659ef91154b31147; 1221de833f4909b7bc27790fa0cd080d756d8982; 475ae8ccd0a899dc055e3815b78768bb71e43a73; a2f30c42940b61cf02b2ee758ecaa2da3a4685c1; 6952b47a81bb30ae45fef99bc3e4df263965bc54; 43b5c4487dea05c07d89ca16c211da16231804e5; 16d4ba9cc1d46d452a40ba7faae870a1c4a36cc0; a968cf26879f25598679a4e15493470041d03abd; c83e5a14ce81b36e505d62f39c4f9fbf18ff23f4; 0e5c8b44d01281b54764650f9dc4af5499a5fbf8; b4c060c75390e6aa7f8fe8b132666664a34b76eb; c43c8212b24c3286534eb6004ff59ea512364944; 7185360d5082094f65bec13af564a4eba0ab9466; 0d28f6e79581f7b0c28e05eb3d3ad428cc95204d; 75c92ecbe71bb37a5fd8b8551cf91ac885c5ad2f; 6e7208b6e4cf7b827765dd011967cd848176ea1b; 9c016ed636eb0d76aed9d4c47ebfb8e6e322e21d; c4e5603d33e2297800f4e341d537a6de3b0a10bc; aa8f7a28faaf31c768da4c85f870f69de81bcfd7; 0e9d009ed9afcb8c12ae8a3972bb05aa84c63690; 903af7ccd2ae53a553cd3a42232e0d6372acf927; a89cb834300b68162d77c6f00eb18f40d13d3846; ec9673f708f84f39f56da11cf234f33a61154dc8; a26cdf8c569cc87e0b648a06edaec5e7784f5d1b; e240bf360d02f2c9ef9221fe53f4704760024b21; d5ed576effa823c176c54c935cdb97496095c32a; d58c846bfe3a8591651e5710713011b691fd1d97; 806da15e02123d16b32db94d4bc2a269b9cb610b; dd60c7a0d587d65b47f59e9a685ef6142ed60b9d; bc5d61573117f5c1ec8511974e04699bc0c5e406; 4dc83c5fdf1a2544a1f34a2eb401220d725af4fe; b9d3eafce3c96c4951445b53547b8341364ff03a; a0436fc2001f681e465c87b478f35798fe56c4fe; 1a7d94c4f48ed74f24ba68e388551630e885f158; 3040ac52b3154de53a831715f2ce7f4e7d3d723b; 7713c3690530ddf61e0d9ae6f063ace53df48116; 50b562374cc32597a46cce8df1c8d284dcd40111; e8d2c73bec0c50344c09a8891abb21292bef6b0f; b3f5305af1ea467c4e366021980cd1d4e7a6ae8a; cee7d11ee35bb55a2b240463df61c6dac1a24628; 86d2c0393c7a96c2bddf3380a9d0e1dd01676ed1; 840e104aff49de0d8b427579593a9ca2482d43ef; 986c1b3707f32e71a8d1a252fab2e6a07cae0cf4; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c,Molecular Biology Reports,43,527-540

Considering the different characters of signal and white noise in the wavelet domain, a novel algorithm to determine the adaptive wavelet threshold is proposed with the use of False Discovery Rate (FDR) step-up-down procedure. Since the wavelet de-noising transform process can be regarded as a multiple hypothesis process and both the step-up and step-down procedures can control the FDR independently, the new method FDR step-up-down procedure combining the above-mentioned procedures determines the wavelet threshold. An attractive advantage of this method is it can obtain the desired result by adjusting the FDR level flexibly. Numerical results show that this procedure works as effective as Hearsure procedure and gives better Signal Noise Ratio (SNR) gains and Mean Square Error (MSE) performance than both the traditional BH FDR and Sqtwolog procedure. In addition, this proposed algorithm has a substantially better power and higher resolution speed.",2010,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Wenliao Du"", ids = ""2691088""); list(name = ""Yanming Li"", ids = ""50025666""); list(name = ""Jin Yuan"", ids = ""144773951""); list(name = ""Chengliang Liu"", ids = ""1699591"")",,12e5939a80ec59f81214d7e729c577c350af9501; 2544949c65e5bf3898df558375b72cda49d83ccc; f69dcc4d0452eeb03f0a0361238334a9110b527f; b2366d057204c401615b8cdead5cf47ef4b9dbc3; ea46d5e259e75d4822789b02689b8df70ef9329f; 4f6e229797d883770a62f97622354ce30031714f; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; c5d8dd126d8a22f1a8b24c23dc04d75e6caebd71; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 35298626a71b2d205b80e8e6fc1ab14a305c7af4; adcfa3752be34149ddd5599078306768c1ca7cea; 3eeb4ebf8df49c48c779ebbdc7878290f21e56ca; 2cc257b0c7db92f90c3224c35df7b8e85f57a090,2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation,,1316-1321

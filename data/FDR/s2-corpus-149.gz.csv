ae66c9375443ff7b360402ebe1c62241a9d3a1b8,A rate optimal procedure for recovering sparse differences between high-dimensional means under dependence,"The paper considers the problem of recovering the sparse different components between two high dimensional means of columnwise dependent random vectors. We show that the dependence can be utilized to lower the identification boundary for signal recovery. Moreover, an optimal convergence rate for the marginal false non-discovery rate (mFNR) is established under the dependence. The convergence rate is faster than the optimal rate without dependence. To recover the sparse signal bearing dimensions, we propose a Dependence-Assisted Thresholding and Excising (DATE) procedure, which is shown to be rate optimal for the mFNR with the marginal false discovery rate (mFDR) controlled at a pre-specified level. Extensions of the DATE to recover the differences in contrasts among multiple population means and differences between two covariance matrices are also provided. Simulation studies and case study are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed signal identification procedure.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jun Li"", ids = ""37397865""); list(name = ""Ping Zhong"", ids = ""143741626"")",ae66c9375443ff7b360402ebe1c62241a9d3a1b8; 57f7a69496380752392b95d42070b296424c22a7; 11148708083528841698faf3904bf02f6ba6ad3f; f894480feb384ec064962637bbcba1a3b45716ab; 22e08d869f243bcc108c695a9bd53f1fed04fb39,a759777f7c4d59bd43f870d98f618ac09ad66fa3; 88c16d834b68de0fef473b9481c76dbb8850ed5e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 133e1c15ecf6bf3374d58bef2fc3a425d76eb03c; 05ab43b91321e8cf57a42614dd630baecd110bd0; 47cebef32950bab06faf735bbfa4740245d5bfb0; 89c444b2702b101f178d6ea36138c655be2f1fff; 15ab26345d3c7accfa36c04d448e641628bfabbf; cb3efcd5de509f156420976977187a6311d12b6c; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; d06798476ae907160dc4ec6b88be466fdcdb8b6d; eb211d1441615c7f7176c3f57f11ca35316c4810; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; d06b7e6be29669329b331a538bdcaf0fdd0a55f2; ae66c9375443ff7b360402ebe1c62241a9d3a1b8; 0f37000b63f0e4de4f6d31dd288a60e8d4f62c06; 2a4a3c9b6aac9733e11c8860a5be1f2d32a617bd; a8ce97017c6dc7d187aef5da4c934ed5c259480b; 30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98; 2888f87e01c7adfd95f02c52339a7db8ad329677; 59ee093343177e81ae17ac01f33724c6154a0619; e2a187c6ec22b531a438bfa65b679b9a1a87597d; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc; b4ee596014935f02d5496146774d2b6caae92ba9; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; d65edfe2fb8127587cc0051cd20f220e3a2f2554; 8d4a82f8262abfb55754990665146f8bca94d8d6,Annals of Statistics,45,557-590
e7bc312a56789a01441319972b77876ea7c9c7ca,A Novel Approach to Detecting Epistasis using Random Sampling Regularisation.,"Epistasis is a progressive approach that complements the 'common disease, common variant' hypothesis that highlights the potential for connected networks of genetic variants collaborating to produce a phenotypic expression. Epistasis is commonly performed as a pairwise or limitless-arity capacity that considers variant networks as either variant vs variant or as high order interactions. This type of analysis extends the number of tests that were previously performed in a standard approach such as Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), in which False Discovery Rate (FDR) is already an issue, therefore by multiplying the number of tests up to a factorial rate also increases the issue of FDR. Further to this, epistasis introduces its own limitations of computational complexity and intensity that are generated based on the analysis performed; to consider the most intense approach, a multivariate analysis introduces a time complexity of O(n!). Proposed in this paper is a novel methodology for the detection of epistasis using interpretable methods and best practice to outline interactions through filtering processes.

557e84ee895c5719dcc78328198d00f3f1bac103,Comparison of desmoplastic tumor stroma and normal stroma in breast cancer by MALDI-MS and histology directed protein profiling,"3948 Background: Complex interactions among proteins in both tumor epithelium and its surrounding stroma are likely involved in promoting breast cancer development and progression. The progressive alteration of mammary epithelium during neoplastic transformation is accompanied by peritumoral fibroblast proliferation and compositional changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) collectively referred to as desmoplastic tumor stroma (DTS). This stroma is histologically and biochemically different from normal stroma; however, its role in facilitating malignant growth is incompletely characterized. This study compared mass spectrometry profiles of normal breast stroma and DTS to identify proteins dysregulated in the tumor microenvironment during neoplastic progression.â€¨ Methods: Human breast tumor specimens were obtained from 17 patients. Cases were selected which contained both areas of DTS and normal breast stroma in the frozen tissue samples. Two serial 12 Âµm sections were cut from each sample. One section was mounted onto a histology slide and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and the adjacent section was thaw-mounted directly onto a gold-coated MALDI target plate. The H&E staining allowed the histological characterization and was a guide for the histology directed acoustic robotic matrix deposition on the tissue sections. Individual matrix spots of 200 Âµm in diameter were deposited on the DTS in the immediate vicinity of tumor areas and also on the normal stroma surrounding normal lobular units. Profile spectra were acquired from the marked areas across the sections by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Statistical comparisons by Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) using a minimum 2 fold-change and false discovery rate 2-fold) in the desmoplastic tumor stroma and one protein showed greater expression in the normal stroma.â€¨ Discussion: Recent findings underscore that the stromal-epithelial interface is a critical mediator of oncogenic potential and suggest that the effectiveness of breast cancer therapies directed against ER, EGFR or microvessels might ultimately depend on the properties of the surrounding DTS. The identification of intermediary proteins in these signaling pathways and other undiscovered pathways by the comparative study of protein expression in normal stroma and DTS may ultimately lead to the manipulation of these pathways for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.

54d54cab449781922e098242d38bb688681aba10,Aerobic exercise augments muscle transcriptome profile of resistance exercise.,"Recent reports suggest that aerobic exercise may boost the hypertrophic response to short-term resistance training. This study explored the effects of an acute aerobic exercise bout on the transcriptional response to subsequent resistance exercise. Ten moderately trained men performed âˆ¼45 min cycling on one leg followed by 4 Ã— 7 maximal knee extensions for each leg, 15 min later. Thus, one limb performed aerobic and resistance exercise (AE + RE) while the opposing leg did resistance exercise only (RE). Biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of each leg 3 h after the resistance exercise bout. Using DNA microarray, we analyzed differences [â‰¥1.5-fold, false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤10%] in gene expression profiles for the two modes of exercise. There were 176 genes up (127)- or downregulated (49) by AE + RE compared with RE. Among the most significant differentially expressed genes were established markers for muscle growth and oxidative capacity, novel cytokines, transcription factors, and micro-RNAs (miRNAs). The most enriched functional categories were those linked to carbohydrate metabolism and transcriptional regulation. Upstream analysis revealed that vascular endothelial growth factor, cAMP-response element-binding protein, Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase, and mammalian target of rapamycin were regulators highly activated by AE + RE, whereas JnK, NF-ÎºÎ², MAPK, and several miRNAs were inhibited. Thus, aerobic exercise alters the skeletal muscle transcriptional signature of resistance exercise to initiate important gene programs promoting both myofiber growth and improved oxidative capacity. These results provide novel insight into human muscle adaptations to diverse exercise modes and offer the very first genomic basis explaining how aerobic exercise may augment, rather than compromise, muscle growth induced by resistance exercise.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tommy R Lundberg"", ids = ""48688087""); list(name = ""R Fernandez-Gonzalo"", ids = ""1398913585""); list(name = ""Per A.

f7454ef88b8a5b418a501aa4cf0cbe7161a3317c,Exact statistical tests for the intersection of independent lists of genes.,"Public data repositories have enabled researchers to compare results across multiple genomic studies in order to replicate findings. A common approach is to first rank genes according to an hypothesis of interest within each study. Then, lists of the top-ranked genes within each study are compared across studies. Genes recaptured as highly ranked (usually above some threshold) in multiple studies are considered to be significant. However, this comparison strategy often remains informal, in that Type I error and false discovery rate are usually uncontrolled. In this paper, we formalize an inferential strategy for this kind of list-intersection discovery test. We show how to compute a p-value associated with a `recaptured' set of genes, using a closed-form Poisson approximation to the distribution of the size of the recaptured set. The distribution of the test statistic depends on the rank threshold and the number of studies within which a gene must be recaptured. We use a Poisson approximation to investigate operating characteristics of the test. We give practical guidance on how to design a bioinformatic list-intersection study with prespecified control of Type I error (at the set level) and false discovery rate (at the gene level). We show how choice of test parameters will affect the expected proportion of significant genes identified. We present a strategy for identifying optimal choice of parameters, depending on the particular alternative hypothesis which might hold.

3ca861cf571dc113f2dd0475ed1353bb98851a54,Global Methylation Patterns in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,"BACKGROUND
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by profound changes in the lung phenotype including excessive extracellular matrix deposition, myofibroblast foci, alveolar epithelial cell hyperplasia and extensive remodeling. The role of epigenetic changes in determining the lung phenotype in IPF is unknown. In this study we determine whether IPF lungs exhibit an altered global methylation profile.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Immunoprecipitated methylated DNA from 12 IPF lungs, 10 lung adenocarcinomas and 10 normal histology lungs was hybridized to Agilent human CpG Islands Microarrays and data analysis was performed using BRB-Array Tools and DAVID Bioinformatics Resources software packages. Array results were validated using the EpiTYPER MassARRAY platform for 3 CpG islands. 625 CpG islands were differentially methylated between IPF and control lungs with an estimated False Discovery Rate less than 5%. The genes associated with the differentially methylated CpG islands are involved in regulation of apoptosis, morphogenesis and cellular biosynthetic processes. The expression of three genes (STK17B, STK3 and HIST1H2AH) with hypomethylated promoters was increased in IPF lungs. Comparison of IPF methylation patterns to lung cancer or control samples, revealed that IPF lungs display an intermediate methylation profile, partly similar to lung cancer and partly similar to control with 402 differentially methylated CpG islands overlapping between IPF and cancer. Despite their similarity to cancer, IPF lungs did not exhibit hypomethylation of long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) retrotransposon while lung cancer samples did, suggesting that the global hypomethylation observed in cancer was not typical of IPF.


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
Our results provide evidence that epigenetic changes in IPF are widespread and potentially important. The partial similarity to cancer may signify similar pathogenetic mechanisms while the differences constitute IPF or cancer specific changes. Elucidating the role of these specific changes will potentially allow better understanding of the pathogenesis of IPF.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Einat I.

7458f2a8fd6fe015057aa72d55c03b8e7d6657ea,iGWAS: Integrative Genome-Wide Association Studies of Genetic and Genomic Data for Disease Susceptibility Using Mediation Analysis.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been a standard practice in identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for disease susceptibility. We propose a new approach, termed integrative GWAS (iGWAS) that exploits the information of gene expressions to investigate the mechanisms of the association of SNPs with a disease phenotype, and to incorporate the family-based design for genetic association studies. Specifically, the relations among SNPs, gene expression, and disease are modeled within the mediation analysis framework, which allows us to disentangle the genetic effect on a disease phenotype into two parts: an effect mediated through a gene expression (mediation effect, ME) and an effect through other biological mechanisms or environment-mediated mechanisms (alternative effect, AE). We develop omnibus tests for the ME and AE that are robust to underlying true disease models. Numerical studies show that the iGWAS approach is able to facilitate discovering genetic association mechanisms, and outperforms the SNP-only method for testing genetic associations. We conduct a family-based iGWAS of childhood asthma that integrates genetic and genomic data. The iGWAS approach identifies six novel susceptibility genes (MANEA, MRPL53, LYCAT, ST8SIA4, NDFIP1, and PTCH1) using the omnibus test with false discovery rate less than 1%, whereas no gene using SNP-only analyses survives with the same cut-off.

b6a931f9edc4489e467dd279c37e50e0626548df,Ensemble genomic analysis in human lung tissue identifies novel genes for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"BackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, many genetic variants show suggestive evidence for association but do not meet the strict threshold for genome-wide significance. Integrative analysis of multiple omics datasets has the potential to identify novel genes involved in disease pathogenesis by leveraging these variants in a functional, regulatory context.ResultsWe performed expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis using genome-wide SNP genotyping and gene expression profiling of lung tissue samples from 86 COPD cases and 31 controls, testing for SNPs associated with gene expression levels. These results were integrated with a prior COPD GWAS using an ensemble statistical and network methods approach to identify relevant genes and observe them in the context of overall genetic control of gene expression to highlight co-regulated genes and disease pathways. We identified 250,312 unique SNPs and 4997 genes in the cis(local)-eQTL analysis (5% false discovery rate). The top gene from the integrative analysis was MAPT, a gene recently identified in an independent GWAS of lung function. The genes HNRNPAB and PCBP2 with RNA binding activity and the gene ACVR1B were identified in network communities with validated disease relevance.ConclusionsThe integration of lung tissue gene expression with genome-wide SNP genotyping and subsequent intersection with prior GWAS and omics studies highlighted candidate genes within COPD loci and in communities harboring known COPD genes. ThisÂ integration also identified novel disease genes in sub-threshold regions that would otherwise have been missed through GWAS.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jarrett D Morrow"", ids = ""39287671""); list(name = ""Michael H.

5e8ca51b35dd1cdf1b7eb7f39b56ecb50e522c7a,Gene expression profiling in blood from cerebral malaria patients and mild malaria patients living in Senegal,"BackgroundPlasmodium falciparum malaria remains a major health problem in Africa. The mechanisms of pathogenesis are not fully understood. Transcriptomic studies may provide new insights into molecular pathways involved in the severe form of the disease.MethodsBlood transcriptional levels were assessed in patients with cerebral malaria, non-cerebral malaria, or mild malaria by using microarray technology to look for gene expression profiles associated with clinical status. Multi-way ANOVA was used to extract differentially expressed genes. Network and pathways analyses were used to detect enrichment for biological pathways.ResultsWe identified a set of 443 genes that were differentially expressed in the three patient groups after applying a false discovery rate of 10%. Since the cerebral patients displayed a particular transcriptional pattern, we focused our analysis on the differences between cerebral malaria patients and mild malaria patients. We further found 842 differentially expressed genes after applying a false discovery rate of 10%. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of cerebral malaria-informative genes led to clustering of the cerebral malaria patients. The support vector machine method allowed us to correctly classify five out of six cerebral malaria patients and six of six mild malaria patients. Furthermore, the products of the differentially expressed genes were mapped onto a human protein-protein network. This led to the identification of the proteins with the highest number of interactions, including GSK3B, RELA, and APP. The enrichment analysis of the gene functional annotation indicates that genes involved in immune signalling pathways play a role in the occurrence of cerebral malaria. These include BCR-, TCR-, TLR-, cytokine-, FcÎµRI-, and FCGR- signalling pathways and natural killer cell cytotoxicity pathways, which are involved in the activation of immune cells. In addition, our results revealed an enrichment of genes involved in Alzheimerâ€™s disease.ConclusionsIn the present study, we examine a set of genes whose expression differed in cerebral malaria patients and mild malaria patients. Moreover, our results provide new insights into the potential effect of the dysregulation of gene expression in immune pathways. Host genetic variation may partly explain such alteration of gene expression.

To assess 1.9â€‰GHz radiofrequency (RF) field exposure on gene expression within a variety of discrete mouse brain regions using whole genome microarray analysis.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Adult male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 1.9â€‰GHz pulse-modulated or continuous-wave RF fields for 4â€‰h/day for 5 consecutive days at whole body average (WBA) specific absorption rates of 0 (sham), âˆ¼0.2 W/kg and âˆ¼1.4 W/kg. Total RNA was isolated from the auditory cortex, amygdala, caudate, cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and medial prefrontal cortex and differential gene expression was assessed using Illumina MouseWG-6 (v2) BeadChip arrays. Validation of potentially responding genes was conducted by RT-PCR.


RESULTS
When analysis of gene expression was conducted within individual brain regions when controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), no differentially expressed genes were identified relative to the sham control. However, it must be noted that most fold changes among groups were observed to be less than 1.5-fold and this study had limited ability to detect such small changes. While some genes were differentially expressed without correction for multiple-comparisons testing, no consistent pattern of response was observed among different RF-exposure levels or among different RF-modulations.


CONCLUSIONS
The current study provides the most comprehensive analysis of potential gene expression changes in the rodent brain in response to RF field exposure conducted to date. Within the exposure conditions and limitations of this study, no convincing evidence of consistent changes in gene expression was found in response to 1.9â€‰GHz RF field exposure.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""J.

Using simulation studies based on actual Houses, as well as the roll call record of the U.S. House since its creation, we show that existing measures of gatekeeping power are upwardly biased { suggesting that there are more votes consistent with gatekeeping than we have good reason to suspect. The magnitude of this bias is shown to systematically vary with the width of gridlock intervals. Investigating how the corrected measures change over time renes our understanding of the extent to which the majority party may exercise gatekeeping.

However, the appropriate analytical methods and experimental design that maximize the efficiency of these methods while maintaining statistical power are currently unknown. Here, we have used Bar-seq analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast deletion library to systematically test the effect of experimental design parameters and sequence read depth on experimental results. We present computational methods that efficiently and accurately estimate effect sizes and their statistical significance by adapting existing methods for RNA-seq analysis. Using simulated variation of experimental designs, we found that biological replicates are critical for statistical analysis of Bar-seq data, whereas technical replicates are of less value. By subsampling sequence reads, we found that when using four-fold biological replication, 6 million reads per condition achieved 96% power to detect a two-fold change (or more) at a 5% false discovery rate. Our guidelines for experimental design and computational analysis enables the study of the yeast deletion collection in up to 30 different conditions in a single sequencing lane.

aef517069bde240abffad073cce4e7d46a2cee02,FDR-controlling testing procedures and sample size determination for microarrays.,"Microarrays are used increasingly to identify genes that are truly differentially expressed in tissues under different conditions. Planning such studies requires establishing a sample size that will ensure adequate statistical power. For microarray analyses, false discovery rate (FDR) is considered to be an appropriate error measure. Several FDR-controlling procedures have been developed. How these procedures perform for such analyses has not been evaluated thoroughly under realistic assumptions. In order to develop a method of determining sample sizes for these procedures, it needs to be established whether these procedures really control the FDR below the pre-specified level so that the determined sample size indeed provides adequate power. To answer this question, we first conducted simulation studies. Our simulation results showed that these procedures do control the FDR at most situations but under-control the FDR when the proportion of positive genes is small, the most likely scenarios. Thus, these existing procedures can overestimate the power and underestimate the sample size. Accordingly, we developed a simulation-based method to provide more accurate estimates for power and sample size.",2005,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shuying Sue Li"", ids = ""40081591""); list(name = ""Jeannette Bigler"", ids = ""145537928""); list(name = ""Johanna W Lampe"", ids = ""2329342""); list(name = ""John D.

a802aa9a6360ff5008ed691a3386203fe265b9e9,A data-driven approach for studying the role of body mass in multiple diseases: a phenome-wide registry-based case-control study in the UK Biobank,"Summary Background Mendelian randomisation allows for the testing of causal effects in situations where clinical trials are challenging to do. In this hypothesis-free, data-driven phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), we sought to assess possible associations of high body-mass index (BMI) with multiple disease outcomes. Methods For this registry-based case-control PheWAS, we used genome-wide data available from the UK Biobank to construct a genetic risk score of 76 variants related to BMI. Eligible UK Biobank participants were aged 37â€“73 years during recruitment, were white British, were unrelated to each other, and had available genetic information. Disease outcomes from these participants were mapped to a phenotype code (phecode). Participants with a phecode of interest were recoded as cases, whereas participants without a phecode of interest or any codes under a parent phecode were classified as controls. We did a PheWAS to analyse possible associations between the BMI genetic risk score and a range of disease outcomes. Disease associations passing stringent correction for multiple testing (Bonferroni corrected threshold p Findings Our study population comprised 337â€ˆ536 UK Biobank participants, and analyses were done for 925 unique phecodes from 17 different disease categories. After Bonferroni correction, PheWAS identified that BMI genetic risk score was associated with hospital-diagnosed obesity and 58 other outcomes; 30 distinct disease associations were supported by the mendelian randomisation analyses. 30 distinct disease associations were supported by the mendelian randomisation analyses. In inverse-variance weighted mendelian randomisation, genetically determined BMI was associated with endocrine disorders (odds ratio per one SD or 4Â·1 kg/m2 higher BMI 2Â·72, 95% CI 2Â·33â€“3Â·29 for type 2 diabetes; 2Â·11, 1Â·62â€“2Â·76 for type 1 diabetes; and 1Â·46, 1Â·25â€“1Â·70 for hypothyroidism), circulatory diseases (1Â·96, 1Â·53â€“2Â·51 for phlebitis and thrombophlebitis; 1Â·89, 1Â·39â€“2Â·57 for cardiomegaly; 1Â·68, 1Â·35â€“2Â·09 for congestive heart failure; 1Â·55, 1Â·37â€“1Â·76 for hypertension; 1Â·31, 1Â·13â€“1Â·52 for ischaemic heart disease; and 1Â·25, 1Â·14â€“1Â·37 for cardiac dysrhythmias), and inflammatory or dermatological conditions (2Â·00, 1Â·72â€“2Â·23 for superficial cellulitis and abscess; 3Â·37, 2Â·17â€“5Â·25 for chronic ulcers of leg and foot; 4Â·99, 2Â·54â€“9Â·82 for gangrene; and 2Â·24, 1Â·53â€“3Â·28 for atopy). Mendelian randomisation analyses provided further support for a causal effect of BMI on renal failure, osteoarthrosis, neurological (insomnia and peripheral nerve disorders) and respiratory diseases (asthma and chronic bronchitis), structural problems (hernias and knee derangement), and chemotherapy treatment. Mendelian randomisation with Egger regression produced consistently wider CIs compared with those of other methods. 26 of 72 distinct diseases detected under false discovery rate correction produced consistent estimates across at least four mendelian randomisation methods, and consistent evidence across all five approaches was obtained for 14 diseases. Interpretation Our data-driven approach identified a range of diseases as possibly affected by high BMI. This population-level screening approximated the accumulated consequences of high BMI, whereas the true effects might be more complex and vary by life stage. Our results highlight the importance of obesity prevention and effective management of obesity-related comorbidities.

d34daf93116c4adbf17f86d8d61cc4e49ac20f3d,Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes in Mice with Nutritional or Genetic Causes of Iron Overload,"Iron overload causes the generation of reactive oxygen species, which can lead to lasting organ damage, particularly to the liver. In patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, transfusion-dependent anemias, and hemoglobinopathies, iron overload is a major cause of mortality. A deeper understanding of iron regulation and the biological pathways involved in maintaining homeostasis may reveal new therapeutic targets for patients with iron overload disorders. We designed this study to discover genes that are differentially expressed in nutritional and genetic models of iron overload. For the nutritional iron overload study, 5-week old male C57BL/6 mice were placed on a soy-free diet (AIN-93G) containing different amounts of iron per kilogram of food: iron-deficient (2.5 mg/kg, n=3), iron-sufficient (37.5 mg/kg, n=3), and iron-excess (750 mg/kg, n=3). In the second study, 5-week old male C57BL/6 mice that were either wild type or HJV knockout mice that exhibited severe early onset iron overload secondary to homozygous deficiency of the bone morphogenic protein coreceptor, hemojuvelin ( HJV ), were maintained on the iron-deficient (2.5 mg/kg iron) diet (n=2 per group). For both studies animals were sacrificed after 50 days and liver RNA was extracted and sequenced at 40-50 million reads per sample. The RNA integrity number (RIN) for each sample was >6 and assessments of read duplication, base call frequency, and read quality indicated excellent quality of the data. For the HJV knockout mice, we used a false discovery rate 2, to reveal genes that were differentially expressed compared to wild type mice. For the dietary iron study, genes were grouped by self-organizing maps to identify transcripts whose level of expression trended with increased or decreased dietary iron intake. The resulting analysis identified 148 genes in nutritionally iron-overloaded mice and 688 genes in HJV knockout mice that exhibited significant changes in expression. Of these, 28 genes were differentially regulated in both nutritionally iron overloaded and HJV knockout mice, including expected genes, such as transferrin receptor , HAMP ( hepcidin ), and bone morphogenic protein 6 , and unexpected genes such as cytochrome P450 17a1 ( cyp17a1 ), an enzyme that catalyzes critical steps in steroid synthesis, and nicotinomide N-methyltransferase ( nnmt ), an enzyme that regulates drug metabolism and DNA methylation. We clustered the 688 differentially expressed genes from the HJV knockout mice into functional pathways using the Functional Analysis tool from DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 (NIAID). Clusters were considered significant if there were >2 genes in the pathway and the Benjamini-Hochberg P-value was HJV knockout mice compared to wild-type mice. Our RNA sequencing analysis identified a variety of novel pathways that were differentially regulated in dietary and genetic models of iron overload. Further studies are underway to characterize the potential roles of these genes in iron homeostasis.

The aim of this study was to obtain a CNV genome map using the Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip data of 651 bulls of the Italian Brown Swiss breed. PennCNV and SVS7 (Golden Helix) software were used for the detection of the CNVs and Copy Number Variation Regions (CNVRs). A total of 5,099 and 1,289 CNVs were identified with PennCNV and SVS7 software, respectively. These were grouped at the population level into 1101 (220 losses, 774 gains, 107 complex) and 277 (185 losses, 56 gains and 36 complex) CNVR. Ten of the selected CNVR were experimentally validated with a qPCR experiment. The GO and pathway analyses were conducted and they identified genes (false discovery rate corrected) in the CNVR related to biological processes cellular component, molecular function and metabolic pathways. Among those, we found the FCGR2B , PPARÎ± , KATNAL1 , DNAJC15 , PTK2 , TG , STAT family , NPM1 , GATA2 , LMF1 , ECHS1 genes, already known in literature because of their association with various traits in cattle. Although there is variability in the CNVRs detection across methods and platforms, this study allowed the identification of CNVRs in Italian Brown Swiss, overlapping those already detected in other breeds and finding additional ones, thus producing new knowledge for association studies with traits of interest in cattle.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Alessandro Bagnato"", ids = ""1878307""); list(name = ""Maria Giuseppina Strillacci"", ids = ""3857502""); list(name = ""Laura Pellegrino"", ids = ""145570962""); list(name = ""Fausta Schiavini"", ids = ""4732716""); list(name = ""Erika Frigo"", ids = ""3033535""); list(name = ""Attilio Rossoni"", ids = ""6195374""); list(name = ""Luca Fontanesi"", ids = ""2568019""); list(name = ""Christian Maltecca"", ids = ""6089360""); list(name = ""R.T.M.M.

0cc903e7dab086f86822390890d9da32fe9eaddd,Abstract 1561: Gene expression analysis identifies heterogeneity in cutaneous melanoma subjects with disruptiveMC1Ralleles andBRAFhotspot mutations,"Background: Previous epidemiological and population sequencing studies have established that subjects with melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) germline mutations, associated with red hair and light skin phenotypes, have an increased risk of melanoma. However, several conflicting reports about the role of BRAF somatic mutations in MC1R subjects exist in the literature. We hypothesise that this conflict is due to biological process driven heterogeneity within MC1R subjects carrying disruptive alleles. To understand the heterogeneity, we analysed the TCGA cohort at the gene expression level using mRNA sequencing data. Method: From the previously published studies, we identified 68 cutaneous melanoma subjects who were of white ethinicity, had at least one disruptive allele of MC1R, and had BRAF mutations. Associated clinical and mRNA sequencing data were downloaded from the Firebrowse website. An unbiased hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using the preprocessed mRNA data containing 14669 gene expressions. The resultant clusters were then characterised using available clinical variables. A differential expression analysis was performed to identify the genomic signatures of these clusters. The resultant p-values were corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg approach. Genes with corrected p-values less than 0.01 were further analysed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) preranked lists. Results: An unbiased clustering identified two clear and separable clusters with 40 and 28 subjects respectively. The UV-signature (dipyrimidine C>T load) was correlated with these clusters (p-value = 0.047). However, no significant differences in age at the time of diagnosis, overall survival, and total mutation load between clusters were observed. At the genomic level, 2588 genes were significantly differentially expressed between two clusters (FDR corrected p- value less than 0.05). The top 10 differentially expressed genes included ATF2, MSH6, SP3, MAP3K2, and VEGFB. Further GSEA revealed gene sets playing roles in several pathways and biological processes, including oxidative phosphorylation, UV response in keratinocytes, DNA repair, cell cycle, and cellular response to stress. Conclusion: Cutaneous melanoma subjects with disruptive MC1R alleles and BRAF hotspot mutations have heterogeneous gene expression profiles with several key oncogenes differentially expressed. This suggests potential roles of other pathways, either independently or in cooperation with BRAF mutations, in melanomagenesis in MC1R bearing patients. Citation Format: Piyushkumar A.

Our previous research has shown that the essential sulfur-amino acid methionine inhibited proliferation of breast and prostate cancer cell lines, concomitant with p53 modification. The aim of this study was to increment understanding of the mechanisms underlying these effects by determining the influence of L-methionine on functional molecular signatures in these cell lines. Wild-type p53-expressing MCF-7 (breast cancer) and LNCaP (prostate cancer) cells were treated with L-methionine (5mg/ml) for 72hrs. Changes in molecular signatures of these cells were examined by microarray analysis of 15,814 probes in triplicate samples. Genes with significant expression changes were identified by False Discovery Rate analysis (p-value 1.5). In LNCaP cells, 325 genes were up-regulated by methionine treatment and 517 genes down-regulated. In MCF-7 cells, 86 genes were up-regulated by methionine and 135 genes up-regulated. Ninety eight genes were regulated in the same direction by methionine in both cell lines; 10 of these genes were up-regulated (AFF3, AKR1C2, ATF3, C8ORF4, GPX8, LAMA3, RBM4B, NQO1, SH3BGRL, and VAMP5) and 88 genes were down-regulated. The expression of five other genes (H1F0, TNF, CENPN, ACAT2, and DHRS2) was changed in opposite directions in the two cell lines. Increases in expression were verified by quantitative RT-PCR. Several of the up-regulated genes encode proteins involved in cellular redox regulation and many of the down-regulated genes belonged to protein kinase families. These observations suggest that methionine is an enhancer of antioxidant activities and has potential as an anti-cancer agent that targets breast and prostate cancer cells.

This caseâ€“control study nested within the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) examined the association between inherited genetic variation in the insulin receptor (INSR) gene and obesity-related cancer risk.MethodsThe study sample consisted of 1,475 controls and 396 cases from the second familial generation of the FHS. Participants who provided consent were genotyped. Nineteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the INSR gene were investigated in relation to risk of obesity-related cancers combined and breast, prostate and colorectal cancers. Generalized estimation equation models controlling for familial correlations and include age, sex, smoking and body mass index as covariates, assuming additive models, were used.ResultsThree SNPs, rs2059807, s8109559 and rs919275, were significantly associated with obesity-related cancers (p valueÂ <Â 0.02) with the most significantly associated SNP being rs2059807 (p valueÂ =Â 0.008). Carriers of two copies of SNP rs2059807 risk allele T were significantly less prevalent among subjects with obesity-related cancers [f(TT)casesÂ =Â 14 vs. f(TT)controlsÂ =Â 18Â %; OR 1.23]. In exploratory analyses evaluating site-specific cancers, the INSR rs2059807 association with these cancers was consistent with that observed for the main outcome (ORs colorectal cancerÂ =Â 1.5, breast cancerÂ =Â 1.29, prostateÂ =Â 1.06). There was no statistically significant interaction between the INSRâ€“SNP and blood glucose in relation to obesity-related cancer.ConclusionsThe INSR gene is implicated in obesity-related cancer risk, as 3 of 19 SNPs were nominally associated, after false discovery rate (FDR) correction, with the main outcome. Risk allele homozygotes (rs2059807) were less prevalent among subjects with obesity-related cancer.

83860d7392463b7bf3312dfe392377c9c002e086,"Multi-â€˜omicâ€™ analyses of the dynamics, mechanisms, and pathways for carbon turnover in grassland soil under two climate regimes","In this project, we will investigate how different rainfall impacts the dynamics of carbon stored in grassland soil, and the potential consequences for release of carbon and other nutrients from soils to streams. However, little is known of the microorganisms that play vital roles in the processing of this largely vegetation-derived soil carbon and how the metabolic activities that occur at different soil depths ultimately impact DOC discharged into streams. We are studying the period around the first Fall rainfall event, when soilassociated carbon fixed during Spring growth is rapidly metabolized, focusing on climate manipulations that differ 1) in the amount of Spring rainfall (above-ground carbon stocks) and 2) on the period of time following the first Fall rain events (soil microbial communities) and 3) soil depth. Genomic information was obtained for ten soil samples from two sites at 1020 cm and 3040 cm depth, two of which were collected before the first rainfall and the rest after. Metagenomic data were assembled and draft genomes, including dozens of partial to near complete genomes, were binned and reconstructed based on time series coverage analysis and tetranucleotide frequency using ggKbase and emergent self-organizing maps. While present in most samples, many microbes were more abundant (estimated by coverage) at certain depths. Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia were more abundant in the 1020 cm sample than 3040 cm while the Archaea domain, Methylomirabilis, GAL15, and NC10 were more abundant at 3040 cm than the 1020 cm depth. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the soil is dominated by Archaea and several phyla of Bacteria. Most of the organisms clustered with closely related species, creating a dandelion-like structure at the branchesâ€™ termini. In many cases there were no reference sequences of considerable similarity, representing new phyla and many novel classes and orders within the Gemmatimonadetes, Verrucomicrobia, Deltaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria (most novelty here), and Chloroflexi phyla. Polar metabolites were extracted from selected preand post-rain soil samples using an aqueous extraction method and detected on an Agilent 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF LC/MS system following separation on a zwitterionic stationary phase column. Approximately 140 putative compounds were tracked across soil depth profiles and preliminary analysis of the metabolite composition indicated that carbon and nitrogen sources (simple sugars and quaternary ammonium compounds) clustered with depth, decreasing from 10 cm to 40 cm. Total protein samples were extracted from soils using a modified MoBio NoviPure protocol and cleaned up and digested using the Filter-Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) method. The proteome digest samples were analyzed using 2-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry on a LTQOrbitrap Elite mass spectrometer. The mass spectral data were searched using the Sipros algorithm on the Titan supercomputer against a combined soil metagenome database constructed above. On average approximately two thousand proteins or protein groups were identified per soil sample with a peptide-level false discovery rate at 1% and a protein-level false discovery rate at ~2%. Proteomics analysis revealed that corresponding sugar transporters are present and that there are abundant proteins in all samples are those involved in methanotrophy and ammonification. The results from these â€œomicsâ€ methods are quickly coming together to form a narrative about the dynamic microbial community and its processes below the grass root zone with respect to carbon flow during the Fall rainfall event. We anticipate these below ground terrestrial system feedbacks will impact the grassland ecosystem and the global carbon cycle.

The interactions between adipose tissue and the central nervous system (CNS) are important for the regulation of energy balance. CNS function is also influenced by age. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of body mass index (BMI) and age on cytokine and chemokine levels in cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid samples (n=89) were collected from patients undergoing routine surgical procedures. The samples were analyzed using the multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA) in which 92 different cytokines are measured simultaneously using minute sample volume. We found no significant correlations between age and cytokine levels for any of the studied markers. In contrast, at a false discovery rate of 10%, 19 markers were significantly associated with BMI (in decreasing significance: FGF-5, ADA, Beta-NGF, CD40, IL-10RB, CCL19, TGF-alpha, SIRT2, TWEAK, SCF, CSF-1, 4E-BP1, DNER, LIF-R, STAMPB, CXCL10, CXCL6, VEGF-A and CX3CL1).

8f5602bf6f4bb4be6dfa154515f06857bb438e7d,Analysis of differentially expressed genes and microRNAs in alcoholic liver disease.,"The purpose of this study was to screen differentially expressed genes and             microRNAs in order to find a new target for the accurate diagnosis and effective             therapy of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) at the gene and microRNA levels. The             totalÂ RNA of liver tissues was extracted from four groups of patients, ten subjects             each. Microarrays were utilized to detect differentially expressed genes and microRNAs.             According to gene values, significance levels and false discovery rate with a             random variance model, gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes             and Genomes (KEGG) database, node genes and key microRNAs in networks were obtained             and analyzed. A total of 878 differentially expressed genes and 26Â microRNAs were             found. In co-expression genetic networks, node genes modulating the network were             Acyl-coenzyme AÂ synthetase-3 (ACSF3), Frizzled-5 (FZD5), LOC727987 and C1orf222.             In microRNA-gene networks, the key microRNAs were hsa-miR-570, hsa-miR-122, hsa-miR-34b,             hsa-miR-29c, hsa-miR-922 and hsa-miR-185, which negatively regulated approximately             79 downstream target genes. In the course of ALD, we found 4 differentially expressed             node genes and analyzed ACSF3 and FZD5. ACSF3 was significantly upregulated, and             was involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolism and accelerated liver injury.             These two genes were involved in fatty acids and lipid metabolism. FZD5 was downregulated             and reduced the synthesis of membrane transport protein in the hepatic membrane             and the membrane stability, and accelerated the liver cell apoptosis process.             Six key microRNAs regulated numerous biological functions such as the immune response,             the inflammatory response and glutathione metabolism. This finding provides valuable             insight into the diagnosis and treatment of ALD.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ying Liu"", ids = ""49421151""); list(name = ""Shao-hua Chen"", ids = ""103043000""); list(name = ""Xi Jin"", ids = ""145272814""); list(name = ""You-ming Li"", ids = ""48514882"")",6b64fa265a9cce3713ac05e903a815ad938ef20a; 74b2dcaa6ec1a47a5353ed28d667d104644bf308; 2d5448c233ddbc4eb8e08849fdb0598bf3b6aad7; bb6e57fbda2d3428faefdfba4685c1e5d2fe03d0; 049293d015491d1e49963e76ed5bd4c4d825009f; e20c12c64eba4223c9fcb843a958a9bb02bd1232; 5d4ea3cfb936944eab6e8711ce5790661cb60507; 8b6797163e364e446f502d6155fcafd504bb93b1; e9070642308832539b7fa5b004a590892f2f0efa; 3a88b4cfbbbf48eb0730a18c4840d95d2e0d4898; 25f4b8a9ed4663df2258a227bdf5fba651521137; ac3b9eb661179fd0b13ea49eff476752e26b1cad; 2079a0778279de79b8e2d14446bb83f8f8f5810f; 7bb782a6e422dbc2bd22056a962ff1376e6e9d20; e32a0d8181f076e3d836a0d16743f1993ec98763; fbb6b4f1225f004230d9e75c924a3739b1969197; 4bf26d1ce6a8715f3d6f1423322fe3c5a88dc21b,a2a7f3f9bb943223a7bf2d95f7c5788f92e25bbe; 1e72d2919c18eaca2c0a81ecfc1e95092a61568e; 4805569f505e67b3afc74c7d2c2f25c3b281e803; 6e7e68c9e03466630986752a683d4b36522c281b; 0810624986763367dd56f8711911668496b2848f; 1697578fb038f79f3ef1a5e65b7fc3e0a203ff73; 4a9301ae05b8f629b30dbf97ed20bc3f4c680b43; 0ac012cd63450a8caf2cf2eee8f637360ef92b32; 068dd8f6842a367827e2733e083808bb0d6966cd; fa175ccc9fa1b21c396c389528bca1cc0cbb2cf8; 3009ae7f16646805bcdaa1a2e42cd710456242be; dfffde1e360079b312d4e0847327c1efdf745312; 631e46d8044f6ed0b4638bcebae2f5468ed797ce; dcb131315a273d660489aef3e1dc636329b594fb; 2bf0d878dbd26b4273a9822fa6d74df7e33f025e; c488c189804d71e29287eda2b88026fdad481d3f; 5174fc618ab8d65e1880d29285aa1f28ea17a287; 512c749e6287133b6ca5e7b66b732d3c627b1beb; 1dd289afa7bfbde4233bb72d2525572a059ac866; 059da26ac5903918dfb3b20beef394010789fc7e; 67135bf8a028f2d68fb323a2008e8a2b57484c45; aa4ab9833ce8214819c64f99a01bac3224180384; 61ae8d1e5e3ca600b470f80170df0503df61c455; c82d5e33ed40ef5f020f9cac4f7c14f702039795; 2468ebdf92aa52550c8904b5890abfe869f8a12e; 4b80258d943316d400f8d45ad445a1b713339883; f7fe9c2d4fb347952e3ff68ed0635406c2d35ffb,International journal of molecular medicine,31 3,"

b165ecb4f3e67046999a80cdad42e2dd0392724b,Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated gene is a possible biomarker for discrimination of infiltrative deep penetrating nevi and metastatic vertical growth phase melanoma.,"The deep penetrating nevus (DPN) is a variant of benign melanocytic nevus with clinical and histologic features mimicking vertical growth phase, nodular malignant melanoma (NMM). Because fatal misdiagnosis such as NMM occurs in 29% to 40% of the DPN, molecular differentiation markers are highly desirable. Beyond the clinical demand for precise diagnosis and diagnosis-adapted, preventive therapeutic strategies, the DPN represents a valuable natural model for melanocytic invasion without metastatic potential that per se deserves further investigations. In the present study, at first, we used a genome-wide, microarray-based approach to systematically prescreen for possible molecular markers differentially expressed between selected cases of typical DPN (n=4) and metastatic NMM controls (n=4). Gene expression profiling was done on Affymetrix Human X3P microarrays. Of the 47,000 genes spotted, we identified a list of 227 transcripts, which remained significantly regulated at a false discovery rate of 5%. Subsequently, we verified the expression of a subset of the most interesting transcripts in a larger immunohistochemical series (DPN, n=17; NMM, n=16). Of these transcripts, three were selected for immunohistochemical confirmation: tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, tumor protein D52, and ataxia telangiectasia-mutated gene (ATM). Additional criteria for selection from the list of 227 significantly regulated transcripts were grouping into functional Ingenuity networks and a known melanoma- or cancer-relevant function. Following these criteria, we detected a highly significant up-regulation of ATM transcription in NMM, which was also mirrored by ATM protein up-regulation. In contrast to the other markers, ATM particularly might serve as a suitable diagnostic and reliable discriminator of DPN/NMM because ATM immunoreactivity also showed a reliable staining consistency within all samples of both entities.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexander RÃ¶sch"", ids = ""47278124""); list(name = ""Bernd Becker"", ids = ""46650272""); list(name = ""Stefan Bentink"", ids = ""3321951""); list(name = ""Rainer Spang"", ids = ""48692032""); list(name = ""Annegret Vogl"", ids = ""47358939""); list(name = ""Ilja Hagen"", ids = ""46513061""); list(name = ""MÃ­chael Landthaler"", ids = ""1789961""); list(name = ""Thomas Vogt"", ids = ""47329935"")",41830b4844ff3205aa9ab7373f22caca1094bc3b; 11d6f34bd8f36adc6d2cd1bd4a5f415840505810; f0e573465c31fadceedbca3d0461add357baf697; d8ad3a44ca1b9948cfc28649e6bed687291ed1fd; b07a873cc4970861b8ed616e5f3460703da4f6f4; 2a4e58e0a14caee573cfb2a61737708d31ee54ad; c32e4e6a3fff541fb191a9eead91f47da7753e2e; 7a3e9bd13091b4afb3a68f3052c7ce7f83f1a376; 7ce5b61981f034ee2589d69383bffb32087f4c72; faecbb5d99f663070f9b94b0f0e53276268536a6; 21af368d78363ff705abee9e8c0cff8dd774e5c8,,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",16 11,"

9b2a09b240d0838ad59e19f90224f97ed4bb5fe2,A multilocus association analysis method integrating phenotype and expression data reveals multiple novel associations to flowering time variation in wild-collected Arabidopsis thaliana.,"The adaptation to a new habitat often results in a confounding between genomewide genotype and beneficial alleles. When the confounding is strong, or the allelic effects is weak, it is a major statistical challenge to detect the adaptive polymorphisms. We describe a novel approach to dissect polygenic traits in natural populations. First, candidate adaptive loci are identified by screening for loci directly associated with the adaptive trait or the expression of genes known to affect it. Then, a multilocus genetic architecture is inferred using a backward elimination association analysis across all candidate loci with an adaptive false discovery rate-based threshold. Effects of population stratification are controlled by accounting for genomic kinship in both steps of the analysis and also by simultaneously testing all candidate loci in the multilocus model. We illustrate the method by exploring the polygenic basis of an important adaptive trait, flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana, using public data from the 1,001 genomes project. We revealed associations between 33 (29) loci and flowering time at 10 (16)Â°C in this collection of natural accessions, where standard genomewide association analysis methods detected five (3) loci. The 33 (29) loci explained approximately 55.1 (48.7)% of the total phenotypic variance of the respective traits. Our work illustrates how the genetic basis of highly polygenic adaptive traits in natural populations can be explored in much greater detail using new multilocus mapping approaches taking advantage of prior biological information, genome and transcriptome data.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yanjun Zan"", ids = ""40148310""); list(name = ""Ã–rjan Carlborg"", ids = ""2244732"")",73dd96d42f4c23d6b4e534dc93edb04a449e9a56; 767203e9ade5f65a653db157487b2b75583011d0,,Molecular ecology resources,18 4,"

6650892e20a8174a6f7b741e9246bb8dd31bd366,Automated detection and classification of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in human intracereberal EEG,"Abstract Discrete high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the range of 80â€“500Â Hz have previously been recorded from human epileptic brains using intracereberal EEG and seem to be a reliable biomarker of seizure onset zone in patients with intractable epilepsy. Visual marking of HFOs bursts is tedious, highly time-consuming particularly for analyzing long-term multichannel EEG recordings, inevitably subjective and can be error prone. Thus, the development of automatic, fast and robust detectors is necessary and crucial for HFOs investigation and for propelling their eventual clinical applications. This paper presents a proposed algorithm for detection and classification of HFOs, which is a combination of both smoothed Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) and root mean square (RMS) feature. Performance evaluation in terms of sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) were respectively 90.72% and 8.23% related to process validation. Indeed, the proposed method was efficient in terms of high sensitivity in which the majority of HFOs visually identified by experienced reviewers was correctly detected, and had a lower FDR. This would mean that only a low rate of detected events was misclassified as candidate HFOs events.

338acd3690bf35f3f4948ad2e550a694c1a29808,Navigating through metaproteomics data: a logbook of database searching.,"Metaproteomic research involves various computational challenges during the identification of fragmentation spectra acquired from the proteome of a complex microbiome. These issues are manifold and range from the construction of customized sequence databases, the optimal setting of search parameters to limitations in the identification search algorithms themselves. In order to assess the importance of these individual factors, we studied the effect of strategies to combine different search algorithms, explored the influence of chosen database search settings, and investigated the impact of the size of the protein sequence database used for identification. Furthermore, we applied de novo sequencing as a complementary approach to classic database searching. All evaluations were performed on a human intestinal metaproteome dataset. Pyrococcus furiosus proteome data were used to contrast database searching of metaproteomic data to a classic proteomic experiment. Searching against subsets of metaproteome databases and the use of multiple search engines increased the number of identifications. The integration of P. furiosus sequences in a metaproteomic sequence database showcased the limitation of the target-decoy-controlled false discovery rate approach in combination with large sequence databases. The selection of varying search engine parameters and the application of de novo sequencing represented useful methods to increase the reliability of the results. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for the data analysis that help researchers to establish or improve analysis workflows in metaproteomics.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Thilo Muth"", ids = ""2006748""); list(name = ""Carolin A.

724265e9f501c825bb254a90c0fd44c4a412707b,P14.3 Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in the treatment of refractory auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia,"Introduction: Recent fMRI studies (Owen et al, Science, 2006; Monti et al, NEJM 2010) showed the possibility to use the voluntary modulation of mental states for detecting the residual level of awareness in patients with Disorders of Consciousness (DOC) and for implementing tools for binary communication. Objectives: In order to transfer the paradigms used in fMRI to the more portable EEG technique, this study aims at investigating the possibility to retrieve distinguishable activation patterns during different imagery tasks, by using advanced high resolution EEG methodology in the time and frequency domains. Methods: 61-channels EEG was recorded from 15 healthy volunteers during the execution of three imagery tasks, Playing Tennis (T), Prolonged Grasping (G) and Spatial Navigation in a domestic environment (N), and during Relax (R). EEG traces were projected on a cortical model by solving the electromagnetic linear inverse problem. Power Spectrum Density was computed on cortical waveforms and averaged in four frequency bands (Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma). T-tests for a significance level of 5%, corrected with False Discovery Rate, were performed for T-R, N-R and G-R comparisons and mapped on a cortical model. Results: Statistical maps showed a partial spatial overlapping between cortical areas involved in the execution of the three imagery tasks (T, G, N). However, the specific contribution in different frequency bands (Alpha for the two motor tasks and Beta for the navigation task) allows to separate the imaginative tasks. Conclusions: Results suggest that the high resolution EEG spectral mapping can be an effective way to address the analysis of imaginative functions, allowing to discriminate different mental states without the limitations of the use of an fMRI scanner, with important implications for DOC oriented Brain Computer Interface applications.

eb211d1441615c7f7176c3f57f11ca35316c4810,Rate optimal multiple testing procedure in high-dimensional regression,"Multiple testing and variable selection have gained much attention in statistical theory and methodology research. They are dealing with the same problem of identifying the important variables among many (Jin, 2012). However, there is little overlap in the literature. Research on variable selection has been focusing on selection consistency, i.e., both type I and type II errors converging to zero. This is only possible when the signals are sufficiently strong, contrary to many modern applications. For the regime where the signals are both rare and weak, it is inevitable that a certain amount of false discoveries will be allowed, as long as some error rate can be controlled. In this paper, motivated by the research by Ji and Jin (2012) and Jin (2012) in the rare/weak regime, we extend their UPS procedure for variable selection to multiple testing. Under certain conditions, the new UPT procedure achieves the fastest convergence rate of marginal false non-discovery rates, while controlling the marginal false discovery rate at any designated level $\alpha$ asymptotically. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Pengsheng Ji"", ids = ""40424956""); list(name = ""Zhigen Zhao"", ids = ""2941525"")",b3e9c70969cb73096ce3df1065190a04e568a13a; 53cad19c6fceba2c9827922a2bc649e3eabf4758; bc37cf1f0b7284ec8a4c9d3af6236f4a559b0214; ae66c9375443ff7b360402ebe1c62241a9d3a1b8; 938de376807d00a99657fc9e2d18abe683e336fd; be62a559ee65ea0b8e0e4da95c880da07f1c933a; c794fd003dabe1b4d09ff081ecd9fe0566b729ef,77a108da6a9f81677ee6c341bcf5e066d5bcc19e; a69ce6862603f81c8f74beadcbf69fd09503ef7d; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; a759777f7c4d59bd43f870d98f618ac09ad66fa3; b4ee596014935f02d5496146774d2b6caae92ba9; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 59ee093343177e81ae17ac01f33724c6154a0619; d4fe3369c896dcd3c93f46783c1ad385b8097500; e9c7c7c07166a7b296ea8a2e1b8a4cdaa009f89d; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; 4a6fe45e099fdbee848c09514d634d4dab0b4780; 8141c6e46d958713dcd951c651edaed4a2b06873; 8d4a82f8262abfb55754990665146f8bca94d8d6; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; afa65a3c7d08ba31ee00c576c3b36456ffaf735e; 30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; d635bdf4a3d2db6f0c082d477036d1e5f13ffecb; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; dc5c799d20933dc0d997801f9db104c4c3a2022d; 10ab0830336e3b204202f47aa0fb63a813e3dc71; 46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; f3782cd0efe4195c90e511434c2e61960a58bb6f; 49ee190accef3218e8da267c083d9980b8b516ab; d93d08bdc5b34d2c27077490afbb7df63c9c46f7; 3facebb93b46799e5f97ca7c279cbdfc5ef0bf2d; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; c1dc19f87fa83b4357f0557cbb6c32a4ee0002d7; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; c7a2cd4cedfd39119fc9591df90347c17217f989; 349f97c405795f8eb858067f089dbbf48c523b4d; 8a25f762baa06aac58455d59cf03778feb85caf6; 5db89746b77118f1f6c65f2b47d4074bcba55fa9; 7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263; 2888f87e01c7adfd95f02c52339a7db8ad329677,arXiv: Methodology,,
8963b5c1a754741d6599b95e47818fe3b79a6a51,Preserving Statistical Validity in Adaptive Data Analysis,"A great deal of effort has been devoted to reducing the risk of spurious scientific discoveries, from the use of sophisticated validation techniques, to deep statistical methods for controlling the false discovery rate in multiple hypothesis testing. However, there is a fundamental disconnect between the theoretical results and the practice of data analysis: the theory of statistical inference assumes a fixed collection of hypotheses to be tested, or learning algorithms to be applied, selected non-adaptively before the data are gathered, whereas in practice data is shared and reused with hypotheses and new analyses being generated on the basis of data exploration and the outcomes of previous analyses.
 In this work we initiate a principled study of how to guarantee the validity of statistical inference in adaptive data analysis. As an instance of this problem, we propose and investigate the question of estimating the expectations of m adaptively chosen functions on an unknown distribution given n random samples.
 We show that, surprisingly, there is a way to estimate an exponential in n number of expectations accurately even if the functions are chosen adaptively. This gives an exponential improvement over standard empirical estimators that are limited to a linear number of estimates. Our result follows from a general technique that counter-intuitively involves actively perturbing and coordinating the estimates, using techniques developed for privacy preservation. We give additional applications of this technique to our question.",2015,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Cynthia Dwork"", ids = ""1781565""); list(name = ""Vitaly Feldman"", ids = ""145818608"");

eb3739ea45d55feee43fd88e65ace9462c67deff,A New Procedure for Controlling False Discovery Rate in Large-Scale t-tests,"This paper is concerned with false discovery rate (FDR) control in large-scale multiple testing problems. We first propose a new data-driven testing procedure for controlling the FDR in large-scale t-tests for one-sample mean problem. The proposed procedure achieves exact FDR control in finite sample settings when the populations are symmetric no matter the number of tests or sample sizes. Comparing with the existing bootstrap method for FDR control, the proposed procedure is computationally efficient. We show that the proposed method can control the FDR asymptotically for asymmetric populations even when the test statistics are not independent. We further show that the proposed procedure with a simple correction is as accurate as the bootstrap method to the second-order degree, and could be much more effective than the existing normal calibration. We extend the proposed procedure to two-sample mean problem. Empirical results show that the proposed procedures have better FDR control than existing ones when the proportion of true alternative hypotheses is not too low, while maintaining reasonably good detection ability.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Changliang Zou"", ids = ""3005204""); list(name = ""Haojie Ren"", ids = ""2638027""); list(name = ""Xu Guo"", ids = ""1471119260""); list(name = ""Runze Li"", ids = ""153071858"")",,ccb8d00fcb651d0c8304e3f2b26ee81a28f59d93; a7cf287016d6011bb19e2abe2504b83dca58ea7f; 7335660e55f5537dcb09ca29e689211dacffe40e; 078fb305820f2e2479f2c6f517524eea522373de; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 8c1eed72bb4c630e18c051b062dfab77e12eddb6; 2c64d50c9a9eb1deefb90e3f719f0a2da403e56d; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; aced86a6933b6259ddc1ef6879231f5d370510a8; c3620866f75cf4d2cd498abc91b598ae1ddd1300; 76f667df49db0e5a3a2f4fdd45995a120d3a6c32; ed9716278a7dedc4699622c5a0a9a3ca76740728; 14afa51d4858aedf8b71b263f9f12417324ffce2; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 918f6216cf0c7e95825737fdef804cba610d0785; 2def5ea8b905c5742e989279f14bab82e560a07e; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,
f577d0eafb2779c953b15fc5c5f31f9752938044,Distinct systemic microbiome and microbial translocation are associated with plasma level of anti-CD4 autoantibody in HIV infection,"Microbial signals have been linked to autoantibody induction. Recently, we found that purified anti-CD4 autoantibodies from the plasma of chronic HIV-1-infected patients under viral-suppressed antiretroviral therapy (ART) play a pathologic role in poor CD4+ T cell recovery. The purpose of the study was to investigate the association of systemic microbiome and anti-CD4 autoantibody production in HIV. Plasma microbiome from 12 healthy controls and 22 HIV-infected subjects under viral-suppressed ART were analyzed by MiSeq sequencing. Plasma level of autoantibodies and microbial translocation (LPS, total bacterial 16S rDNA, soluble CD14, and LPS binding protein) were analyzed by ELISA, limulus amebocyte assay, and qPCR. We found that plasma level of anti-CD4 IgGs but not anti-CD8 IgGs was increased in HIV+ subjects compared to healthy controls. HIV+ subjects with plasma anti-CD4 IgGâ€‰>â€‰50â€‰ng/mL (high) had reduced microbial diversity compared to HIV+ subjects with anti-CD4 IgG â‰¤ 50â€‰ng/mL (low). Moreover, plasma anti-CD4 IgG level was associated with elevated microbial translocation and reduced microbial diversity in HIV+ subjects. The Alphaproteobacteria class was significantly enriched in HIV+ subjects with low anti-CD4 IgG compared to patients with high anti-CD4 IgG even after controlling for false discovery rate (FDR). The microbial components were different from the phylum to genus level in HIV+ subjects with high anti-CD4 IgGs compared to the other two groups, but these differences were not significant after controlling for FDR. These results suggest that systemic microbial translocation and microbiome may associate with anti-CD4 autoantibody production in ART-treated HIV disease.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Wanli Xu"", ids = ""7978599""); list(name = ""Zhenwu Luo"", ids = ""5181335""); list(name = ""Alexander V.

522e860ede98d40630f5884beaeff4bdfd5cfd70,Comparative analysis of gene sets in the gene ontology space under the multiple hypothesis testing framework,"The gene ontology (GO) resource can be used as a powerful tool to uncover the properties shared among, and specific to, a list of genes produced by high-throughput functional genomics studies, such as microarray studies. In the comparative analysis of several gene lists, researchers maybe interested in knowing which GO terms are enriched in one list of genes but relatively depleted in another. Statistical tests such as Fisher's exact test or Chi-square test can be performed to search for such GO terms. However, because multiple GO terms are tested simultaneously, individual p-values from individual tests do not serve as good indicators for picking GO terms. Furthermore, these multiple tests are highly correlated, usual multiple testing procedures that work under an independence assumption are not applicable. In this paper we introduce a procedure, based on false discovery rate (FDR), to treat this correlated multiple testing problem. This procedure calculates a moderately conserved estimator of q-value for every GO term. We identify the GO terms with q-values that satisfy a desired level as the significant GO terms.

The upper threshold applied to the p-value in making this determination (often 5% in the scientific literature) determines the Type I error rate; i.e., the probability of making a Type I error when the null hypothesis is true. Multiple hypothesis testing is concerned with testing several statistical hypotheses simultaneously. Defining statistical significance is a more complex problem in this setting. A longstanding definition of statistical significance for multiple hypothesis tests involves the probability of making one or more Type I errors among the family of hypothesis tests, called the family-wise error rate. However, there exist other well established formulations of statistical significance for multiple hypothesis tests. The Bayesian framework for classification naturally allows one to calculate the probability that each null hypothesis is true given the observed data (Efron et al. 2001, Storey 2003), and several frequentist definitions of multiple hypothesis testing significance are also well established (Shaffer 1995). Soric (1989) proposed a framework for quantifying the statistical significance of multiple hypothesis tests based on the proportion of Type I errors among all hypothesis tests called statistically significant. He called statistically significant hypothesis tests discoveries and proposed that one be concerned about the rate of false discoveries1 when testing multiple hypotheses. This false discovery rate is robust to the false positive paradox and is particularly useful in exploratory analyses, where one is more concerned with having mostly true findings among a set of statistically significant discoveries rather than guarding against one or more false positives. Benjamini & Hochberg (1995) provided the first implementation of false discovery rates with known operating characteristics. The idea of quantifying the rate of false discoveries is directly related to several pre-existing ideas, such as Bayesian misclassification rates and the positive predictive value (Storey 2003).",2011,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""John D.

We present a fragment-ion indexing method, and its implementation in peptide identification tool MSFragger, that enables a more than 100-fold improvement in speed over most existing proteome database search tools. Using several large proteomic data sets, we demonstrate how MSFragger empowers the open database search concept for comprehensive identification of peptides and all their modified forms, uncovering dramatic differences in modification rates across experimental samples and conditions. We further illustrate its utility using proteinâ€“RNA cross-linked peptide data and using affinity purification experiments where we observe, on average, a 300% increase in the number of identified spectra for enriched proteins.

be6c66c09a34ac5e103bdeaf64c0fa3261c99ca6,Detection of changes of high-frequency activity by statistical time-frequency analysis in epileptic spikes,"OBJECTIVE
A novel type of statistical time-frequency analysis was developed to elucidate changes of high-frequency EEG activity associated with epileptic spikes.


METHODS
The method uses the Gabor Transform and detects changes of power in comparison to background activity using t-statistics that are controlled by the false discovery rate (FDR) to correct type I error of multiple testing. The analysis was applied to EEGs recorded at 2000 Hz from three patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.


RESULTS
Spike-related increase of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) was clearly shown in the FDR-controlled t-spectra: it was most dramatic in spikes recorded from the hippocampus when the hippocampus was the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Depression of fast activity was observed immediately after the spikes, especially consistently in the discharges from the hippocampal SOZ. It corresponded to the slow wave part in case of spike-and-slow-wave complexes, but it was noted even in spikes without apparent slow waves. In one patient, a gradual increase of power above 200 Hz preceded spikes.


CONCLUSIONS
FDR-controlled t-spectra clearly detected the spike-related changes of HFOs that were unclear in standard power spectra.

f61a456fa7a6fe55d9c6f5290dccc99edf99a94c,Chronic auditory hallucinations in schizophrenic patients: MR analysis of the coincidence between functional and morphologic abnormalities.,"PURPOSE
To prospectively evaluate if functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging abnormalities associated with auditory emotional stimuli coexist with focal brain reductions in schizophrenic patients with chronic auditory hallucinations.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Institutional review board approval was obtained and all participants gave written informed consent. Twenty-one right-handed male patients with schizophrenia and persistent hallucinations (started to hear hallucinations at a mean age of 23 years +/- 10, with 15 years +/- 8 of mean illness duration) and 10 healthy paired participants (same ethnic group [white], age, and education level [secondary school]) were studied. Functional echo-planar T2*-weighted (after both emotional and neutral auditory stimulation) and morphometric three-dimensional gradient-recalled echo T1-weighted MR images were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM2) software. Brain activation images were extracted by subtracting those with emotional from nonemotional words. Anatomic differences were explored by optimized voxel-based morphometry. The functional and morphometric MR images were overlaid to depict voxels statistically reported by both techniques. A coincidence map was generated by multiplying the emotional subtracted functional MR and volume decrement morphometric maps. Statistical analysis used the general linear model, Student t tests, random effects analyses, and analysis of covariance with a correction for multiple comparisons following the false discovery rate method.


RESULTS
Large coinciding brain clusters (P < .005) were found in the left and right middle temporal and superior temporal gyri. Smaller coinciding clusters were found in the left posterior and right anterior cingular gyri, left inferior frontal gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus.

We previously showed the negative effect of respiratory artifacts on the error of the correlation model, connecting external and internal motion, for meaningful episodes from treatments with the Accuray CyberKnifer. We applied on-line model checking, an iterative fail safety method, to respiratory motion. In this paper we vary its prediction parameter and decrease the previously rather high false discovery rate by 30.3%. In addition, we were able to increase the number of detected meaningful episodes through adaptive parameter choice by 452%.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sven-Thomas Antoni"", ids = ""1994997""); list(name = ""Xintao Ma"", ids = ""1680443""); list(name = ""Sibylle Schupp"", ids = ""1706338""); list(name = ""Alexander Schlaefer"", ids = ""3236423"")",,ffcad9114d41f2db610f05d3570347af232ac81c; 472a9653c938e841970e248009d20e820049d08c; e567dddae1345338186501d05c24c133a0436de7; 3acab80b0a5f4fef386c8e919349d31f0abb13b1; f6ec98126f4bd844661192db80394924fff3ea59; c2429aa90b6e5d4b9d28d8d711a4966c30e22bf3; 728286c94905c274db2255c7d3c420555e0ba541; 1e3dc5d6440ab73cfb546f911c0e7da04a5301af; 4403b40406b37d5f044c35e9ec6cd681e11d3612,,,182-186
e010584f68816b306fa038ca812d0c8b4ba011a9,Outlier sums for differential gene expression analysis.,"We propose a method for detecting genes that, in a disease group, exhibit unusually high gene expression in some but not all samples. This can be particularly useful in cancer studies, where mutations that can amplify or turn off gene expression often occur in only a minority of samples. In real and simulated examples, the new method often exhibits lower false discovery rates than simple t-statistic thresholding. We also compare our approach to the recent cancer profile outlier analysis proposal of Tomlins and others (2005).",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Robert Tibshirani"", ids = ""1761784""); list(name = ""Trevor J.

8cfb4c5bfdc21f0babe4a0bb0920134771ed5bff,Identification of protein biomarkers in Dupuytren's contracture using surface enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS).,"BACKGROUND
To study the protein expression profiles associated with Dupuytren's contracture (DC) to identify potential disease protein biomarkers (PBM) using a proteomic technology--Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS).


METHODS
Normal and disease palmar fascia from DC patients were analyzed using Ciphergen's SELDI-TOF-MS Protein Biological System II (PBSII) ProteinChip reader. Analysis of the resulting SELDI-TOF spectra was carried out using the peak cluster analysis program (BioMarker Wizard, Ciphergen). Common peak clusters were then filtered using a bootstrap algorithm called SAM (Significant Analysis of Microarrays) for increased fidelity in our analysis.


RESULTS
Several differentially expressed low molecular weight (<20 kDa) tissue proteins were identified. Spectra generated using both ZipTipC18 aided Au array and WCX2 array based SELDI-TOF-MS were reproducible, with an average peak cluster mass standard deviation for both methods of <1.74 x10(-4). Initial peak cluster analysis of the SELDI spectra identified both up-(14) and down-(3)regulated proteins associated with DC. Further analysis of the peak cluster data using the bootstrap algorithm SAM identified three disease-associated protein features (4600.8 Da, 10254.5 Da, and 11405.1 Da) that were elevated (5.45, 11.7, and 4.28 fold, respectively, with a 0% median false discovery rate).


CONCLUSION
SELDI-TOF-MS identified three potential low molecular weight tissue protein markers (p4.6DC, p1ODC, p11.7DC) for DC. The ability of SELDI-TOF-MS to resolve low molecular weight proteins suggests that the method may provide a means of deciphering the biomarker-rich low molecular weight region of the human proteome. Application of such novel technology may help clinicians to focus on specific molecular abnormalities in diseases with no known molecular pathogenesis, and uncover therapeutic and/or diagnostic targets.",2006,Medicine,"list(name = ""David B.

To date, the analytical methods of published GWAS have largely been limited to single single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or SNP-SNP pair analysis, coupled with multiplicity control using the Bonferroni procedure to control family wise error rate (FWER). However, since SNPs in typical GWAS are in linkage disequilibrium, simple Bonferonni correction is usually over conservative and therefore leads to a loss of efficiency. In addition, controlling FWER may be too stringent for GWAS where the number of SNPs to be tested is enormous. It is more desirable to control the false discovery rate (FDR). We introduce here a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based PLIS testing procedure for GWAS. It captures SNP dependency by an HMM, and based which, provides precise FDR control for identifying susceptibility loci.",2012,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Zhi Wei"", ids = ""145312585"")",10f156ae6cf7d1802958d69d5c8fe03ee211159d; bee06da05ee863ef9c96ee7b21b9e2043d431248,,Methods in molecular biology,802,"

49a395dca81e418ad922e4f7152450f2b332088f,"Genetic variants in endotoxin signalling pathway, domestic endotoxin exposure and asthma exacerbations.","BACKGROUND
We investigated the interaction between genetic variants in endotoxin signalling pathway and domestic endotoxin exposure in relation to asthma presence, and amongst children with asthma, we explored the association of these genetic variants and endotoxin exposure with hospital admissions due to asthma exacerbations.


METHODS
In a case-control study, we analysed data from 824 children (417 asthmatics, 407 controls; age 5-18 yr). Amongst asthmatics, we extracted data on hospitalization for asthma exacerbation from medical records. Endotoxin exposure was measured in dust samples collected from homes. We included 26 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the final analysis (5 CD14, 7LY96 and 14 TLR4).


RESULTS
Two variants remained significantly associated with hospital admissions with asthma exacerbations after correction for multiple testing: for CD14 SNP rs5744455, carriers of T allele had decreased risk of repeated hospital admissions compared with homozygotes for C allele [OR (95% CI), 0.42 (0.25-0.88), p = 0.01, False Discovery Rate (FDR) p = 0.02]; for LY96 SNP rs17226566, C-allele carriers were at a lower risk of hospital admissions compared with T-allele homozygotes [0.59 (0.38-0.90), p = 0.01, FDR p = 0.04]. We observed two interactions between SNPs in CD14 and LY96 with environmental endotoxin exposure in relation to hospital admissions due to asthma exacerbation which remained significant after correction for multiple testing (CD14 SNPs rs2915863 and LY96 SNP rs17226566).


CONCLUSION
Amongst children with asthma, genetic variants in CD14 and LY96 may increase the risk of hospital admissions with acute exacerbations.

2ed81d2398bfe8c5df9f184ed41628201a04842f,Genetic variation and cognitive dysfunction in opioidâ€treated patients with cancer,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
The effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the cognitive function of opioid-treated patients with cancer until now have not been explored, but they could potentially be related to poor functioning. This study aimed at identifying associations between SNPs of candidate genes, high opioid dose, and cognitive dysfunction.


METHODS
Cross-sectional multicenter study (European Pharmacogenetic Opioid Study, 2005-2008); 1586 patients; 113 SNPs from 41 genes.


INCLUSION CRITERIA
cancer, age â‰¥18Â year, opioid treatment, and available genetic data. Cognitive assessment by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).


ANALYSES
SNPs were rejected if violation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (PÂ <Â 0.0005), or minor allele frequency <5%; patients were randomly divided into discovery sample (2/3 for screening) and validation sample (1/3 for confirmatory test); false discovery rate of 10% for determining associations (Benjamini-Hochberg method). Co-dominant, dominant, and recessive models were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests.


RESULTS
In the co-dominant model significant associations (PÂ <Â 0.05) between MMSE scores and SNPs in the HTR3E,TACR1, and IL6 were observed in the discovery sample, but the replication in the validation sample did not confirm it. Associations between MMSE scores among patients receiving â‰¥400Â mg morphine equivalent dose/day and SNPs in TNFRSF1B,TLR5,HTR2A, and ADRA2A were observed, but they could not be confirmed in the validation sample. After correction for multiple testing, no SNPs were significant in the discovery sample. Dominant and recessive models also did not confirm significant associations.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings did not support influence of those SNPs analyzed to explain cognitive dysfunction in opioid-treated patients with cancer.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Geana Paula Kurita"", ids = ""3290182""); list(name = ""Ola Ekholm"", ids = ""6589408""); list(name = ""Stein Kaasa"", ids = ""2373918""); list(name = ""PÃ¥l Klepstad"", ids = ""3881403""); list(name = ""Frank Skorpen"", ids = ""6813653""); list(name = ""Per SjÃ¸gren"", ids = ""34938556"")",636257b107ff792cfe537f6b26abc623a1e47c89; ab664f9ad0e866e36f36a6ad4aa8a7fce2b8985f; d1a627516c41b903a94af20bcba97ab2fe09ceb4; fe15b2540830ddb011a39927a1212beff4f17889,4987ec063f459805ce795a11982f0211b1fbf8e6; a11fbdfebf6a898679e99f40b4d2aed327c5346c; 62462f2ed5bbc42f02e4ca7e7e3a245497d90485; c8c2f958fca3200408fd3ab3ce0357f244916ad8; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; ce17e521d5629b85c9207972282561665e822025; 8d5e9975b7509cafcb4ce9fb4cd5c69f47a5a741; 5e65e90a6dea6623d26163d12e4bbca6264aa221; d2fd8c1cbd1b23dbd21a9e66e261ab5eb2d3f15d; 0cb84b5f4f6c2072978ef5f0d56f2f5ac116c126; 736eb0604296d3f8f8ab1401f0387d23f208ff9e; 884df2ca6e38c476a5be942b7cdf6e335f0354df; 5e34bdd13ef42e295829d41da2d82d0a747e4b53; 46abbbd805bef0c071d94b50e4a702ebef265939; c9bfd81feb829a2dcd41d4ec1498052516f63970; d91d656d78ccd3eb327e34a6cf404f0303827016; 6097beba7f61f3630ea82bc44bd39f22b24a0eb9; 7697d978a0eb9ee70e0e5c4a52a0cb6d1b0b2847; 3a792e4ff12ae7623711706ff0dfb0b09a42dc0c; c0669244ca03002382b642aa0d744c101e2fa04b; 37a15ed8d05a72098c069715efd0aa44d70500b5; 900d588edeec58cdd57e54026610f634821946a1; c7574e5156406500b2d88d97a6a5ef91cffdc35f; 820f9d8a56159ba1d89acf3699d4c3790709a96c; 02fde6818fb300d04564bbbff0a08f6f4e8cb55f; 7dd9db6024e231305e1f4e5e3cbc35936110636b; e0b160b0a37c17d3903550c9dd67a4c65c22aed0; f3fd352930f3211be1805819fbebb12acef868f8; a501f8f9a1a358e148573dca060eada756a5adca; 1ad2efbac4c9a281596f1774ef03d910fb4d5814; 8cb7563530f70b3c22f1477d6f4295c5decf4545; c2ee2bbe181629d5a32c45e8f7c527654dfb1aca; e300e30a95fc4520ea42c125c9b201fc859117af; 217eb66036f19881cc1910d81102bf008bf6d1fd; 77172eeec2204bf711a9ca4f9579dbd56f90bfff; 182b8a3f7ae1431bac919508f370dbfe766047c2; 05043cc44c382c4c1e5a0cddc313d4c7120cd646; 8dfeecd4fefd5bc8654d5608a0b5c8a6e89d3570; 9fd27a38222144cc690046b6773b754c99f8e617; acb32fa304b5554eb83f567b571f5684c0ef7f2e; 79197c707c1145de813fb8071bb9f3ee088854b8; 11eaefccc8a2216af058ce13ad0be3671774969c; ebec14881bdd5e43379e9c15d219ac7aa2e28bbd; 12d72a261ab040f4576085c926e22bba749676c3; 589c3bd10f6d370031d5f849cf0a6e6f2cc001ff; 0f74ebc442efbd11777f3d5af7e18fa83c751182; 03cc8995e92afaa380b72abb6a594b44ce5b4394; b48ab4107fe53661d8001afae89244332aec15a8; b296ca0771f48be42e8336d650db089b9f4d83d9; dd0459317cde0a9f09f8806562eddb52b8af7eb6; 0d8cbcc41c13bd043ad8e023c48702f64a9e0be7; e6d16be04a7bca54f7b33531483a89fb059ccd51; b6bd26b47e69ab397c87bbeac25598b7fbdcc4fa; e236e2758e46c843a9595cde32a468664ed6cebf; b7e8d295a1ffd8873d89eecc57deaccbb55c1e4c; c2b1eab16b833b6451ce2bc12477c40c2274e802; c22ac1dad6d244e54ed06b9ec6911451a4b430ea; 613dd8c2f0175e235753653103172e1005828d1d; 0932559c786cd76d78b4bddc1fc7a052e28ec6eb; 07384354d3d520c99ecbfc3fcabd4902de088bfc; 5f5085f8d0751a5f080458794a7827769551dab5; 71068f5b11bb5f59d14668a4eb90eae3e4f4e2b5; 5c066eca1f65ec6ab84f04b5e2b76be97dbd5d2c,Brain and Behavior,6,
0dc1850c187f19f8d030a570ec80626023d9d71a,FastGCN: A GPU Accelerated Tool for Fast Gene Co-Expression Networks,"Gene co-expression networks comprise one type of valuable biological networks. Many methods and tools have been published to construct gene co-expression networks; however, most of these tools and methods are inconvenient and time consuming for large datasets. We have developed a user-friendly, accelerated and optimized tool for constructing gene co-expression networks that can fully harness the parallel nature of GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) architectures. Genetic entropies were exploited to filter out genes with no or small expression changes in the raw data preprocessing step. Pearson correlation coefficients were then calculated. After that, we normalized these coefficients and employed the False Discovery Rate to control the multiple tests. At last, modules identification was conducted to construct the co-expression networks. All of these calculations were implemented on a GPU. We also compressed the coefficient matrix to save space. We compared the performance of the GPU implementation with those of multi-core CPU implementations with 16 CPU threads, single-thread C/C++ implementation and single-thread R implementation. Our results show that GPU implementation largely outperforms single-thread C/C++ implementation and single-thread R implementation, and GPU implementation outperforms multi-core CPU implementation when the number of genes increases. With the test dataset containing 16,000 genes and 590 individuals, we can achieve greater than 63 times the speed using a GPU implementation compared with a single-thread R implementation when 50 percent of genes were filtered out and about 80 times the speed when no genes were filtered out.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Meimei Liang"", ids = ""34408504""); list(name = ""Futao Zhang"", ids = ""50212870""); list(name = ""Gulei Jin"", ids = ""11522307""); list(name = ""Jun Zhu"", ids = ""145296847"")",f141a98815548a8c5b2e37d853bccbb1d1807909; b28f8f4f49e136de61fbf0d2dd247b236d1b9d3b; d5ef22d09bdfa655094d2caa534ba041da0d7d83; a4594259a944f8d466ab1fe6631ed61d590227f6; f4367b26d88402e110e43f02a0bff4fac568182a; d0f8b1a5778cbc9982e15a71b59f681ff6445a6a; b98f7bf7b0359eab4aecbef19fe6987d968f4992; 3a3256ab94a4af91c2ddaf2388e56d2dcaa4e5d6; 4534978fa1ae38bfe8ec9c75a8b95e5011819449; ae2164e0358f21a22f47d01a58745f09ac0c4dea; 6c213b8c33f85290cd269e94dc3c8750e4fedeed; 0d74bb35a655f61fb6498fae81f2b9674d1b0f81; d5c2a62c0b2df9f88ab02a355c73170d32647970; 2416d518fccf6804a025c631a67ad7bc59d74fe4; e65c4d3b30aec4c1189eb8c3288abbddb6c8be79; b56dc685111eb2f59e49e06af8eeccb3031fc88c; dd4cd3dd616d69d489fa0dfed5af87c720f41491,7d2a9ce2d2057e2263f64aa13017d6fa463121c4; 5fba98bee8393f740aa1c635832aa88fc11247d5; e168b704aea11697dfc2caf0558bbf3f224201ae; f38635327c9bff0bd83d9db8213c0ac2f0b45536; 69d33e8415399f7db1a0481783d41b854804d018; cf05b38502b09b29fefe2bbc72406a9f672d8b28; 57bccbb0164631d3c9d98912c069f5b8ade60040; 9be7c6167760d84b9d1cbc930ed6fe8397ec2d81; 093e9457948bbda749c04d8c5c003b114d1ac584; 2bbf413f36f366fa73da4dc028a32131b5d205d6; dbceed66fa1fa7b925181e96609d1c8a9231ecb2; 219e8dfd0e1fed5a37fe8b3d67e9ceb0aba9c190; 9184e66e419fc4048c3c0af70630ab3715bb7eea; 81aa971c12672bce80245bfce33dd7d1252c2818; 35b3676646fd06cc5874f419a2e8d0b4bb45464c; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; 226b33630ccad152859ad95ef7985a50fd89269a; 882667dff246b7341b4f23ffa35b61ed3ff47b56; ea3d12d8db29341b280adeb649f6332637ce94ca; f74c526d01e8d7d910a41a3fdf6587e157868c4f; 4e5216ff091691afeea8610ceea49c15c11e63a6; 93086b3d6d3fb1ac72783a892f43f5a5a84b34a1; fad3cd73f2e5927595640d97375ea302b68caff1; 39dae53515afb42664369c291ec6d1ce34d778bd; 00ae5e12df354c4c70b7d51863c6f9f15e44a46a; 8da75d05f622adf6501df3e259c820c246b675e2; 452d61a7d30b3f57794d078155467238f6aa38f7; 7dc7b8e8e4827bb73b99ec77a6a23e5c9a93de84; 5280a5787164561dcdd8b88d3d3c521ab638378d; 7928076e4c72d9e8e33fde9a0c3362809833191d; 2150be5aa16f0e57c4fced90498c0841462e647c; 67926b0dd4416819b368b93aab95bc4830e8be0e; cdaa23d2afdaa77fdbb74f71c87fd85e76d71165; 6d12a1d23b21a9b170118a56386552bc5d4727de; 7c26a3d7345944454f090701c8014e19c19438b5; a1e529eeee7ac4159cbed38d8673d398f7fc3d33; 8b81af7d7eab9dd6c6bafaa9856028c83cd447eb,PLoS ONE,10,
6d4900b31b92afec8aa6185b2f89a6fde113dddd,DNA methylation markers in combination with skeletal and dental ages to improve age estimation in children.,"Age estimation is critical in forensic science, in competitive sports and games and in other age-related fields, but the current methods are suboptimal. The combination of age-associated DNA methylation markers with skeletal age (SA) and dental age (DA) may improve the accuracy and precision of age estimation, but no study has examined this topic. In the current study, we measured SA (GP, TW3-RUS, and TW3-Carpal methods) and DA (Demirjian and Willems methods) by X-ray examination in 124 Chinese children (78 boys and 46 girls) aged 6-15 years. To identify age-associated CpG sites, we analyzed methylome-wide DNA methylation profiling by using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip system in 48 randomly selected children. Five CpG sites were identified as associated with chronologic age (CA), with an absolute value of Pearson's correlation coefficient (r)>0.5 (p<0.01) and a false discovery rate<0.01. The validation of age-associated CpG sites was performed using droplet digital PCR techniques in all 124 children. After validation, four CpG sites for boys and five CpG sites for girls were further adopted to build the age estimation model with SA and DA using multivariate linear stepwise regressions. These CpG sites were located at 4 known genes: DDO, PRPH2, DHX8, and ITGA2B and at one unknown gene with the Illumina ID number of 22398226. The accuracy of age estimation methods was compared according to the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). The best single measure for SA was the TW3-RUS method (MAE=0.69years, RMSE=0.95years) in boys, and the GP method (MAE=0.74years, RMSE=0.94years) in girls. For DA, the Willems method was the best single measure for both boys (MAE=0.63years, RMSE=0.78years) and girls (MAE=0.54years, RMSE=0.68years). The models that incorporated SA and DA with the methylation levels of age-associated CpG sites provided the highest accuracy of age estimation in both boys (MAE=0.47years, R2=0.886) and girls (MAE=0.33years, R2=0.941). Cross validation of the results confirmed the reliability and validity of the models. In conclusion, age-associated DNA methylation markers in combination with SA and DA greatly improve the accuracy of age estimation in Chinese children. This method may be applied in forensic science, in competitive sports and games and in other age-related fields.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lei Shi"", ids = ""144575979""); list(name = ""Fan Jiang"", ids = ""144955893""); list(name = ""Fengxiu Ouyang"", ids = ""7847880""); list(name = ""Jun Zhang"", ids = ""40210332""); list(name = ""Zhimin Wang"", ids = ""47196955""); list(name = ""Xiaoming Shen"", ids = ""48946908"")",a1b4e5ff1856e22245bcff6b83239d746d9006bc; a7a0358f7f0964e1637796beca04aeb1ec5ddd00; a7d81a75d002d85a8fd1c99ea80bf1e30375b22f; 05df200e7f819b6fe754f41f657269947e5757db; 5705efbd790c04b26766bc9669354ee3aa399546; d7509fe8ad9357cceda613e13864a7e65b5078e9; 57e3cec507d28884018c07fc09763f58dd958175; e4fd6dae732df135550a5003d48a91a4816f37e7; bec37b5f5d342716bbd7901a82891e1fc173525e; a0b457432cf3c9c96afed2394d1609e645b40055,,Forensic science international.

The ENCODE Consortium is integrating multiple technologies and approaches in a collective effort to discover and define the functional elements encoded in the human genome, including genes, transcripts, and transcriptional regulatory regions, together with their attendant chromatin states and DNA methylation patterns. In the process, standards to ensure high-quality data have been implemented, and novel algorithms have been developed to facilitate analysis. Data and derived results are made available through a freely accessible database. Here we provide an overview of the project and the resources it is generating and illustrate the application of ENCODE data to interpret the human genome.

There are currently three promising areas for the use of big data in healthcare: precision medicine, electronic medical records and the internet of things. Two programming languages have gained momentum in data science: R and Python. Regarding the statistical techniques, it is expected that machine learning (especially classification and regression trees), methodologies for controlling spurious associations (such as Bonferroni correction and false discovery rate) and methodologies for dimension reduction (such as principal components analysis and propensity scores) will be increasingly used. Privacy is an issue that will become ever more important in data analysis. The use of big data in healthcare will bring enormous gains in terms of costs, time and lives saved, and needs to be actively defended by data scientists and epidemiologists.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chiavegatto Filho"", ids = ""143989753""); list(name = ""Alexandre Dias Porto"", ids = ""77861066"")",c2984053ffe307da48bece54fb6a239d46684c32; ff890ef8b952c7215b229744fa9a819947529757; dec40d8a0c29e8705827efc38a959b5492619ceb; 23450db05886b825e25dbd5a02f8b830b2501234; 3275d3d98dfb38e44a80a841916c7a3d27f168e7; 538b133a8b01936e6f26ef2e735d2504b2bc2696,,Epidemiologia e ServiÃ§os de SaÃºde,24,325-332
a3ebcf57746762779fb95dceba5f8d2c9f01b998,Bayesian Multi-SNP Genetic Association Analysis: Control of FDR and Use of Summary Statistics,"Multi-SNP genetic association analysis has become increasingly important in analyzing data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and molecular quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping studies. In this paper, we propose novel computational approaches to address two outstanding issues in Bayesian multi-SNP genetic association analysis: namely, the control of false positive discoveries of identified association signals and the maximization of the efficiency of statistical inference by utilizing summary statistics. Quantifying the strength and uncertainty of genetic association signals has been a long-standing theme in statistical genetics. However, there is a lack of formal statistical procedures that can rigorously control type I errors in multi-SNP analysis. We propose an intuitive hierarchical representation of genetic association signals based on Bayesian posterior probabilities, which subsequently enables rigorous control of false discovery rate (FDR) and construction of Bayesian credible sets. From the perspective of statistical data reduction, we examine the computational approaches of multi-SNP analysis using z-statistics from single-SNP association testing and conclude that they likely yield conservative results comparing to using individual-level data. Built on this result, we propose a set of sufficient summary statistics that can lead to identical results as individual-level data without sacrificing power. Our novel computational approaches are implemented in the software package, DAP-G (https://github.com/xqwen/dap), which applies to both GWASs and genome-wide molecular QTL mapping studies. It is highly computationally efficient and approximately 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art implementation of Bayesian multi-SNP analysis software. We demonstrate the proposed computational approaches using carefully constructed simulation studies and illustrate a complete workflow for multi-SNP analysis of cis expression quantitative trait loci using the whole blood data from the GTEx project.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Yeji Lee"", ids = ""49380029""); list(name = ""Francesca Luca"", ids = ""47080792""); list(name = ""Roger Pique-Regi"", ids = ""1406758021""); list(name = ""Xiaoquan Wen"", ids = ""36836750"")",8229d7f58bab804a138e710a926a75aaefe7d807; d3b01ce89ef7fd080890b309ea6926817609a787; d8cfdb075bf76e1ba6279337ac975a1b0d3d55bb; 8f08392a2e978ade1dfdf7722af32dc73a1afc20; 2ad2fc1b588f64b47635eb6187cc9352f8076d28; 8e6558e09466376d9482ed871dfafd248a75a2fd,8141e7d485f9c589e5297695a6f5588cf7c19cfc; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; a44ee4e44b8aa9e0257761dade1401c1ba18d7e3; 9a17919aed460f59dbcf4d280fd601598995f35e; d2ffae187d5c325a6ca5a70bc7b7cb6b7fa05b7b; 44d86f3ba9167f4931dae729d814c13fbc7a0efb; 1c1d9a7c9a51fbd2046a6c2262a24ecb4ed37b3d; b89708ee9a76638abca5b45782f491193d3b6e64; ae0459f3af3d9d841d4f03c174507523010a408a; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; b4ef47ed4677c58c32adb2f07cd72042a6824106; 2e9306072e8abe2bc4b9630517681bda5de3c762; e643dee9ef430b7b26c409d32fb0f72779dba48b; ac0d267d142702948752a6e4fcf4a2699ba564d4; 55b8eceee4287a247cd271c8b32be61564e40889; afbb4916bd1de07f6c1baa614b1d3c57451cadfd; 310e6a925850a80ccc5c29f813c71f666a14fa39; 9386ed54aba167a251886ec18e2eb2b36aeecfc6; b3aae0ce0606743f619986499e65742f81347d76; 7c392d2bb94834b282361d009ce02e6f5e202767; 328ffc2e64c790a9467503c3ba37cca3f9ab66a7; 09e37c45e9a6785280f1abfd66bd59367c6ef53c; d1f2d78bf551b97e4c6e0a522d40ce837265c683; 6b5a006e964a70cf18477a9f42695c75e0ec927f; 36950960d98fb8da5a43b5adc8e33b25d31f1f95,bioRxiv,,

We analyzed the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (three cohorts aged 18-23, 45-50, or 70-75 at baseline in 1996, N =Â 34,191) merged with emissions data for 10 heavy metals (As, Be, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) from the National Pollutant Inventory. Over 20-year follow-up, 2,584 women (7.6%) reported incident diabetes. Cox proportional hazards regression models showed that women aged 45-50 at baseline had higher diabetes risk in association with exposure to total air emissions, total water emissions, all individual metals air emissions, and six individual water emissions. After correction for false discovery rate, nine of 11 air emissions and five water emissions remained significant. Associations were not observed for land-based emissions, or for younger or older cohorts. Emissions were dominated by mining, electricity generation and other metals-related industrial processes.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael S Hendryx"", ids = ""5946413""); list(name = ""Juhua Luo"", ids = ""1704234""); list(name = ""Catherine Chojenta"", ids = ""6047647""); list(name = ""Julie E Byles"", ids = ""8272828"")",,,International journal of environmental health research,,"

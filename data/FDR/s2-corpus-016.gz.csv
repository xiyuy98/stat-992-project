39289b35f04f7792667d2308ea96ad1461371538,Bayes multiple decision functions.,"This paper deals with the problem of simultaneously making many (M) binary decisions based on one realization of a random data matrix X. M is typically large and X will usually have M rows associated with each of the M decisions to make, but for each row the data may be low dimensional. Such problems arise in many practical areas such as the biological and medical sciences, where the available dataset is from microarrays or other high-throughput technology and with the goal being to decide which among of many genes are relevant with respect to some phenotype of interest; in the engineering and reliability sciences; in astronomy; in education; and in business. A Bayesian decision-theoretic approach to this problem is implemented with the overall loss function being a cost-weighted linear combination of Type I and Type II loss functions. The class of loss functions considered allows for use of the false discovery rate (FDR), false nondiscovery rate (FNR), and missed discovery rate (MDR) in assessing the quality of decision. Through this Bayesian paradigm, the Bayes multiple decision function (BMDF) is derived and an efficient algorithm to obtain the optimal Bayes action is described. In contrast to many works in the literature where the rows of the matrix X are assumed to be stochastically independent, we allow a dependent data structure with the associations obtained through a class of frailty-induced Archimedean copulas. In particular, non-Gaussian dependent data structure, which is typical with failure-time data, can be entertained. The numerical implementation of the determination of the Bayes optimal action is facilitated through sequential Monte Carlo techniques. The theory developed could also be extended to the problem of multiple hypotheses testing, multiple classification and prediction, and high-dimensional variable selection. The proposed procedure is illustrated for the simple versus simple hypotheses setting and for the composite hypotheses setting through simulation studies. The procedure is also applied to a subset of a microarray data set from a colon cancer study.",2013,Mathematics; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wensong Wu"", ids = ""5736019""); list(name = ""E William Augusto PeÃ±a"", ids = ""2281697"")",fd366aae5780b1385eb2acf075160bd97a96c131,b907404e5676c338f25592e582abd91a4b2ef2c2; 0b1df01f2fed42b69e2abfec7e841eb7570cefd4; 754e2117edff09f7dc575d0073afedc4cc6b0123; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; 2cacce5d0e1fd084d43de4ac9d6cacf52942fd2a; 69dc160e2861b0d6b9bcb8d3d058593326c8d5e9; 6b9f7f214abbe504b8ba69be77c030eb1fc44412; 03be636697c84eb22114f09de6c1bea215cc87c8; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 95686586f26d5a1d152db72f6283c7a73335a513; 66bdfe49b992411a5c302d751cef72a360db3cf4,Electronic journal of statistics,7 1,"

Toll-like (TLR) receptor genetic variants have been implicated in bacterial vaginosis (BV). We determined whether TLR variants are associated with fastidious BV-associated microbes that are linked with infertility following pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).


METHOD OF STUDY
Sneathia spp., Atopobium vaginae, BVAB1, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were measured in 250 women from the PID Evaluation and Clinical Health (PEACH) study. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated adjusting for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Principal component analysis was used to adjust for population stratification. A false discovery rate q-value of 0.05 was significant.


RESULTS
TLR2-1733C>A (PÂ =Â .003) and TLR2-616A>G (PÂ =Â .004) were associated with cervical A.Â vaginae. TLR2-1733C>A and TLR6-438C>T were associated with A.Â vaginae detection in the endometrium, but this was not significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons (FDR q-valueÂ =Â 0.06).


CONCLUSION
Host gene variants in TLR2 signaling pathways were modestly associated with cervical A.Â vaginae in women with clinical PID.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Brandie D Taylor"", ids = ""3935948""); list(name = ""Patricia A.

4a3be040dbdb5b4732a99b5a8725a060855c4720,Quantitative Tagless Copurification: A Method to Validate and Identify Protein-Protein Interactions*,"Identifying protein-protein interactions (PPIs) at an acceptable false discovery rate (FDR) is challenging. Previously we identified several hundred PPIs from affinity purification - mass spectrometry (AP-MS) data for the bacteria Escherichia coli and Desulfovibrio vulgaris These two interactomes have lower FDRs than any of the nine interactomes proposed previously for bacteria and are more enriched in PPIs validated by other data than the nine earlier interactomes. To more thoroughly determine the accuracy of ours or other interactomes and to discover further PPIs de novo, here we present a quantitative tagless method that employs iTRAQ MS to measure the copurification of endogenous proteins through orthogonal chromatography steps. 5273 fractions from a four-step fractionation of a D. vulgaris protein extract were assayed, resulting in the detection of 1242 proteins. Protein partners from our D. vulgaris and E. coli AP-MS interactomes copurify as frequently as pairs belonging to three benchmark data sets of well-characterized PPIs. In contrast, the protein pairs from the nine other bacterial interactomes copurify two- to 20-fold less often. We also identify 200 high confidence D. vulgaris PPIs based on tagless copurification and colocalization in the genome. These PPIs are as strongly validated by other data as our AP-MS interactomes and overlap with our AP-MS interactome for D.vulgaris within 3% of expectation, once FDRs and false negative rates are taken into account. Finally, we reanalyzed data from two quantitative tagless screens of human cell extracts. We estimate that the novel PPIs reported in these studies have an FDR of at least 85% and find that less than 7% of the novel PPIs identified in each screen overlap. Our results establish that a quantitative tagless method can be used to validate and identify PPIs, but that such data must be analyzed carefully to minimize the FDR.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Maxim Shatsky"", ids = ""47493734""); list(name = ""Ming Wang Dong"", ids = ""47308341""); list(name = ""Haichuan Liu"", ids = ""1822011""); list(name = ""Lee Lisheng Yang"", ids = ""31168696""); list(name = ""Megan W Choi"", ids = ""6944346""); list(name = ""Mary E.

4af86feb17671a90eaa261a37b41ac5178941986,High-accuracy identification and bioinformatic analysis of in vivo protein phosphorylation sites in yeast.,"Protein phosphorylation is a fundamental regulatory mechanism that affects many cell signaling processes. Using high-accuracy MS and stable isotope labeling in cell culture-labeling, we provide a global view of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphoproteome, containing 3620 phosphorylation sites mapped to 1118 proteins, representatively covering the yeast kinome and a multitude of transcription factors. We show that a single false discovery rate for all peptide identifications significantly overestimates occurrence of rare modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation in yeast. The identified phosphorylation sites are predominantly located on irregularly structured and accessible protein regions. We found high evolutionary conservation of phosphorylated proteins and a large overlap of significantly over-represented motifs with the human phosphoproteome. Nevertheless, phosphorylation events at the site level were not highly conserved between yeast and higher eukaryotes, which points to metazoan-specific kinase and substrate families. We constructed a yeast-specific phosphorylation sites predictor on the basis of a support vector machine, which - together with the yeast phosphorylation data - is integrated into the PHOSIDA database (www.phosida.com).",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Florian Gnad"", ids = ""2549917""); list(name = ""Lyris M de Godoy"", ids = ""3968084""); list(name = ""Juergen Cox"", ids = ""47582418""); list(name = ""Nadin Neuhauser"", ids = ""6502029""); list(name = ""Shubin Ren"", ids = ""3301890""); list(name = ""Jesper V.

878be1a9fd112aafa5e57900d374e4b359901211,Mo1534 Association Between Telomere Length and Risk of Cirrhosis in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B,"Background and Aim: To screen differentially expressed genes and MicroRNAs hoping bring us a new target spot to accurate diagnosis and effective therapy in gene and MicroRNA level of alcoholic liver disease(ALD).Methods: The total RNA of peripheral blood was extracted from four groups of three subjects.And all patients signed the informed consents. Microarrays were utilized to detect differentially expressed genes and MicroRNAs. According to gene values, significance level (p values) and false discovery rate with a random variance model, combining the GO and KEGG database, node genes and key MicroRNAs in network were obtained and analyzed.Results: A total of 878 differentially expressed genes and 26 MicroRNAs were discovered. Not all of these genes have biological effects on the development of ALD. By combining the gene ontology (GO) database and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, 16 significantly different pathways were found, where 31 corresponding genes participated in.Calculating betweenness centrality of each gene in network, which can describe the degree of importance of the nodes in the whole net. In co-expression network of genes, the node genes modulating the network were ACSF3, FZD5, LOC727987 and C1orf222. And in MicroRNA-Gene network the key MicroRNAs were hsa-miR-570, hsa-miR-122, hsa-miR-34b, hsa-miR-29c, hsa-miR-922 and hsa-miR-185 they negatively regulated about 79 genes locate their downstream.Conclusions: In the course of the ALD, we found 4 differentially expressed node genes in network and analyzed Acyl-coenzyme A synthetase-3 (ACSF3) , the maximal betweenness centrality in the entire gene-modulating network was 0.102935, indicating its controlling capability and significance level. Continuous up-regulation of ACSF3 maintains transcriptional activation and subsequently strengthens the binding of ACSF3 to thioester and CoA to activate fatty acids, which results in the irreversible advancement of ALD from hepatitis to cirrhosis. The gene values of Frizzled-5(FZD5) in alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis were clearly downregulated. The second highest value of betweenness centrality in the entire gene-modulating network was 0.087. A possible mechanism may be that continuous down-regulation of FZD5 during advancement of alcoholic hepatitis to cirrhosis decreased gene activities and syntheses of multi-transmembrane transport proteins. This reduced the number of Î²-catenin molecules in hepatocytes and therefore promoted hepatocyte apoptosis. The other two genes' functions were unknown. And the 6 key MicroRNAs perhaps controlled numerous biology functions such as immune response, activity of cancer gene, inflammatory mediated response, cell cycle, glutathione metabolism. Maybe the discovery will provide valuable directions to diagnosis and treatment of ALD.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jennifer S.

Background: Alterations in DNA copy number can functionally affect genes and produce a transformed cancer phenotype. Discoevery of novel cancer genes can be facilitated by identifying genomic regions undergoing frequent, significant alteration. Array comparative genomic hybridization techniques have generated vast amounts of raw copy number data requiring computational analysis to identify aberrations likely to be functional. In this analysis, we present data from a comprehensive computational approach designed to robustly map chromosomal aberrations in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC).

Methods: DNA was extracted from 31 microdissected OCSCC frozen tumors and hybridized with reference DNA on the Agilent 1M copy number array, containing nearly 1 million probes across the genome at high resolution. The RAE computational framework was used to identify CNAs. In this analysis, segmentation of probe data is first performed using paired reference HapMap data and individual-tumor thresholds to account for stromal admixture and tumor heterogeneity. Scores (single-copy gain, amplification, hemizygous loss, homozygous deletion) are then assigned, followed by soft discrimination thresholding and significance testing with false discovery rate correction. Regions of interest (ROIs) are then agnostically identified as regions of significant (FDR<0.01) alteration, expanded to adjacent loci to account for spatial and amplitude uncertainty. Finally, described copy number polymorphisms were excluded.

Results: 49 ROIs were identified, 27 amplification regions (chromosomes 3,4,5,7,8,9,11,16,18,20,21) and 22 deletion regions (chromosomes 2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,13,15,16,18,19). ROIs ranged in prevalence from 6.5-77.4% of samples, and encompassed 0-483 genes (total=2799, median=4), and 0-13 microRNAs (total=77, median=0). Eleven ROIs were focal intragenic CNAs. Four ROIs contained no named genes or microRNAs. Hierarchical clustering identified 3 clusters, based on escalating levels of CNA. Complete gene details of the 49 ROIs will be presented.

Conclusions: We report significant regions of CNA in oral cancer, by applying a robust computational framework to identify recurrent chromosomal aberrations in OCSCC, which represent highly significant candidate functional events.

The purpose of this study was to use near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to investigate the influence of DUP on brain function using two verbal fluency tests (VFTs) in patients with first-episode SZ (FES). A total of 28 FES patients and 29 healthy controls (HC) underwent NIRS during VFTs. Group comparisons of cortical activity were made using two-tailed t-tests and the false discovery rate method. We then examined the associations between DUP and hemodynamic changes in each channel to identify any effects of DUP on brain cortical activity. During the letter VFT, the HC group exhibited significantly greater cortical activations over bilateral frontotemporal regions compared to FES patients. However, this distinction was not observed while performing a category version of the VFT. In addition, no associations between DUP and brain cortical activity were observed in the FES group during either VFT. In conclusion, we did not find an association between DUP and frontotemporal cortical activities. This might be because neurodevelopmental disturbances result in neurocognitive deficits long before psychotic symptoms onset.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Po-Han Chou"", ids = ""145431857""); list(name = ""Wei-Hao Lin"", ids = ""2472161""); list(name = ""Chih-Chien Lin"", ids = ""49044461""); list(name = ""Po-Hsun Hou"", ids = ""120406325""); list(name = ""Wan-Rung Li"", ids = ""4536688""); list(name = ""Chia-Chun Hung"", ids = ""46658444""); list(name = ""Ching-Po Lin"", ids = ""123260716""); list(name = ""Tsuo-Hung Lan"", ids = ""121507424""); list(name = ""C S Chan"", ids = ""120806975"")",2c9df026ac253bc332234c25f1ea2f5feb0b8fa9; 2ff7bdf9457b608de074d1e3623785a95178f1e8; 4e72117988d6d02d6153d12b323b46722fa40b31; 3555a21b0794c8592a88bb8e2ea40df536c23e3c; ef56d8a682ffc2d0c964a7e277d3a9a88762bd07,,Scientific Reports,5,

Here, we describe a genome-wide association study in 676 EGPA cases and 6809 controls, that identifies 4 EGPA-associated loci through conventional case-control analysis, and 4 additional associations through a conditional false discovery rate approach. Many variants are also associated with asthma and six are associated with eosinophil count in the general population. Through Mendelian randomisation, we show that a primary tendency to eosinophilia contributes to EGPA susceptibility. Stratification by ANCA reveals that EGPA comprises two genetically and clinically distinct syndromes. MPO+â€‰ANCA EGPA is an eosinophilic autoimmune disease sharing certain clinical features and an HLA-DQ association with MPO+â€‰ANCA-associated vasculitis, while ANCA-negative EGPA may instead have a mucosal/barrier dysfunction origin. Four candidate genes are targets of therapies in development, supporting their exploration in EGPA. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare inflammatory disorder characterised by asthma, eosinophilia and vasculitis.

4e9680c71cd4d522117c40e45f66ac57d560aee2,Filtering genes to improve sensitivity in oligonucleotide microarray data analysis,"Many recent microarrays hold an enormous number of probe sets, thus raising many practical and theoretical problems in controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Biologically, it is likely that most probe sets are associated with un-expressed genes, so the measured values are simply noise due to non-specific binding; also many probe sets are associated with non-differentially-expressed (non-DE) genes. In an analysis to find DE genes, these probe sets contribute to the false discoveries, so it is desirable to filter out these probe sets prior to analysis. In the methodology proposed here, we first fit a robust linear model for probe-level Affymetrix data that accounts for probe and array effects. We then develop a novel procedure called FLUSH (Filtering Likely Uninformative Sets of Hybridizations), which excludes probe sets that have statistically small array-effects or large residual variance. This filtering procedure was evaluated on a publicly available data set from a controlled spiked-in experiment, as well as on a real experimental data set of a mouse model for retinal degeneration. In both cases, FLUSH filtering improves the sensitivity in the detection of DE genes compared to analyses using unfiltered, presence-filtered, intensity-filtered and variance-filtered data. A freely-available package called FLUSH implements the procedures and graphical displays described in the article.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Stefano Calza"", ids = ""50050777""); list(name = ""Wolfgang Raffelsberger"", ids = ""2011105""); list(name = ""Alexander Ploner"", ids = ""47353253""); list(name = ""JosÃ© Alain Sahel"", ids = ""143632884""); list(name = ""Thierry LÃ©veillard"", ids = ""2332808""); list(name = ""Yudi Pawitan"", ids = ""48384480"")",02105e7316355ee9898f03d08628c3d56364e773; 160fc69d640de616a487c967a0bc5583729aa70d; 781923feea1708115fb144f4746b10ff98d61341; 8f414c71c405ad6a08940517903a1b89ae2c2803; 079c268a8a2b90eedae1fbeae9280cb7ccb2092e; 739a547977532e33580c7f6b5b87705c977ba414; f93eb8d664cba64b3196046cf3cd6bead611b806; e84ab75ef4d5ce732dafa9876df1245f70493186; 61fbc8c8809ddc42f8c284ace9eb93ffddb64bec; 7056fc8b2f5304680b66113559e03732ea8cf8e8; b471232c8ca21cda8460e9d3a40b5505a7de9af1; 3c651a9c19ec407ea3d696b9cc9f30d833e02f18; 781acb48a8d78e0ca53b65c9dd91a71f241b9186; 176026081a83e147140cb095d73208991331c2e0; 57acb91d43339480c7acc183547cf2cada1920a7; 77a134313f1f73d098f816d1ac455f434b31ce73; 365359316b03931e30a03f1d3835c8be0a16ff44; 342ab04fc71761e97d211528f934bb541705216f; 9deb0dcad2ae9a1b6ff78f0801457b764a64d624; 80bff629644c11bbcf5ed8388cc0a70e8443efc2; aa51194008b4777dab5d186595a1afeafda896f7; 17bec42564d4d9f69606a909ee2715c64b18741b; 76f15600c2b05e039c8fcd3e9942a4c686236d20; 2703539eb7f55346fcbb44fa0378967c06fe3c28; 8b19c40d59f0b767606d696bc2fc716047e4b888; e0d2c03d53d9619933b2c71dd00df3074d254983; b83da1c082d0333d4042fba631e672bd1020ede5; b82f6f2de487d6b67efc760e80dfa563666109c7; fe540fa317b56355b7a7116335b013c5d9525f37; 350509bbe2d3aa83088333f9c40d59afc963d9c0; c26090ba0a64ac38112016d6088b60065f0f7764; 85a3d61a1b3120f08a42f1a8bd2ab24ab78708f4; 2e79dc466d6d7e0095561eb5869797002256f262; ccc5fdd338859e16bedc7d61190ee039ccef45d4; 4227892e60071c1ac6e785ee451565633a23946b; 00121cc17f4aafa4b90233e4a96525f647a21a50,d80524e98d1283aff8e4210adbd20844e49a544c; 7772a2c4227577c244009f25e950c1d1f2504060; 331c7fc85c9f54c1f97c34ade070546d88ce497d; ea1d24518950433b9dbfa563b888f3585b044751; b8608bff54e1cc933eead9e40c725d7933a567ff; 0d2e41e19d36e0456f5bdad0113f43e78182f01d; f4af7cb8d6a648aab0c11cf689ec9f83ee7922b2; 195ec526820e21d4ff9ef914ff593c26ac340838; bfbd97872d955301d65bda4e9fe61ef8b3038d46; 488be46a08ec341769e09527cfbfaf4968cbca65; 3b8dc854a75e5622482e60cb7d8c12702455956e; 38d3d59643b4dd5a573fba1cc993fa19d58b44f3; 0165a1fcf0a68016d4d7b87670185d8e0d7ad488; 0f3f73e0e52a2346c3130d11c96f17f572a103f6; a52d86fe76c13610b469750b5b327218a1a5b2cf; 215f7d8598c0c804a79bcde371f836cd540a11fb; 83e6ee4e808db76cb939dc93e7f2d787e5de24c2; fd4b45dcbdca97567ef0b0a085824a5044d884d4; d28eec5e4a17994c046c29e82579c448b378e52c; 95124346ee368ebdf57e003b1fa6a656beda0344; 545bc7be5b9cb6b3cfd18e6fd1c233401582685a; e7e6469da5af016860ade0587e5858a2691f8d57; 89f4a8ed61c1af384c895984ece7f07148747fdf; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; 47aa43276291e50f0b0ea7487045bee59d77ceaa; 4363343ebbca657cc9b71a7de17717e8aad5b6dc; e6a2ee9d2b748af0fa1bfc90c771c63702a10448; 2105e119ada66b467abf8844cf4fd3d9893a14e4; c3e75bd668334c7697ba73a991fdfe74dfd81a9f; c68641ecb311f6febe87bf92fb7988a77e3dc2c9; 272da24e76e492afd62a64552a4fdc56ac6fb1b3; ed0f4dab7375de873fbd4e12fd5637c6b284813e; 698dc65d87654842e895733442ea83b8a35070c9; fef0cc84eb8f08e00d0c718bcc700dbb04633588; 03e1829f810f761dee004b1dcf8a8fc1031e7660; 58f47fe7cb59fa94cdd7014e395b52b833a4490e,Nucleic Acids Research,35,e102 - e102
3471178afc5c3e14216ead987d0b401efb4d54c2,Differential Gene Expression Associated with Meningeal Injury in Acute Mild Traumatic Brain Injury,"Abstract Injury to the meninges is not uncommon after traumatic brain injury (TBI), yet minimal research has been directed toward understanding the relevant biology. After a concussive event, the meninges are observed to abnormally enhance on post-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in some patients, but not all. The aim of this work is to identify genes differentially expressed in patients with meningeal injury. Patients presenting to the emergency room with suspected TBI received a standard research MRI and blood draw within 48â€‰h of injury. Two groups of patients were included: those with and without abnormal enhancement of the meninges on post-contrast MRI, both without other imaging findings. Groups were compared on microarray gene expression in peripheral blood samples using Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) and Partek Genomics Suite (Partek, Inc., St. Louis, MO) software (false discovery rate, <0.05). Forty patients were enrolled with a time from injury to MRI/blood draw of 16.8â€‰h (interquartile ra...",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""S LivingstonWhitney"", ids = ""1432604210""); list(name = ""M GillJessica"", ids = ""1432603313""); list(name = ""R CotaMartin"", ids = ""101119781""); list(name = ""OliveraAnlys"", ids = ""1432604280""); list(name = ""L O'KeefeJessica"", ids = ""1432604069""); list(name = ""MartinChristiana"", ids = ""1432603573""); list(name = ""L LatourLawrence"", ids = ""100761791"")",,,Journal of Neurotrauma,,

The study also aimed to use these SNPs to develop prediction models for individual training responses.Methods79 Healthy volunteers participated in the HIT program. A genome-wide association study, based on 2,391,739 SNPs, was performed to identify SNPs that were significantly associated with gains in VÊ¹O2max and knee peak torque, following 9Â weeks of the HIT program. To predict two training responses, two independent SNPs sets were determined using linear regression and iterative binary logistic regression analysis. False discovery rate analysis and permutation tests were performed to avoid false-positive findings.ResultsTo predict gains in VÊ¹O2max, 7 SNPs were identified. These SNPs accounted for 26.0Â % of the variance in the increment of VÊ¹O2max, and discriminated the subjects into three subgroups, non-responders, medium responders, and high responders, with prediction accuracy of 86.1Â %. For the knee peak torque, 6 SNPs were identified, and accounted for 27.5Â % of the variance in the increment of knee peak torque. The prediction accuracy discriminating the subjects into the three subgroups was estimated as 77.2Â %.ConclusionsNovel SNPs found in this study could explain, and predict inter-individual variability in gains of VÊ¹O2max, and knee peak torque.

cbb6ef162bfedde3f75543eb1a4f6ec3fabede4a,Decision theory results for one-sided multiple comparison procedures,"A resurgence of interest in multiple hypothesis testing has occurred in the last decade. Motivated by studies in genomics, microarrays, DNA sequencing, drug screening, clinical trials, bioassays, education and psychology, statisticians have been devoting considerable research energy in an effort to properly analyze multiple endpoint data. In response to new applications, new criteria and new methodology, many ad hoc procedures have emerged. The classical requirement has been to use procedures which control the strong familywise error rate (FWE) at some predetermined level a. That is, the probability of any false rejection of a true null hypothesis should be less than or equal to a. Finding desirable and powerful multiple test procedures is difficult under this requirement. One of the more recent ideas is concerned with controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), that is, the expected proportion of rejected hypotheses which are, in fact, true. Many multiple test procedures do control the FDR. A much earlier approach to multiple testing was formulated by Lehmann [Ann. Math. Statist. 23 (1952) 541-552 and 28 (1957) 1-25]. Lehmann's approach is decision theoretic and he treats the multiple endpoints problem as a 2 k finite action problem when there are k endpoints. This approach is appealing since unlike the FWE and FDR criteria, the finite action approach pays attention to false acceptances as well as false rejections. In this paper we view the multiple endpoints problem as a 2 k finite action problem. We study the popular procedures single-step, step-down and step-up from the point of view of admissibility, Bayes and limit of Bayes properties. For our model, which is a prototypical one, and our loss function, we are able to demonstrate the following results under some fairly general conditions to be specified: (i) The single-step procedure is admissible. (ii) A sequence of prior distributions is given for which the step-down procedure is a limit of a sequence of Bayes procedures. (iii) For a vector risk function, where each component is the risk for an individual testing problem, various admissibility and inadmissibility results are obtained. In a companion paper [Cohen and Sackrowitz, Ann. Statist. 33 (2005) 145-158], we are able to give a characterization of Bayes procedures and their limits.

c940923db7493f055e66beb1265466e92e49b465,Analisi dell'immuno-trascrittoma di cavallo nelle patologie IAD e RAO,"The research project has been developed on the equine inflammatory respiratory diseases, which can be divided in Recurrent Airway Obstruction (RAO) and Inflammatory Airway Disease (IAD). The aim of this study was to investigate immune-related genes expression in the respiratory tract of IAD and RAO-affected horses. Clinical examination and endoscopy were performed. On the Broncho-Alveolar Lavage (BAL) fluid, obtained during endoscopy, cytological and microbiological analysis were performed to evaluate correlations between the gene expressions values and the clinical parameters. 
A first analysis was developed by real time RT-PCR comparing the gene expression profile of 10 immune-related target genes (IL-1s, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, IL-17, TNFa, INF?, TGF-s1, NF?-s and TRL 4) in the BAL of healthy horses and RAO-affected ones, on which sampling was performed twice within 15 days. The aim was to deepen the effects of the respiratory disease on the equine immune system and to assess a potential temporal evolution of the gene expression values and of the other parameters considered. In addition, biopsies of the bronchial tissue were obtained and subsequent, histological evaluation and gene expression analyses were performed. Six of the target genes showed a significant expression values increase in the RAO group compared to the control one. A positive statistical correlation between the amount of mucus in the airways and the expression of some genes investigated was found. Regarding inflammatory mediators expression in the biopsy tissue, neither of target genes was significantly differentially expressed between the RAO horses and the control group. 
The second part of the research project included also the study of IAD. On all horses, clinical investigations and assessments of gene expression profiles were carried out twice within 15 days, at the diagnosis moment and at the end of the pharmacological treatment. Considering the results of the first study, no biopsies of the respiratory tissue were performed. The development of a microarray platform specific for equine immune-related genes, provide a global view of the pathways involved in the IAD and RAO inflammatory response. The statistical analyses showed that 379 transcripts (55 up-regulated and 324 down-regulated) were significantly differentially expressed between the IAD group and control horses and 1763 genes (903 up-regulated and 860 down-regulated) between the RAO-affected horses and the healthy animals. Between IAD-affected horses and RAO animals, were showed significant differences of the respiratory rate at rest and of the amount of mucus in the airways. Some transcripts involved in the genesis, length and motility of the respiratory epithelium cilia, were down-regulated both in IAD and in RAO horses. In the IAD population, has been demonstrated the over-expression of genes coding for inflammatory mediators. Some of the transcripts up-regulated in the RAO group, are involved in the inflammatory response, bronchoconstriction, apoptosis and hypoxia pathway. In the same disease, some genes involved in the genesis of the protective muco-protein film of the respiratory epithelium were under-expressed. The analyses carried out by the software Gene Sets Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that the pathway activated during human asthma, is also enriched in equine RAO, albeit marginally significant (False Discovery Rate <25%, p value 0.08 ). The low quality of the RNA extracted from the BAL of some samples, did not allow to reach a significant number of horses, considered before and after the pharmacological treatment, to assess the effect of the therapy on gene expression profiles. 
In conclusion, the present studies provided information about the immunological mechanisms activated during the most important equine respiratory diseases. 
In the future, the information obtained could lead to the development of new therapies for IAD and RAO, by the inhibition of molecules involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases, as is already done in human medicine. 
The involvement of the same pathway in human asthma and equine RAO, could suggest a possible role of horses as animal model for the study of human chronic respiratory diseases.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Elisa Padoan"", ids = ""48972512"")",,,,,
9fd0c98826dab5c6971827725f4ac4094f48f5af,Analysis of crucial molecules involved in herniated discs and degenerative disc disease,"OBJECTIVES
Herniated discs and degenerative disc disease are major health problems worldwide. However, their pathogenesis remains obscure. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of these ailments and to identify underlying therapeutic targets.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Using the GSE23130 microarray datasets downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, differentially co-expressed genes and links were identified using the differentially co-expressed gene and link method with a false discovery rate ,0.25 as a significant threshold. Subsequently, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the differential co-expression of these genes were investigated using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis. In addition, the transcriptional regulatory relationship was also investigated.


RESULTS
Through the analysis of the gene expression profiles of different specimens from patients with these diseases, 539 differentially co-expressed genes were identified for these ailments. The ten most significant signaling pathways involving the differentially co-expressed genes were identified by enrichment analysis. Among these pathways, apoptosis and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction pathways have been reported to be related to these diseases. A total of 62 pairs of regulatory relationships between transcription factors and their target genes were identified as critical for the pathogenesis of these diseases.


CONCLUSION
The results of our study will help to identify the mechanisms responsible for herniated discs and degenerative disc disease and provides a theoretical basis for further therapeutic study.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhigang Qu"", ids = ""4142661""); list(name = ""Weiwei Miao"", ids = ""48687990""); list(name = ""Qi Zhang"", ids = ""144056240""); list(name = ""Zhenyu Wang"", ids = ""50218148""); list(name = ""Changfeng Fu"", ids = ""4503431""); list(name = ""Jinhua Han"", ids = ""4017381""); list(name = ""Yi Liu"", ids = ""49420655"")",6677ba1582e572b308162590debefe038a3e5bd2,6a1d8edee51046a9b4ba2f64c0358a891d7b5369; bcd9daa9e772769c7414b5c85fa5058935c15091; 09abf1e9b4924835c3fcc1bc88bc6ca28edfd7c4; 25ff8392ef000a2cebb19e27d3d313ace815bc72; cd5a14913d914c2e1d009f421602eb65714673df; 4a20823dd4ce6003e31f7d4e0649fe8c719926f2; 687acaf47e22d15ef8b48def3d37614f0db18662; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; aec58dd1363d679e9e1d7917d74c0bcde504b65f; 7f6d3f061d78ea7efdc3e4d081ad8f4843700fcf; ac93b5e35112d468b35e4cbafb14cca1d6943906; d8664772cd74c31165e4345b0941f17045c32dc9; ba93b2d1e73b1fe3bb97bf2f49eca67adc2e981a; 891ed519131d028ca230541d210a7c439cfe7d56; d63db3999518d56a8a92129c3a68b95eb7d21091; 792c010ec8200d89b4084d1bc286f515c2e3fab5; 8c8902aefbb004c5b496780f6dfd810a91d30dce; 5f9a4b5157c43f88ad1cac312fffc8c4fd365fae; 9b8601935fb4c3bf78cb7e34e2e7159f8e7addf2; b5220aa0e629a4d688abd05e8de40c79f6245026; 64693bcd43bc3a9fe47e5172435eda307073de12; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; 5b126d1ef33f4b39b2f37dd5d97cd30b3658c5d6; 18760439d1afc28d8873a8c1f7f8516ca822ea1f; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 0ec94c324297baaf3a69a8c0602834060767d880; ef8161b95ba86b2644b56bfffa54f0926843376a; 9965f9869d39d1375cf8d6329ea08001f579e973; d267d099307d3e72ae806f293ea444aca6ec122a; a8d8ef8e762d2c4f8b58866f0bcbae2513ceef4f; 0fc1634b8be6f56df8e5295d550960e4dc4f5d07,Clinics,68,225 - 229
5422cf970fa5b7e3db14637cb40c7a1c807a6d28,"Gene expression alterations in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues.","BACKGROUND AND AIM
Widespread applicability of tissue-based mRNA expression screening for Barrett esophagus (BE) is likely to require (1) accurate methods for assaying archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) histopathology specimens taken at endoscopy, and (2) validation studies of promising biomarkers in different patient cohorts.


RESULTS
30 genes were significantly differentially expressed by histopathology tissue type. The direction and magnitude of the differences were very similar to those found in previous studies using fresh frozen tissues. Novel upregulated genes were TSPAN8 (also known as CO-029), TSPAN24 (CD151), EGR1 and TCIRG1. Novel downregulated genes were DPYD, TSPAN29 (CD9) and Ets1. Strong associations between histopathology type and gene expression were observed with the overexpressed genes: cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), for which histopathology type explained 77.7% of the variation in expression, TSPAN1 (73.5%), TSPAN8 (62.9%), SPARC (62.1%), MMP7 (50.8%); and the under-expressed genes ADH7 (53.7%), APC (58.2%), RAR-gamma (51.3%).


METHODS
mRNA was isolated from 54 FFPE small endoscopic biopsies from patients with Barrett intestinal metaplasia (BE), esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), or control patients with a normal squamous-lined esophagus. Multiplexed tandem PCR (MT-PCR) was used to quantitate 50 selected candidate genes for BE and control genes in duplicate. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to explore the presence of global differences in gene expression profiles. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the transformed data was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed between different histological subtypes. Differentially expressed genes with a fold change of â‰¥2 (upregulated) or â‰¤-2 (downregulated) are reported with the p value for each comparison (EAC vs. normal, EAC vs. BE and BE vs. normal). The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to control the false discovery rate at 0.01 for all comparisons.


CONCLUSIONS
Alterations in expression of select genes are strongly associated with BE or EAC or both. This study's findings for many highly differentially expressed genes are very similar to those previously reported, suggesting that these genes should be tested further in longitudinal studies for their potential role as biomarkers of progression to more advanced Barrett disease.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Natalia K.

f8e8683678e91049c5638d65bba11489c06ac2af,Proteomic modulation in breast tumors after metformin exposure: results from a â€œwindow of opportunityâ€ trial,"PurposeReverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) is a high-throughput antibody-based technique to assess cellular protein activity. The goal of this study was to assess protein marker changes by RPPA in tumor tissue from a pre-surgical metformin trial in women with operable breast cancer (BC).MethodsIn an open-label trial, metformin 1500-mg PO daily was administered prior to resection in 35 non-diabetic patients with stage 0â€“III BC, body mass index â‰¥25Â kg/m2. For RPPA, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples were probed with 160 antibodies. Paired and two-sample t-tests were performed (pÂ â‰¤Â 0.05). Multiple comparisons were adjusted for by fixing the false discovery rate at 25Â %. We evaluated whether pre- and post-metformin changes of select markers by RPPA were identified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in these samples. We also assessed for these changes by western blot in metformin-treated BC cell lines.ResultsAfter adjusting for multiple comparisons in the 32 tumors from metformin-treated patients vs. 34 untreated historical controls, 11 proteins were significantly different between cases vs. controls: increases in Raptor, C-Raf, Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1, TRFC, and Syk; and reductions in pMAPKpT202,Y204, JNKpT183,pT185, BadpS112, PKC.alphapS657, and SrcpY416. Cyclin D1 change after metformin by IHC was not observed. In cell lines, reductions in JNKpT183 and BadpS112 were seen, with no change in Cyclin D1 or Raptor.ConclusionsThese results suggest that metformin modulates apoptosis/cell cycle, cell signaling, and invasion/motility. These findings should be assessed in larger metformin trials. If confirmed, associations between these changes and BC clinical outcome should be evaluated.Clinicaltrials.gov identifierNCT00930579.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kevin Kalinsky"", ids = ""6799263""); list(name = ""Tian Zheng"", ids = ""145857622""); list(name = ""Hanina H.

b3777ebecd0661875bad6f0b8ce3158f870432da,Abstract 2960:TRIM29is a novel biomarker for basal-like breast cancer,"Basal-like breast cancer is a subtype of tumors associated with aggressive clinical behavior and poor prognosis. The genes responsible for their aggressive phenotype have not been well characterized and may provide an opportunity for targeted therapies. Tripartite motif-containing 29 (TRIM29) is a member of the TRIM protein family. Microarray and RT-qPCR analyses shows TRIM29 overexpressed in Basal-like breast tumors and it is highly correlated to other basal tumor markers such as CK5/6, CK17, EGFR, and FOXC1. We recently observed using immunohistochemistry that TRIM29 predominantly localizes to the nucleus in basal tumor epithelial cells, in contrast to a cytoplasmic localization seen in ER-positive tumors. Thus, TRIM29 may act as a transcriptional regulatory factor involved in carcinogenesis. In order to investigate the role of TRIM29 in the initiation and progression of Basal-like breast cancer, we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation and massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) to create a genome-wide profile of in vivo TRIM29-binding sites in MDA-MB-468 cells, a human breast cancer cell line. ChIP-seq analysis revealed 94 putative TRIM29 binding regions in the cancer genome of MDA-MB-468 cells with an estimated false discovery rate of less than 5%. One TRIM29 binding motif was found in the TRIM29 binding regions with a core consensus sequence of CTGTCTCC. We also identified some known cancer genes in close proximity to TRIM29 binding sites, including JUND, FBXO31, CCND3, EGFR, and FOXC1. In addition to mapping TRIM29-DNA binding sites, we used co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to identify proteins that interact with TRIM29 in MDA-MB-468 cells. Proteins that co-precipitated with TRIM29 included splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich (SFPQ, a transcriptional co-repressor), poly(A) binding protein (PABPC4); FUS and TAF15 RNA polymerase II (both are proto-oncoproteins and transcriptional activators), and A kinase anchor protein 13 (AKAP13, an adaptor protein involved in protein kinase A signaling pathway). Confirmation of the initial co-IP results was achieved through several independent techniques, including detection of binding partners in TRIM29 precipitates by Western blot and reciprocal co-IP using antibodies to partner proteins and detection of TRIM29 in the precipitates. Overall, results from our studies indicated that besides functioning as a transcription factor, TRIM29 may also participate in signal transduction pathways by forming protein complexes. Our studies have identified new biomarkers for basal-like breast cancers and revealed kinases that could potentially be targeted by biologic therapies.

b11fceba639aa3259d3c1ee87eebd850be922f35,"Altered gene expression profiles in the brain, kidney, and lung of deceased neonatal cloned pigs.","Limited studies have been published analyzing the gene expression patterns of cloned pigs. We compared the expression profiles of brain, kidney, and lung tissues, representing each of the three germ layers, of deceased neonatal cloned pigs with those of age-matched controls using a 13K oligonucleotide microarray. We found 42 (0.7% of total genes analyzed), 178 (2.9%), and 121 (1.9%) genes differentially expressed in the brain, kidney, and lung of clones, respectively, when compared with the corresponding organs from controls (fold change >1.5, pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰=â€‰0.05). These expression aberrations could potentially cause the following pathological anomalies in clones: diabetic nephropathy in the kidney and dysregulated surfactant homeostasis in the lung. Interestingly, upregulated expression of genes belonging to the MAPK pathway was observed in all three organs. To investigate whether the differences in levels of gene expression were caused by differential DNA methylation, the global DNA methylation level was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. In controls, global concentration of methylated cytosine was 5.35%, whereas clones had significantly hypomethylated genomic DNA (4.57%). Bisulfite-pyrosequencing analyses of the promoter regions of differentially expressed candidate genes, c-MYC, Period 1 (PER1), Cathepsin L (CTSL), and Follistatin (FS), however, did not show any differences in the degree of DNA methylation between controls and clones.

b9050f8b14d440b44cadefbb9b89b68653f2e43b,Circulating immune/inflammation markers in Chinese workers occupationally exposed to formaldehyde.,"BACKGROUND
Formaldehyde has been classified as a human myeloid leukemogen. However, the mechanistic basis for this association is still debated.


OBJECTIVES
We aimed to evaluate whether circulating immune/inflammation markers were altered in workers occupationally exposed to formaldehyde.


METHODS
Using a multiplexed bead-based assay, we measured serum levels of 38 immune/inflammation markers in a cross-sectional study of 43 formaldehyde-exposed and 51 unexposed factory workers in Guangdong, China. Linear regression models adjusting for potential confounders were used to compare marker levels in exposed and unexposed workers.


RESULTS
We found significantly lower circulating levels of two markers among exposed factory workers compared with unexposed controls that remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders and multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate of 10%, including chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 11 (36.2 pg/ml in exposed versus 48.4 pg/ml in controls, P = 0.0008) and thymus and activation regulated chemokine (52.7 pg/ml in exposed versus 75.0 pg/ml in controls, P = 0.0028), suggesting immunosuppression among formaldehyde-exposed workers.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings are consistent with recently emerging understanding that immunosuppression might be associated with myeloid diseases. These findings, if replicated in a larger study, may provide insights into the mechanisms by which formaldehyde promotes leukemogenesis.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Jie Seow"", ids = ""3754595""); list(name = ""Luoping Zhang"", ids = ""36466899""); list(name = ""Roel C H Vermeulen"", ids = ""144756664""); list(name = ""Xiaojiang Tang"", ids = ""3692366""); list(name = ""Wei Hu"", ids = ""145066189""); list(name = ""Bryan A Bassig"", ids = ""6660066""); list(name = ""Zhiying Ji"", ids = ""4777143""); list(name = ""Meredith S Shiels"", ids = ""1868764""); list(name = ""Troy J.

34f74f149a2294b4badd9c3902cfebf0ab517166,"Genome-wide association study for behavior, type traits, and muscular development in Charolais beef cattle.","Behavior, type traits, and muscular development are of interest for beef cattle breeding. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) enable the identification of candidate genes, which enables gene-based selection and provides insight in the genetic architecture of these traits. The objective of the current study was to perform a GWAS for 3 behavior traits, 12 type traits, and muscular development in Charolais cattle. Behavior traits, including aggressiveness at parturition, aggressiveness during gestation period, and maternal care, were scored by farmers. Type traits, including udder conformation, teat, feet and legs, and locomotion, were scored by trained classifiers. Data used in the GWAS consisted of 3,274 cows with phenotypic records and genotyping information for 44,930 SNP. When SNP had a false discovery rate (FDR) smaller than 0.05, they were referred to as significant. When SNP had a FDR between 0.05 and 0.20, they were referred to as suggestive. Four significant and 12 suggestive regions were detected for aggressiveness during gestation, maternal care, udder balance, teat thinness, teat length, foot angle, foot depth, and locomotion. These 4 significant and 12 suggestive regions were not supported by other significant SNP in close proximity. No SNP with major effects were detected for behavior and type traits, and SNP associations for these traits were spread across the genome, suggesting that behavior and type traits were influenced by many genes, each explaining a small part of genetic variance. The GWAS identified 1 region on chromosome 2 significantly associated with muscular development, which included the myostatin gene (), which is known to affect muscularity. No other regions associated with muscular development were found. Results showed that the myostatin region associated with muscular development had pleiotropic effects on udder volume, teat thinness, rear leg, and leg angle.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""AmÃ©lie VallÃ©e"", ids = ""50094946""); list(name = ""Jp.

82785bd46bfe1e0e11c773fae9efcc9f25407452,A zero-inflated Poisson model for insertion tolerance analysis of genes based on Tn-seq data,"MOTIVATION
Transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-seq) is an emerging technology that combines transposon mutagenesis with next-generation sequencing technologies for the identification of genes related to bacterial survival. The resulting data from Tn-seq experiments consist of sequence reads mapped to millions of potential transposon insertion sites and a large portion of insertion sites have zero mapped reads. Novel statistical method for Tn-seq data analysis is needed to infer functions of genes on bacterial growth.


RESULTS
In this article, we propose a zero-inflated Poisson model for analyzing the Tn-seq data that are high-dimensional and with an excess of zeros. Maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters are obtained using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and pseudogenes are utilized to construct appropriate statistical tests for the transposon insertion tolerance of normal genes of interest. We propose a multiple testing procedure that categorizes genes into each of the three states, hypo-tolerant, tolerant and hyper-tolerant, while controlling the false discovery rate. We evaluate the proposed method with simulation studies and apply the proposed method to a real Tn-seq data from an experiment that studied the bacterial pathogen, Campylobacter jejuniAvailability and implementation: We provide R code for implementing our proposed method at http://github.com/ffliu/TnSeq A user's guide with example data analysis is also available there.

be80f6196566e75c623fb63e2c66baf7e91afe30,Differences in microRNA expression in breast cancer between women of African and European ancestry,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, characterized by molecularly and phenotypically distinct tumor subtypes, linked to disparate clinical outcomes. American women of African ancestry (AA) are more likely than those of European ancestry (EA) to be diagnosed with aggressive, estrogen receptor negative (ER-) or triple negative breast cancer, and to die of this disease. However, the underlying causes of AA predisposition to ER-/triple negative breast cancer are still largely unknown. In this study, we performed high-throughput whole-genome miRNA expression profiling in breast tissue samples from both AA and EA women. A number of differentially expressed miRNAs, i.e., DEmiRs defined as >2-fold change in expression and false discovery rate <0.05, were identified as up- or downregulated by tumor ER status or by ancestry. We found that among 102 ER-subtype-related DEmiRs identified in breast tumors, the majority of these DEmiRs were race specific, with only 23 DEmiRs shared in tumors from both AAs and EAs; this finding indicates that there are unique subsets of miRNAs differentially expressed between ER- and ER positive tumors within AAs versus EAs. Our overall results support the notion that miRNA expression patterns may differ not only by tumor subtype but by ancestry, indicating differences in tumor biology and heterogeneity of breast cancer between AAs and EAs. These results will provide the basis for further functional analysis to elucidate biological differences between AAs and EAs and to help develop targeted treatment strategies to reduce disparities in breast cancer.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Zhihong Gong"", ids = ""6845194""); list(name = ""Jie Wang"", ids = ""1729576""); list(name = ""Dan Wang"", ids = ""31612060""); list(name = ""Matthew F.

5ad799ba27ed5c96652252b37919f16be8ac4f0a,Analysis of Porcine Transcriptional Response to Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis suggests novel targets of NFkappaB are activated in the Mesenteric Lymph Node,"BackgroundSpecific knowledge of the molecular pathways controlling host-pathogen interactions can increase our understanding of immune response biology as well as provide targets for drug development and genetic improvement of disease resistance. Toward this end, we have characterized the porcine transcriptional response to Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis (S. Choleraesuis), a Salmonella serovar that predominately colonizes swine, yet can cause serious infections in human patients. Affymetrix technology was used to screen for differentially expressed genes in pig mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) responding to infection with S. Choleraesuis at acute (8 hours (h), 24 h and 48 h post-inoculation (pi)) and chronic stages (21 days (d) pi).ResultsAnalysis of variance with false discovery rate control identified 1,853 genes with significant changes in expression level (p-value < 0.01, q-value < 0.26, and fold change (FC) > 2) during infection as compared to un-inoculated control pigs. Down-regulation of translation-related genes at 8 hpi and 24 hpi implied that S. Choleraesuis repressed host protein translation. Genes involved in the Th1, innate immune/inflammation response and apoptosis pathways were induced significantly. However, antigen presentation/dendritic cell (DC) function pathways were not affected significantly during infection. A strong NFÎº B-dependent response was observed, as 58 known NFÎº B target genes were induced at 8, 24 and/or 48 hpi. Quantitative-PCR analyses confirmed the microarray data for 21 of 22 genes tested. Based on expression patterns, these target genes can be classified as an ""Early"" group (induced at either 8 or 24 hpi) and a ""Late"" group (induced only at 48 hpi). Cytokine activity or chemokine activity were enriched within the Early group genes GO annotations, while the Late group was predominantly composed of signal transduction and cell metabolism annotated genes. Regulatory motif analysis of the human orthologous promoters for both Early and Late genes revealed that 241 gene promoters were predicted to contain NFÎº B binding sites, and that of these, 51 Early and 145 Late genes were previously not known to be NFÎº B targets.ConclusionOur study provides novel genome-wide transcriptional profiling data on the porcine response to S. Choleraesuis and expands the understanding of NFÎº B signaling in response to Salmonella infection. Comparison of the magnitude and timing of porcine MLN transcriptional response to different Salmonella serovars, S. Choleraesuis and S. Typhimurium, clearly showed a larger but later transcriptional response to S. Choleraesuis. Both microarray and QPCR data provided evidence of a strong NFÎº B-dependent host transcriptional response during S. Choleraesuis infection. Our data indicate that a lack of strong DC-mediated antigen presentation in the MLN may cause S. Choleraesuis infected pigs to develop a systemic infection, and our analysis predicts nearly 200 novel NFÎº B target genes which may be applicable across mammalian species.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yanfang Wang"", ids = ""38818560""); list(name = ""Oliver Couture"", ids = ""40378478""); list(name = ""Long Qu"", ids = ""50744573""); list(name = ""Jolita J.

Exploring phosphorylation events in testes helps elucidate the specific phosphorylation signals involved in testicular toxicity of PFDoA. Combining efficient prefractionation of tryptic peptide mixtures using self-packed reversed phase C18 columns with TiO2 and IMAC phosphopeptide enrichment techniques followed by 2D-LCâ€“MS/MS, we identified 4077 unique phosphopeptides from 1777 proteins with a false discovery rate below 1.0% in the testes of rats exposed to PFDoA for 110 days. In addition, 937 novel phosphorylation sites were discovered in testicular proteins. Hundreds of phosphorylated proteins identified might be involved in spermatogenesis and sperm function.

Oligonucleotide arrays such as Affymetrix GeneChips use multiple probes, or a probe set, to measure the abundance of mRNA of every gene of interest. Some analysis methods attempt to summarize the multiple observations into one single score before conducting further analysis such as detecting differentially expressed genes (DEG), clustering and classification. However, there is a risk of losing a significant amount of information and consequently reaching inaccurate or even incorrect conclusions during this data reduction.


RESULTS
We developed a novel statistical method called robustified multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) based on the traditional MANOVA model and permutation test to detect DEG for both one-way and two-way cases. It can be extended to detect some special patterns of gene expression through profile analysis across k (>or=2) populations. The method utilizes probe-level data and requires no assumptions about the distribution of the dataset. We also propose a method of estimating the null distribution using quantile normalization in contrast to the 'pooling' method (Section 3.1). Monte Carlo simulation and real data analysis are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method comparing with the 'pooling' method and the usual Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test based on the summarized scores. It is found that the new method successfully detects DEG under desired false discovery rate and is more powerful than the competing method especially when the number of groups is small.

386b0d9046097113eed56f86e3ddadadc64e7969,Association analyses based on false discovery rate implicate new loci for coronary artery disease,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in coronary artery disease (CAD) had identified 66 loci at 'genome-wide significance' (P < 5 Ã— 10âˆ’8) at the time of this analysis, but a much larger number of putative loci at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% (refs. 1,2,3,4). Here we leverage an interim release of UK Biobank (UKBB) data to evaluate the validity of the FDR approach. We tested a CAD phenotype inclusive of angina (SOFT; ncases = 10,801) as well as a stricter definition without angina (HARD; ncases = 6,482) and selected cases with the former phenotype to conduct a meta-analysis using the two most recent CAD GWAS. This approach identified 13 new loci at genome-wide significance, 12 of which were on our previous list of loci meeting the 5% FDR threshold, thus providing strong support that the remaining loci identified by FDR represent genuine signals. The 304 independent variants associated at 5% FDR in this study explain 21.2% of CAD heritability and identify 243 loci that implicate pathways in blood vessel morphogenesis as well as lipid metabolism, nitric oxide signaling and inflammation.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Christopher P.

However, scant research with treated HIV-positive persons has examined stimulant-associated alterations in pathophysiologic processes relevant to HIV pathogenesis. In a sample of 55 HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using sexual minority men with a viral load less than 200â€¯copies/mL, we conducted RNA sequencing to examine patterns of leukocyte gene expression in participants who had a urine sample that was reactive for stimulants (nâ€¯=â€¯27) as compared to those who tested non-reactive (nâ€¯=â€¯28). Results indicated differential expression of 32 genes and perturbation of 168 pathways in recent stimulant users. We observed statistically significant differential expression of single genes previously associated with HIV latency, cell cycle regulation, and immune activation in recent stimulant users (false discovery rate pâ€¯<â€¯0.10). Pathway analyses indicated enrichment for genes associated with inflammation, innate immune activation, neuroendocrine hormone regulation, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Recent stimulant users displayed concurrent elevations in plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor - alpha (TNF-Î±) but not interleukin 6 (IL-6). Further research is needed to examine the bio-behavioral mechanisms whereby stimulant use may contribute to HIV persistence and disease progression.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Adam W.

56e2dbdb24956f2f90bdb3f4ad62da4c1d602d44,Sparse Tensor Graphical Model: Non-convex Optimization and Statistical Inference,"We consider the estimation and inference of sparse graphical models that characterize the dependency structure of high-dimensional tensor-valued data. To facilitate the estimation of the precision matrix corresponding to each way of the tensor, we assume the data follow a tensor normal distribution whose covariance has a Kronecker product structure. A critical challenge in the estimation and inference of this model is the fact that its penalized maximum likelihood estimation involves minimizing a non-convex objective function. To address it, this paper makes two contributions: (i) In spite of the non-convexity of this estimation problem, we prove that an alternating minimization algorithm, which iteratively estimates each sparse precision matrix while fixing the others, attains an estimator with the optimal statistical rate of convergence. Notably, such an estimator achieves estimation consistency with only one tensor sample, which was not observed in the previous work. (ii) We propose a de-biased statistical inference procedure for testing hypotheses on the true support of the sparse precision matrices, and employ it for testing a growing number of hypothesis with false discovery rate (FDR) control. The asymptotic normality of our test statistic and the consistency of FDR control procedure are established. Our theoretical results are further backed up by thorough numerical studies.

791e1a517f6fa42c3f7df0eec9e6fc5e55fff3b7,The landscape of genetic susceptibility correlations among diseases and traits,"Objective
The aim of the study was to comprehensively explore the genetic susceptibility correlations among diseases and traits from large-scale individual genotype data.


Materials and Methods
Based on a knowledge base of genetic variants significantly (Pâ€‰<â€‰5â€‰Ã—â€‰10 -8 ) linked with human phenotypes, genetic risk scores (GRSs) of diseases or traits were calculated for 2504 individuals with whole-genome sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project. Associations between diseases/traits were statistically evaluated by pairwise correlation analysis of GRSs. Overlaps between the genetic susceptibility correlations and disease comorbidity associations from hospital claims data in more than 30 million patients in United States were assessed.


Results
Correlation analysis of GRSs revealed 823 significant correlations among 78 diseases and 89 traits (false discovery rate adjusted P -value or Q -valueâ€‰<â€‰0.01). It is noticeable that GRSs were correlated in 464 associations (56.4%) even if they were combinations of distinct sets of risk variants without chromosomal linkage, suggesting the presence of genetic interactions beyond chromosome position. When 312 significant genetic susceptibility correlations between diseases were compared to nationwide disease comorbidity correlations obtained from data from 32 million Medicare claims in the United States, 108 overlaps (34.6%) were found that had both genetic susceptibility and epidemiologic comorbid correlations.


Conclusion
The study suggests that common genetic background exists between diseases and traits with epidemiologic associations. The GRS correlation approach provides a rich source of candidate associations among diseases and traits from the genetic perspective, warranting further epidemiologic studies.",2017,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jung Hun Ohn"", ids = ""3348708"")",43cca7dc195841fdaa5a77357082a8900e891049; c7feb5d277f381ea52c5fd521aff2619feb5438a; 7829c25954ff4ff315d103b0fa4c9be11ce4e9f2,b963b97a159c96e3775f13829fcfb26bbb38d40f; ca3a55227674e02b3e278cbdadfe386ed92c8fc4; c8ba4c26d6d37c7e4adfa2c030d31c99d9aabdf3; 4720700564f0aa33b8a055f6a830d8809e4335b1; 374c3c11534b503fe6137cfb24fd44bec539fe61; 53a7a77005e93fb884ebad4fb958bc774b97bf9f; bd00643c0a5d7a8771b24b431a5c864c811c2fa1; f2057a21e3032134c6c8cd05cf5b5a45fda7fb18; 75a2b0c56ded1565624307a435637bb991a142a6; d7e2037cf685d4086bf54d7615c37d8e1f57ed42; 88566678193ef44d5a62a8b8371ed9027f353e71; e83575b534e4cc56959c1e2defb39b5c2786ffcd; 052ab4eccd25d5542947259175ee4091a139cb06; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 706b700e475c4b35bd29555b9ba4fe0baccb186d; e0a7891b68a00e43d10275b60103c0658697416a; 14e118455605be206812b2c35fd5d99c5ab44bc5; dc564ab70bf13afc310f56550b191df45c60728f; 2b544cd8f21b9f9ed5aeac8698a972229a13c7b3; 37fd7e9fa47084aed3c7ced8f561547df7efae61; 8ed5b6126c49734f4d261cf389dc1093083360de; 02000366e27b721308d916e7bf1aeee908b7fea5; 3d8f5e5e1399e27a722d656dfe61d95de65ac70f; 57c022340849d9aec22ae7d6eabd61f81a17c90c; 94f00efbf0870a60b6693779d144aa7352f8a369,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,24,921â€“926

dc8850634b9b95adc2b570a28b3f4d9548bb3958,Reconstructing networks of pathways via significance analysis of their intersections,"BackgroundSignificance analysis at single gene level may suffer from the limited number of samples and experimental noise that can severely limit the power of the chosen statistical test. This problem is typically approached by applying post hoc corrections to control the false discovery rate, without taking into account prior biological knowledge. Pathway or gene ontology analysis can provide an alternative way to relax the significance threshold applied to single genes and may lead to a better biological interpretation.ResultsHere we propose a new analysis method based on the study of networks of pathways. These networks are reconstructed considering both the significance of single pathways (network nodes) and the intersection between them (links).We apply this method for the reconstruction of networks of pathways to two gene expression datasets: the first one obtained from a c-Myc rat fibroblast cell line expressing a conditional Myc-estrogen receptor oncoprotein; the second one obtained from the comparison of Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia derived from bone marrow samples.ConclusionOur method extends statistical models that have been recently adopted for the significance analysis of functional groups of genes to infer links between these groups. We show that groups of genes at the interface between different pathways can be considered as relevant even if the pathways they belong to are not significant by themselves.",2008,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Mirko Francesconi"", ids = ""47688293""); list(name = ""Daniel Remondini"", ids = ""1802616""); list(name = ""Nicola Neretti"", ids = ""1783996""); list(name = ""John M.

f4d92dd198242ab022d38e5ef6271640f4b7d242,Abstract 1880: Associations of coffee drinking with systemic immune and inflammatory markers,"Background: Coffee drinking has been inversely associated with mortality as well as cancers of the endometrium, colon, skin and liver. Improved insulin sensitivity and reduced inflammation are among the hypothesized mechanisms by which coffee drinking may affect cancer risk. The association between coffee drinking and systemic levels of immune and inflammatory markers has not been well characterized. Objective: To explore the associations of coffee drinking with levels of a wide range of immune and inflammatory markers. Design: Luminex bead-based assays were used to measure serum levels of 77 immune and inflammatory markers in 1728 older non-Hispanic Whites from three case-control studies nested within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Usual coffee intake was self-reported using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. We used weighted multivariable logistic regression models to examine the associations between coffee drinking and dichotomized marker levels. We conducted statistical trend tests by assigning each coffee category its median value and modeling as a continuous variable. We applied a 20% false discovery rate criterion to the P-values for trend. Results: Ten of the 77 examined markers were nominally associated (P-value Conclusions: Coffee drinking was associated with lower circulating levels of inflammatory markers, which may partially mediate previously observed associations of coffee drinking with lower mortality and morbidity. Validation studies, ideally controlled feeding trials, and prospective studies, such as nested case-control studies, are needed to confirm these associations.

341d450bc2700d202f33f113770650f6a88996af,"Skills, capabilities and inequalities at school entry in a disadvantaged community",Socioeconomic inequalities in childrenâ€™s skills and capabilities begin early in life and can have detrimental effects on future success in school. The present study examined the relationships between school readiness and socioeconomic (SES) inequalities using teacher reports of the Short Early Development Instrument (Janus et al. 2005) in a disadvantaged urban community of Ireland. It specifically examined differences in skills within a low SES community in order to investigate the role of relative disadvantage on childrenâ€™s development. SES differences across multiple domains of school readiness were examined using Monte Carlo permutation tests and seemingly unrelated regression models. The false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) was used to control for multiple hypothesis testing. The results indicated that being from a relatively higher SES background does not act as a protective factor for children residing in a disadvantaged community for the majority of school readiness domains. This implies that the neighbourhood may play a role in childrenâ€™s school readiness skills. These results suggest that school readiness interventions should target all children living in disadvantaged communities as each child may be at risk of poor school readiness.,2012,Psychology,"list(name = ""Orla Doyle"", ids = ""50360801""); list(name = ""Louise McEntee"", ids = ""12579203""); list(name = ""Kelly A.

d9573d1c4a1adaa3e4b783adac34032cd9afafa6,In vivo differences between endothelial transcriptional profiles of coronary and iliac arteries revealed by microarray analysis.,"Endothelial cells (ECs) from different vascular beds display a remarkable heterogeneity in both structure and function. Phenotypic heterogeneity among arterial ECs is particularly relevant to atherosclerosis since the disease occurs predominantly in major arteries, which vary in their atherosusceptibility. To explore EC heterogeneity between typical atheroprone and atheroresistant arteries, we used DNA microarrays to compare gene expression profiles of freshly harvested porcine coronary (CECs) and iliac artery (IECs) ECs. Statistical analysis revealed 51 genes that were differentially expressed in CECs relative to IECs at a false discovery rate of 5%. Seventeen of these genes are known to be involved in atherogenesis. Consistent with coronary arteries being more atherosusceptible, almost all putative atherogenic genes were overexpressed in CECs, whereas all atheroprotective genes were downregulated, relative to IECs. A subset of the identified genes was validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR results suggest that the differences in expression levels between CECs and IECs for the HOXA10 and HOXA9 genes were >100-fold. Gene ontology (GO) and biological pathway analysis revealed a global expression difference between CECs and IECs. Genes in twelve GO categories, including complement immune activation, immunoglobulin-mediated response, and system development, were significantly upregulated in CECs. CECs also overexpressed genes involved in several inflammatory pathways, including the classical pathway of complement activation and the IGF-1-mediated pathway. The in vivo transcriptional differences between CECs and IECs found in this study may provide new insights into the factors responsible for coronary artery atherosusceptibility.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ji Zhang"", ids = ""2674772""); list(name = ""Kelley Ann Burridge"", ids = ""38810727""); list(name = ""Morton H Friedman"", ids = ""49663931"")",cf9636d238535e292894d2aa050529891447a356; 2ba5db62a3d19bd4e7ed739c0ad65c8438463063; 03ff20c0a5c6be240b7e2acc7fb1abeeb7393e8e; b5efda9fae04fa3011675e31a29beaab61a28577; 0c8cf25f54ac0f6ad9c8800d94ba90b35e33e690; 38080cb7c8849a4e615fca278916ad8d174b880f; 7cf2b1baa9b35a60f03ae5ab993fe971aac93367; 118141ea9d3c608b6c2426cfa8e91e46de5b1986; 3f2c56d33f589ecad7b83cfd07d8a7d4ebd1e8a7; 4b6531c533ea2bfcb83fe43157c2f74adb5c1b2c; cc828474c5ccdc223ce3df1f30c0fc60a6ed4de9; 9d2e4ea0705fb5155a4984fe42dce83388589b1c; bd91f9d9286e77a19c43383b6ee06e18077b7ec9; dc9ba3cb52b2ab9a10bf8b778c0956527bebd6a1; fbd0cf597310703200f032f8c8b871fa4ac66e87; 125e4150d731ab255e40f7c1acc0000b418e6dd5; 5bceadcfb341fe4f7e8331c69dca0d9e03d02738; 18fb34cccb5abd7c5b96733dc4c9a3522c93e83d; 4f95936ab4e85b7a4f2c6b10d1e1b7e8f828f0ac; 255e69d36e0d31f0a730075311ffc2da5e954a91; d06e11a3732a8ffd0f8d24146b84e028c71bb816; 540848790eec0df47d5f14d17a14186287deabb5; 0c4b33fc9bf78b15cd216d0d0c5d589f0110fa7e; 65d9cd31a7bc4057531867c80760976bbd28e2e9; e57bb416d196a31c2f02cf01c4f565b50663a727; 66b076278c29d3e3a1cc12af933a713e6925864b,f45135bfc4ec61b5da45743c427ec9b600c6f167; d482c4fb155c90a0cefe7ba801dc259db558a568; 293e49374bc2d304973e9f97ed11773ea19604b5; ab24465b2d0e743006f3eeffb6ab90e10362148e; f3d849ed55cff6008f00c2f7920a49a0bc02ebc7; cd11f846e2b69e172120a39f1da4d54721b1144e; 045fd9bef9dc25722332c5593c8890fc1402fc9b; 546371ba23864f5918d757398cbaedff5c1bfb95; fc5b9a7b4e34b56b979f1f188268b6cb76ace02f; cbedc6c511a8042e4630abcf941606fc9fb03f2f; 6e5ad41911ecee443d7d01b28c6c6459eddcc1a1; 4f0357f577ae4667db6794f40482d98a4ac8f929; a025bde179e6357bae84b008070c85dc594c2d2c; 330df0b2f912dd0a8e44c193374ac8a2e259966c; f8dcfe9ff772d9483db53d8de99eacc11d3c2951; 7d0e69567560ec8eca6219cfc6ccd0de8e744087; 3b2286d985f4c96e476666e48dbbe83ecc7b1f1d; 671c5e703036e88b35c70936653677242ad75090; eac03c41223d8942898f32e445bdeb829398d3dc; 6f0478c8060f7d1ea4856de1e5b9a8390f09b03d; a5471216ea97fa836d59f84cc1ee4e85d669b0f4; 5045093fbe79ec5dd9988e2912e52c6de09d9d73; 0cdf771b93155c26db225ee6993a8a0520d23a5b; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; cc918091cf091d2a4f4a7c93c371de22b420625f; 21299c385f98953989e9a35ae9fc01dd5758063b; 01575de17672d8f648b7920e189217e52e592043; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 01aab9dadf4f44b7951a505b589d79e65b6f1ad8; 4e3c6bfa31ad86d99bf51555699f37831a77444d; de8dd5c82e6d3f41e0585ddc97aa783508764939; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 4ddcc92c4809bf4de951ccb280f212b9e46d41c1; 2b588b189dfc022f5bb4f3c4ac7cd28220a84a2c; a0b3ebb7d84cdada715c66eee8829693c9f9a799; 53991beedcceb846531374313b435fb7d548af51; bc84d81a82eea42625a1496339081d587b5e2854; b68e7bacbb0d91ff9623e5b93008abba405a476a; 14ac0c20adcc42ab31ed80e944bec1d8fd311648; 97e375c7f2ddfcaa5ba09d5a81af76cebbc2ee65; ca01aeb5c8770d1ccc471bc16f426f92fd391e67; e26b2804e4d12e0391893c496d46fdbd832dd1a2; 55fbe2b775a267035f277d8f8ec37b6588480dbd; 3584627b0706d55e553d766abed6adf68ac612b1,American journal of physiology.

We used a novel clustering method based on Laplacian Eigenmaps, a nonlinear dimension reduction method, to analyze microarray data from laser capture microdissected (LCM) cells at the site and developmental stages (days 10.5 to 12.5) of optic fissure closure. Our new method provided greater biological specificity than classical clustering algorithms in terms of identifying more biological processes and functions related to eye development as defined by Gene Ontology at lower false discovery rates. This new methodology builds on the advantages of LCM to isolate pure phenotypic populations within complex tissues and allows improved ability to identify critical gene products expressed at lower copy number. The combination of LCM of embryonic organs, gene expression microarrays, and extracting spatial and temporal co-variations appear to be a powerful approach to understanding the gene regulatory networks that specify mammalian organogenesis.",2010,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Martin Ehler"", ids = ""1845331""); list(name = ""Vinodh N.

772b49c6def09d1d5a467cb0e5942b1cfa23d615,Gray Matter Volume Reduction Is Associated with Cognitive Impairment in Neuromyelitis Optica.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Whether gray matter impairment occurs in neuromyelitis optica is a matter of ongoing debate, and the association of gray matter impairment with cognitive deficits remains largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate gray matter volume reductions and their association with cognitive decline in patients with neuromyelitis optica.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study included 50 patients with neuromyelitis optica and 50 sex-, age-, handedness-, and education-matched healthy subjects who underwent high-resolution structural MR imaging examinations and a battery of cognitive assessments. Gray matter volume and cognitive differences were compared between the 2 groups. The correlations of the regional gray matter volume with cognitive scores and clinical variables were explored in the patients with neuromyelitis optica.


RESULTS
Compared with healthy controls (635.9 Â± 51.18 mL), patients with neuromyelitis optica (602.8 Â± 51.03 mL) had a 5.21% decrease in the mean gray matter volume of the whole brain (P < .001). The significant gray matter volume reduction in neuromyelitis optica affected the frontal and temporal cortices and the right thalamus (false discovery rate correction, P < .05). The regional gray matter volumes in the frontal and temporal cortices were negatively correlated with disease severity in patients with neuromyelitis optica (Alphasim correction, P < .05). Patients with neuromyelitis optica had impairments in memory, information processing speed, and verbal fluency (P < .05), which were correlated with gray matter volume reductions in the medial prefrontal cortex and thalamus (Alphasim correction, P < .05).

Gray matter volume reduction is present in patients with neuromyelitis optica and is associated with cognitive impairment and disease severity in this group.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Q Wang"", ids = ""5984003""); list(name = ""N Zhang"", ids = ""153708867""); list(name = ""Wen Qin"", ids = ""144804484""); list(name = ""Yongli Li"", ids = ""22371416""); list(name = ""Y Fu"", ids = ""80402843""); list(name = ""Tong Li"", ids = ""50289918""); list(name = ""Jing Huey Shao"", ids = ""145407904""); list(name = ""Liu Yang"", ids = ""51115516""); list(name = ""F-D Shi"", ids = ""144298734""); list(name = ""C Yu"", ids = ""82737592"")",ba2498f5816e73ceced720f8daa14234cb1527f4; fa75c3f375fe892e0b5f242b4f416cdbb5c2654c; 16867bbb7a2d4599e912d2c7f7732dc196adf602; 6a83742989d4814b4a7ccbb534c76ebe1ca1dccf; f34f61b84efd401c4a989b85293175b78d571dfa; aca2fa1729e02ec81882c639e160595558d83e50; 53245b83d50638039f58cbce6b73d9438a07c059; 83dc78edb51c9804b82f98a9f21be34f4d134595; 0d4f370c8da728faca780823fdf659b4ba6400df; c0849c2d6e81e1aba8477560887f3c6038f79871; 43bf3b90104cf915875987b0c24ccddf22e35350,,AJNR.

0d89582bacaade7f232de79c5749c8e26240e1de,Statistical Assessment of Crosstalk Enrichment between Gene Groups in Biological Networks,"MOTIVATION
Analyzing groups of functionally coupled genes or proteins in the context of global interaction networks has become an important aspect of bioinformatic investigations. Assessing the statistical significance of crosstalk enrichment between or within groups of genes can be a valuable tool for functional annotation of experimental gene sets.


RESULTS
Here we present CrossTalkZ, a statistical method and software to assess the significance of crosstalk enrichment between pairs of gene or protein groups in large biological networks. We demonstrate that the standard z-score is generally an appropriate and unbiased statistic. We further evaluate the ability of four different methods to reliably recover crosstalk within known biological pathways. We conclude that the methods preserving the second-order topological network properties perform best. Finally, we show how CrossTalkZ can be used to annotate experimental gene sets using known pathway annotations and that its performance at this task is superior to gene enrichment analysis (GEA).


AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION
CrossTalkZ (available at http://sonnhammer.sbc.su.se/download/software/CrossTalkZ/) is implemented in C++, easy to use, fast, accepts various input file formats, and produces a number of statistics.

47c7edf07bb17ec428cb0ff9e9a075a554a6b2fa,fdrMotif: identifying cis-elements by an EM algorithm coupled with false discovery rate control,"MOTIVATION
Most de novo motif identification methods optimize the motif model first and then separately test the statistical significance of the motif score. In the first stage, a motif abundance parameter needs to be specified or modeled. In the second stage, a Z-score or P-value is used as the test statistic. Error rates under multiple comparisons are not fully considered.


METHODOLOGY
We propose a simple but novel approach, fdrMotif, that selects as many binding sites as possible while controlling a user-specified false discovery rate (FDR). Unlike existing iterative methods, fdrMotif combines model optimization [e.g. position weight matrix (PWM)] and significance testing at each step. By monitoring the proportion of binding sites selected in many sets of background sequences, fdrMotif controls the FDR in the original data. The model is then updated using an expectation (E)- and maximization (M)-like procedure. We propose a new normalization procedure in the E-step for updating the model. This process is repeated until either the model converges or the number of iterations exceeds a maximum.


RESULTS
Simulation studies suggest that our normalization procedure assigns larger weights to the binding sites than do two other commonly used normalization procedures. Furthermore, fdrMotif requires only a user-specified FDR and an initial PWM. When tested on 542 high confidence experimental p53 binding loci, fdrMotif identified 569 p53 binding sites in 505 (93.2%) sequences. In comparison, MEME identified more binding sites but in fewer ChIP sequences than fdrMotif. When tested on 500 sets of simulated 'ChIP' sequences with embedded known p53 binding sites, fdrMotif, compared to MEME, has higher sensitivity with similar positive predictive value. Furthermore, fdrMotif is robust to noise: it selected nearly identical binding sites in data adulterated with 50% added background sequences and the unadulterated data. We suggest that fdrMotif represents an improvement over MEME.

b89708ee9a76638abca5b45782f491193d3b6e64,A Unified View of False Discovery Rate Control: Reconciliation of Bayesian and Frequentist Approaches,"This paper explores the intrinsic connections between the Bayesian false discovery rate (FDR) control procedures and their counterpart of frequentist procedures. We attempt to offer a unified view of FDR control within and beyond the setting of testing exchangeable hypotheses. Under the standard two-groups model and the Oracle condition, we show that the Bayesian and the frequentist methods can achieve asymptotically equivalent FDR control at arbitrary levels. Built on this result, we further illustrate that rigorous post-fitting model diagnosis is necessary and effective to ensure robust FDR controls for parametric Bayesian approaches. Additionally, we show that the Bayesian FDR control approaches are coherent and naturally extended to the setting beyond testing exchangeable hypotheses. Particularly, we illustrate that $p$-values are no longer the natural statistical instruments for optimal frequentist FDR control in testing non-exchangeable hypotheses. Finally, we illustrate that simple numerical recipes motivated by our theoretical results can be effective in examining some key model assumptions commonly assumed in both Bayesian and frequentist procedures (e.g., zero assumption).",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Xiaoquan Wen"", ids = ""36836750"")",a3ebcf57746762779fb95dceba5f8d2c9f01b998,1ee765d218aaea7ef4d95df27043954fb7d3b4df; 3430c978d3484cc18a115205dc4382920f3defb9; 977a61f5b31aef34499caae9da079d79dc1d13a2; 0764085903ccd428636dbce521be068fcef89232; 974bf001626115b669aa92f6851d02accd8b9f00; 840c0cdb1f428d300cd7986d170da5f807b3d20d; 3d727ef56f07ab2406d0aeaaa18e51b932485fc0; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 626b6795c975798a9ba78de9785cb8e7abecfa1f; aecc3b421bf4aff3f1743a2f6cfc865203909474; 3d6751b1be76dbdd0a3e65eb45e973bb8d2c4376; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 7eed0f7f7b128413fdb78ad803c41e65e619715e; eb28f67e71595042f364b99fd06504a3d4c4f823; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; 5752bf8147750d86d74f601f4798bc5822c7afee; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; 03be636697c84eb22114f09de6c1bea215cc87c8; c1dc19f87fa83b4357f0557cbb6c32a4ee0002d7; 6f7c4b5dba6e92339fae4c92ceb81d93c191b4bc,arXiv: Methodology,,

Based on iTRAQ analysis, 3252 proteins are detected in the liver tissues (false discovery rate â‰¤0.01). Thirty-two differently expressed proteins (DEPs) are identified during the three periods by p-value <0.05 and fold change (FC) â‰¥2 or â‰¤0.5, and 183 DEPs based on p-value <0.05 and FC â‰¥1.5 or â‰¤0.67. In addition, 905 DEPs are obtained across the three periods by p-value <0.05 and FC â‰¥1.2, or â‰¤0.83, and the subsequent GO and KEGG pathway functional analysis indicate that 73 DEPs are significantly enriched into the metabolic terms and pathways involved in milk synthesis such as citrate cycle, fatty acid, starch and sucrose metabolism, and mTOR and PPAR signaling pathways. Further, 41 out of 73 DEPs are identified near to both the peak locations of the reported quantitative trait locus and significant single nucleotide polymorphisms that associate with milk yield and composition traits. In addition, the 41 DEPs are analyzed with the previous liver transcriptome data that used the same samples as this study, and considered nine proteins/genes-ALDH18A1, APOA4, CYP7A1, HADHB, PRKACA, IDH2, LDHA, LDHB, and MAT2A-to be the promising candidates for milk fat, protein, and lactose synthesis in dairy cattle.

We focus on how the statistical significance of stratospheric temperature differences may be robustly assessed during years with high and low geomagnetic activity. Two problems must be overcome. The first is the temporal autocorrelation of the data, which is addressed with a correction of the t statistics by means of the estimate of the number of independent values in the series of correlated values. The second is the problem of multiplicity due to strong spatial autocorrelations, which is addressed by means of a false discovery rate (FDR) procedure.

The majority of ALL patients are stratified as Intermediate Risk (IR) and present with moderate levels of minimal residual disease (MRD Methods: Two pairs of IR pediatric ALL patients were matched based on clinical and genetic features, except that one patient from each pair relapsed early while the other remains relapse-free (ALL-Rel and ALL-CR1, respectively). Three parameters were varied in establishing PDXs by inoculating one million bone marrow (BM) derived biopsy cells collected at diagnosis into groups of 4 mice: (1) mouse strain (NOD/SCID vs. NSG); (2) site of inoculation (intravenous vs. intra-femoral); and (3) early treatment of mice with a 2-week induction chemotherapy regimen of vincristine, dexamethasone, and L-asparaginase (VXL). Leukemia engraftment was monitored weekly based on the proportion of human versus mouse CD45+ cells in the murine PB, and the median times to engraftment were compared according to patient outcome. The median time to engraft was also compared between the VXL-treated and non-treated groups. PDXs harvested from mice were compared for ex vivo sensitivity to single agent vincristine, dexamethasone and L-asparaginase. PDX gene expression profiles were also compared to identify pathways associated with evasion of VXL treatment in vivo. Results: The efficiency of engraftment was greater for NSG mice (29/32 mice engrafted) versus NOD/SCID mice (20/32 mice), and primary ALL cells also engrafted significantly faster in NSG mice (median time to engraft 71.1 days) compared with NOD/SCID mice (83.5 days) (P 119.8 days). Further, ex vivo analysis showed that the PDXs derived from the ALL-Rel patients exhibited resistance to vincristine or L-asparaginase compared with those derived from the ALL-CR1 cases. Moreover, the in vivo VXL treatment of an ALL-CR1 PDX resulted in selection of cells that exhibited vincristine resistance. Gene expression profiling revealed significant up-regulation of microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) and tubulin isotypes (alpha and beta) in vincristine-resistant PDXs. Genes that were significantly upregulted in vincristine resistant PDXs with a false discovery rate (FDR) Conclusions: In vivo selection of PDXs with an induction-type regimen of chemotherapeutic drugs may lead to improved relapse prediction and identify novel mechanisms of drug resistance in IR pediatric ALL.

5c3fa763adfa33e128baa249a52496e264237c6d,A multi-model statistical approach for proteomic spectral count quantitation.,"UNLABELLED
The rapid development of mass spectrometry (MS) technologies has solidified shotgun proteomics as the most powerful analytical platform for large-scale proteome interrogation. The ability to map and determine differential expression profiles of the entire proteome is the ultimate goal of shotgun proteomics. Label-free quantitation has proven to be a valid approach for discovery shotgun proteomics, especially when sample is limited. Label-free spectral count quantitation is an approach analogous to RNA sequencing whereby count data is used to determine differential expression. Here we show that statistical approaches developed to evaluate differential expression in RNA sequencing experiments can be applied to detect differential protein expression in label-free discovery proteomics. This approach, termed MultiSpec, utilizes open-source statistical platforms; namely edgeR, DESeq and baySeq, to statistically select protein candidates for further investigation. Furthermore, to remove bias associated with a single statistical approach a single ranked list of differentially expressed proteins is assembled by comparing edgeR and DESeq q-values directly with the false discovery rate (FDR) calculated by baySeq. This statistical approach is then extended when applied to spectral count data derived from multiple proteomic pipelines. The individual statistical results from multiple proteomic pipelines are integrated and cross-validated by means of collapsing protein groups.


BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Spectral count data from shotgun proteomics experiments is semi-quantitative and semi-random, yet a robust way to estimate protein concentration. Tag-count approaches are routinely used to analyze RNA sequencing data sets. This approach, termed MultiSpec, utilizes multiple tag-count based statistical tests to determine differential protein expression from spectral counts. The statistical results from these tag-count approaches are combined in order to reach a final MultiSpec q-value to re-rank protein candidates. This re-ranking procedure is completed to remove bias associated with a single approach in order to better understand the true proteomic differences driving the biology in question. The MultiSpec approach can be extended to multiple proteomic pipelines. In such an instance, MultiSpec statistical results are integrated by collapsing protein groups across proteomic pipelines to provide a single ranked list of differentially expressed proteins. This integration mechanism is seamlessly integrated with the statistical analysis and provides the means to cross-validate protein inferences from multiple proteomic pipelines.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Owen E.

This paper considers joint testing for regression coefficients over multiple responses and develops simultaneous testing methods with false discovery rate control. The test statistic is based on inverse regression and biasâ€corrected group lasso estimates of the regression coefficients and is shown to have an asymptotic chiâ€squared null distribution. A rowâ€wise multiple testing procedure is developed to identify the covariates associated with the responses. The procedure is shown to control the false discovery proportion and false discovery rate at a prespecified level asymptotically. Simulations demonstrate the gain in power, relative to entrywise testing, in detecting the covariates associated with the responses. The test is applied to an ovarian cancer dataset to identify the microRNA regulators that regulate protein expression.",2018,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yin Xia"", ids = ""49289914""); list(name = ""T.

Here we studied differentially expressed coding and non-coding genes in relation to SSc pathogenesis with a specific focus on antisense non-coding RNAs. Objectives Here we studied differentially expressed coding and non-coding genes in relation to SSc pathogenesis with a specific focus on antisense non-coding RNAs. Methods Skin biopsy-derived RNAs from fourteen early SSc patients and six healthy individuals were sequenced with ion-torrent and analysed using DEseq2. Protein-coding and non-coding genes annotated in GENCODEV7 were analysed. Significant long non-coding RNAs were independently replicated in a Northern American dataset. Results 4901 genes with a fold change >1.5 and a false discovery rate of less than 5% were detected in patients versus controls. Upregulated coding genes clustered in immunological, cell adhesion and keratin-related processes as previously found by microarray studies. Interestingly, 676 deregulated non-coding genes were detected, 257 of which were classified as antisense genes. 42% of these antisense genes had a concurrent deregulated sense gene. The majority of the sense-antisense genes had a similar effect sizes in an independent North American dataset with three genes (OTUD6B-AS1, CTBP1-AS2 and HMGN3-AS1) exceeding the study-wide Bonferroni-corrected &rgr;-value (PBonf<0.0024, Pcombined=1.6x10-9, 1.7x10-6, 2.6xx10-6, respectively). Intriguingly, the correlation of sense-antisense gene pairs deregulated in SSc is stronger than sense-antisense gene pairs not deregulated in SSc (p<0.001). Conclusions For the first time we highlight that together with coding genes, (antisense) long noncoding RNAs are deregulated in skin tissue of SSc patients suggesting a novel class of genes involved in pathogenesis of SSc.

203fe65b6fe15b032546eb3a202b6ce2546cef02,Evaluating network brain connectivity in alcohol postdependent state using Network-Based Statistic,"The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals has become an indispensable tool to investigate how brain regions interact and form long-range networks. Statistical dependency measures between brain regions obtained from BOLD signals can inform about brain functional states in longitudinal studies of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, its non-invasive nature allows comparable measurements in clinical and animal studies, providing excellent translational capabilities. In the present study, we apply Network-Based Statistic (NBS) to investigate alterations in the functional connectivity (FC) of the rat brain in a post-dependent (PD) state, an established animal model of clinical relevant features in alcoholism. In contrast to mass-univariate tests, in which comparisons are performed at single link-level, NBS enhances the statistical power by assuming that the connections comprising the effect of interest are interconnected. Brain-wide resting-state fMRI signals were collected in 14 controls and 13 PD rats, and Pearson correlations computed between 47 brain regions of interest (ROIs). The NBS analysis revealed statistically significant differences in a connected network of structures including hippocampus, amygdala, lateral hypothalamus and the raphe nucleus, all regions with known relevance for addictive behaviors. In contrast, no individual connection could be found significant by univariate comparisons with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Correlations between the structures in the identified subnetwork tend to decrease or become negative (anti-correlated) in the PD state compared to controls. We interpret this result as evidence for a disconnected subnetwork in the PD state.",2017,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Antonio DÃ­az-Parra"", ids = ""1403309570""); list(name = ""Ursula Perez-Ramirez"", ids = ""1399317395""); list(name = ""Jesus Pacheco-Torres"", ids = ""1404938233""); list(name = ""Simone Pfarr"", ids = ""7511135""); list(name = ""Wolfgang H.

868b6903d69ab78ebb963e06e0b654bddc169198,BLR-D: applying bilinear logistic regression to factored diagnosis problems,"In this paper, we address a pattern of diagnosis problems in which each of J entities produces the same K features, yet we are only informed of overall faults from the ensemble. Furthermore, we suspect that only certain entities and certain features are leading to the problem. The task, then, is to reliably identify which entities and which features are at fault. Such problems are particularly prevalent in the world of computer systems, in which a datacenter with hundreds of machines, each with the same performance counters, occasionally produces overall faults. In this paper, we present a means of using a constrained form of bilinear logistic regression for diagnosis in such problems. The bilinear treatment allows us to represent the scenarios with J+K instead of JK parameters, resulting in more easily interpretable results and far fewer false positives compared to treating the parameters independently. We develop statistical tests to determine which features and entities, if any, may be responsible for the labeled faults, and use false discovery rate (FDR) analysis to ensure that our values are meaningful.

73e0ed82f99aeb7b3b651b8ac1d812b86ca5648e,Validity of using a work habits scale for the daily evaluation of nurse anesthetists' clinical performance while controlling for the leniencies of the rating anesthesiologists.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE
Anesthesiologists can provide psychometrically reliable daily evaluations of certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) work habits for purposes of the mandatory ongoing professional practice evaluation (OPPE). Our goal was to evaluate the validity of assessing CRNA work habits.


DESIGN
Observational study.


SETTING
Large teaching hospital.


MEASUREMENTS
N=77 anesthesiologists evaluated work habits of N=67 CRNAs. The non-technical attribute of work habits was measured on a 6-item scale (e.g., 1=""Only assumed responsibility when forced to, and failed to follow through consistently"" versus 5=""Consistently identified tasks and completed them efficiently and thoroughly""). One year of scores were used to assess validity. Each daily evaluation could also be accompanied by a written comment. Content analysis of comments was performed using two years of data. Statistical analyses were performed using mixed effects logistic regression, treating each anesthesiologist as a fixed effect to compensate for the leniency of their ratings.


MAIN RESULTS
The N=77 anesthesiologists' response rate was 97.3%, obtained at a mean 2.93days after the request. The internal consistency of the scale was large: Cronbach's alpha 0.952. Controlling the false discovery rate at 5.0%, among the 67 CRNAs, 8 were significantly below average (each Pâ‰¤0.0048) and 6 were above average (each Pâ‰¤0.0018). During the 6months after CRNAs knew that their work habits scores would be used for OPPE, there were significant increases in the scores compared with the preceding 6months (odds ratio 1.93, P<0.0001). Greater CRNA's qualitative annual evaluation scores made by the chief CRNA, without knowledge of the work habit scores or comments, were associated with greater odds of the CRNA's leniency-adjusted work habit scores equaling 5.00 (odds ratio 1.53, P=0.0004). Comments of negative sentiment made by the anesthesiologists were associated with greater odds of the leniency-adjusted work habit scores being <5.00 (odds ratio 54.5, P<0.0001). Even though the anesthesiologists were already providing information about work habits using the work habits scale, approximately half the comments of negative sentiment included the theme of work habits (92/153, 60.1%).


CONCLUSIONS
Reporting OPPE metrics are mandatory for the maintenance of clinical privileges of anesthesia practitioners in the USA. Basing such peer review on work habits can be quantitative, psychometrically reliable, and valid.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Franklin Dexter"", ids = ""144441416""); list(name = ""Johannes Ledolter"", ids = ""3013323""); list(name = ""Bradley J.

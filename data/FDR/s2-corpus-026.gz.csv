f2f5cbb9bd580da160d0aceda8b889be598c908d,Testing multiple hypotheses through IMP weighted FDR based on a genetic functional network with application to a new zebrafish transcriptome study,"In genome-wide studies, hundreds of thousands of hypothesis tests are performed simultaneously. Bonferroni correction and False Discovery Rate (FDR) can effectively control type I error but often yield a high false negative rate. We aim to develop a more powerful method to detect differentially expressed genes. We present a Weighted False Discovery Rate (WFDR) method that incorporate biological knowledge from genetic networks. We first identify weights using Integrative Multi-species Prediction (IMP) and then apply the weights in WFDR to identify differentially expressed genes through an IMP-WFDR algorithm. We performed a gene expression experiment to identify zebrafish genes that change expression in the presence of arsenic during a systemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Zebrafish were exposed to arsenic at 10 parts per billion and/or infected with P. aeruginosa. Appropriate controls were included. We then applied IMP-WFDR during the analysis of differentially expressed genes. We compared the mRNA expression for each group and found over 200 differentially expressed genes and several enriched pathways including defense response pathways, arsenic response pathways, and the Notch signaling pathway.",2015,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jiang Gui"", ids = ""2288741""); list(name = ""Casey S.

b81ef634b8ccf0ce0d11aeaf235c7fa4647454e4,Differential gene expression in senescing leaves of two silver birch genotypes in response to elevated CO 2 and tropospheric ozonepce,"Long-term effects of elevated CO2 and O3 concentrations on gene expression in silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) leaves were studied during the end of the growing season. Two birch genotypes, clones 4 and 80, with different ozone growth responses, were exposed to 2Â¥ ambient CO2 and/or O3 in open-top chambers (OTCs). Microarray analyses were performed after 2 years of exposure, and the transcriptional profiles were compared to key physiological characteristics during leaf senescence. There were genotypic differences in the responses to CO2 and O3. Clone 80 exhibited greater transcriptional response and capacity to alter metabolism, resulting in better stress tolerance. The gene expression patterns of birch leaves indicated contrasting responses of senescence-related genes to elevated CO2 and O3. Elevated CO2 delayed leaf senescence and reduced associated transcriptional changes, whereas elevated O3 advanced leaf senescence because of increased oxidative stress. The combined treatment demonstrated that elevated CO2 only temporarily alleviated the negative effects of O3. Gene expression data alone were insufficient to explain the O3 response in birch, and additional physiological and biochemical data were required to understand the true O3 sensitivity of these clones.

INTRODUCTION Over the last few decades, human activity has accelerated atmospheric changes. CO2 emissions have increased by about 80% between 1970 and 2004 (IPCC 2007). In parallel, increasing NOx and hydrocarbon emissions cause higher tropospheric ozone (O3) concentrations (Percy & Ferretti 2004). For plants, these changes have contrasting effects. Rising CO2 concentration increases photosynthesis, which in C3 plants is limited by atmospheric [CO2] (e.g. Drake, Jacob & Gonzalez-Meler 2000; Woodward 2002). However, the CO2 responses in plants show great variation because of differences between species and in other environmental factors (Drake et al. 2000; Woodward 2002; Nowak, Ellsworth & Smith 2004). Forest trees are generally the most responsive to elevated [CO2] (Ainsworth & Long 2005). O3 is considered the most harmful tropospheric pollutant to plants (Matyssek & Sandermann 2003) because it affects nearly all photosynthetic processes (Long & Naidu 2002) and causes damage to cell structures (Oksanen et al. 2004). Therefore, O3 accelerates climate change by reducing the ability of plants to accumulate carbon via photosynthesis to biomass production. It has recently been suggested that the role of O3 in decreasing the CO2 uptake is underestimated in the current carbon sequestration models (Sitch et al. 2007; Wittig, Ainsworth & Long 2007). The impact of O3 on plants is determined by [O3], O3 stomatal flux, exposure length and the plant defence capabilities such as the antioxidative capacity of the plant (Baier et al. 2005). O3 sensitivity is also dependent on developmental factors such as the age of plant (Nunn et al. 2005; Karnosky et al. 2007;Wittig et al. 2007), leaf ontogeny (Oksanen et al. 2005) and the timing of exposure and tree size (Oksanen 2003). Chronic O3 stress during several growing seasons with fluctuating [O3] and adaptation to the stress requires the adjustment of metabolism. The adjustment results in changes in resource allocation, in favour of repair, defence and compensations mechanisms (Dizengremel 2001).The metabolic modifications in chronic O3 are seen as Correspondence: S.

The simultaneous exposure of plants to elevated [CO2] and [O3] has resulted in both decreased growth and compensation for the O3-induced growth losses by CO2 (Rebbeck & Scherzer 2002; Kubiske et al. 2006). In silver birch, only small growth losses were found in elevated [O3], and the growth responses in a combined elevated [CO2] and [O3] treatment were similar to responses in elevated [CO2] (Riikonen et al. 2004). These two greenhouse gases also have opposite effects on leaf senescence. While the onset of leaf abscission (Riikonen et al. 2004) and leaf yellowing (SyrjÃ¤lÃ¤ et al. unpublished) are delayed in elevated [CO2], they are accelerated by O3 promoting early leaf abscission (Karnosky et al. 1996; Nowak et al. 2004; Riikonen et al. 2004). The effects of elevated [CO2] on the transcriptome have been studied, for example, in soy bean (Ainsworth et al. 2006; Casteel et al. 2008), Arabidopsis (Li et al. 2006b) and in the tree Populus (Gupta et al. 2005; Taylor et al. 2005; Druart et al. 2006; Cseke et al. 2009). These studies show that responses to elevated [CO2] vary depending on species, genotypes and leaf ages. Both decreased (Li et al. 2006b) and increased (Gupta et al. 2005) accumulation of photosynthesis light-harvesting transcripts have been observed. Elevated [CO2] also alters the flux through various biosynthetic routes, and changes secondary metabolite composition. In Populus, the flavonoid biosynthesis route was activated (Druart et al. 2006). Expression of phenylpropanoid pathway genes decreased (Gupta et al. 2005), or alternatively decreased or increased depending on the Populus genotype (Cseke et al. 2009). Elevated [CO2] enhances cell expansion-related genes (Gupta et al. 2005; Taylor et al. 2005; Druart et al. 2006) and mediates changes in metabolism by inducing genes related to signalling and regulation (Ainsworth et al. 2006; Li et al. 2006b). In addition, candidate genes for determining plant adaptation to elevated [CO2] have been studied with Populus (Rae et al. 2006, 2007). Acute O3 exposure of tree leaves elicits defence gene expression commonly induced by all kinds of oxidative stress (Olbrich et al. 2005; Rizzo et al. 2007), correspondingly to data on herbaceous plants (e.g. Tamaoki et al. 2003; Li et al. 2006a;Tosti et al. 2006).The changes in gene expression observed for chronic O3 exposure in mature trees are similar to, but often of smaller magnitude than in acute stress, and are influenced by other stresses in field experiments (Gupta et al. 2005; Jehnes et al. 2007; Paolacci et al. 2007). Furthermore, different O3-responsive mechanisms may function, depending on the level of O3 and on acute or chronic stress (Vahala et al. 2003). Changes in gene expression caused by the combined treatment with elevated [CO2] and [O3] have so far been reported in only two studies. In soy bean, the combined treatment produced relatively few alterations in gene expression (Casteel et al. 2008). The combined treatment in Populus led to gene expression patterns different from either gas alone (Gupta et al. 2005). In the current study, as a part of a larger climate change experiment (see e.g. Riikonen et al. 2004; Vapaavuori et al. 2009), we report genotypic differences in the gene expression patterns of birch (Betula pendula Roth) leaves caused by long-term exposure to elevated [CO2] and [O3]. Two birch clones, showing different sensitivity to O3 in terms of growth (Riikonen et al. 2004), were exposed to elevated [CO2] and [O3] alone and in combination, in open-top chambers (OTCs). This study focuses on leaf senescence phenomenon, because our previous phenological data showed differences in leaf abscission between genotypes, delayed abscission in elevated CO2 and a trend for accelerated senescence in elevated O3 (Riikonen et al. 2004). Leaf samples were harvested twice at the end of the second exposure summer, and gene expression patterns were analysed with DNA microarrays. The gene expression data are compared to key physiological parameters in order to understand mechanistic links.

2c7bf34c272730e3ba672ad51fe33e4ece250fc1,Expression of the extracellular matrix gene periostin is increased in chronic rhinosinusitis and decreases following successful endoscopic sinus surgery.,"BACKGROUND
The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a potentially important component of mucosal immunity. ECM dysregulation in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is suggested by genomewide association studies identifying ECM genes as top candidates. Further support is afforded by the demonstration of increased expression of periostin (POSTN) in CRS biopsy samples compared to controls, and by reported roles in eosinophilic inflammation and steroid responsiveness. We wished to evaluate the potential utility of POSTN as a biomarker for disease activity by determining whether POSTN levels were modified in disease and whether they were modulated by endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS).


METHODS
Twelve patients undergoing ESS for CRS and 10 controls undergoing ESS for skull-base access were recruited. An epithelial sample from the frontal recess was collected using a cytology brush at time of and 3 months after surgery. Microarray analysis of gene expression was performed using the Illumina HumanHT-12 Beadchip v3. POSTN protein level in biopsy samples taken from the same place of brushings at surgery was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining.


RESULTS
All patients resolved CRS with ESS. At surgery, a higher expression of POSTN was seen in the CRS group compared to controls (fold change [FC] = 4.89, positive false discovery rate (pFDR) = 0.0006), which was also verified by IHC. After ESS, POSTN expression in CRS group decreased (FC = -3.074, pFDR = 0.0044), and was no longer different from controls (FC = 1.56, pFDR = 0.3).


CONCLUSION
Demonstration of reduced levels in the expression of POSTN, an ECM gene, following resolution of disease, implicates POSTN, a potential pathogenesis indicator or biomarker of CRS disease activity and responsiveness to treatment.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wenling Zhang"", ids = ""47528277""); list(name = ""Gregory Hubin"", ids = ""11387582""); list(name = ""Leandra Mfuna Endam"", ids = ""3586812""); list(name = ""Sawsan Al-Mot"", ids = ""11838914""); list(name = ""Abdelali Filali-Mouhim"", ids = ""1398928517""); list(name = ""Martin Y.

This paper reports on new methods for false discovery control that can usefully be applied to functional neuroimaging data, especially for thresholding statistical maps. The methods are based on controlling the unobserved false discovery proportion (FDP) the number of false rejections divided by the number of rejections simultaneously over all thresholds. From this, one can design thresholding procedures to control the false discovery rate and other features of the false discovery process, including the probability that FDP exceeds a specified level or the expected proportion of false regions. We give two variants on these procedures, one for unsmoothed data and one for smoothed data based on random field models.

As data are collected at an ever-growing scale, statistical machine learning faces some new challenges: high dimensionality, strong dependence among observed variables, heavy-tailed variables and heterogeneity. High-dimensional robust factor analysis serves as a powerful toolkit to conquer these challenges. 
This paper gives a selective overview on recent advance on high-dimensional factor models and their applications to statistics including Factor-Adjusted Robust Model selection (FarmSelect) and Factor-Adjusted Robust Multiple testing (FarmTest). We show that classical methods, especially principal component analysis (PCA), can be tailored to many new problems and provide powerful tools for statistical estimation and inference. We highlight PCA and its connections to matrix perturbation theory, robust statistics, random projection, false discovery rate, etc., and illustrate through several applications how insights from these fields yield solutions to modern challenges. We also present far-reaching connections between factor models and popular statistical learning problems, including network analysis and low-rank matrix recovery.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jianqing Fan"", ids = ""144958606"");

528c31d7d09ea1feed8a175e1a9a584894389223,Tagging SNPs in the ERCC4 gene are associated with gastric cancer risk.,"ERCC4 plays an essential role in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is involved in the removal of a wide variety of DNA lesions. To determine whether the ERCC4 tagging SNPs (tSNPs) are associated with risk of gastric cancer, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study of 350 cases and 468 cancer-free controls. In the logistic regression (LR) analysis, we found a significantly decreased risk of gastric cancer associated with the rs744154 GC/CC genotypes [adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.42-0.75, false discovery rate (FDR) P=0.003] compared with the wild-type GG genotype. Haplotype-based association study revealed that the CGC haplotype that containing the rs744154 C allele can decrease the risk of gastric cancer compared with the most common haplotype GGT (adjusted OR=0.61, 95% CI=0.46-0.81). Using the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis, we identified that the SNP rs744154 and smoking status were the best two predictive factors for gastric cancer with a testing accuracy of 55.76% and a perfect cross-validation consistency (CVC) of 10 (P=0.001). Furthermore, the smokers with the rs744154 GC/CC genotypes showed a decreased risk of gastric cancer (adjusted OR=0.55, 95% CI=0.35-0.85) compared with the smokers with the GG genotype using multivariate LR analysis. The above findings consistently suggested that genetic variants in the ERCC4 gene may play a protective role in the etiology of gastric cancer, even in the smokers.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Haiyan Chu"", ids = ""2063143""); list(name = ""Qinghong Zhao"", ids = ""5904259""); list(name = ""Shizhi Wang"", ids = ""4493562""); list(name = ""Meilin Wang"", ids = ""38673410""); list(name = ""Ming Xu"", ids = ""49235640""); list(name = ""Yan Gao"", ids = ""48146945""); list(name = ""Dewei Luo"", ids = ""10595671""); list(name = ""Yongfei Tan"", ids = ""6093793""); list(name = ""Weida Gong"", ids = ""7018456""); list(name = ""Zhengdong Zhang"", ids = ""2554701""); list(name = ""Dongmei Wu"", ids = ""49709275"")",f24dc3f29c4b6a4a94120b066f9c468589080792; 1640dd89b1d1e9f0edd3947fe155b263edc1cc9a,082be66efb3338dabc6b376990a9385fa3143597; fabeeaf1e1b349405ec3de2115952c3c6fec1842; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 2b7d1a9695b90cd19460a6b6f476af5e6a111a34; ba0c9a1c391926ee3704c2d4e7bcd9150eef62e3; d5c6eb99f2955825bb966e9f3745c6878f2aebe3; 795f84606583b6a3a86aa4a3f24cf4563c5b10e0; 7bf3f2014cdfbeecbe5e45535f10a18533cc0f82; 6b9b3b484015a0f46a7d5a9643b75af927d24c93; 5067734036985c8ea4321f387d934cc3b73522c2; 8a1438f4e4ca9c91c2edd780b51086c9dcbff233; f5e961c09e29b96fe98a6ab25dc3082484efcdcf; 32f15ab939d220942d424cfbe2a175acd333facc; de957c2e238dca2e56419fe97b46565e4a0d2adb; ce3837e273744e7c1855c4e2abacca81bef57f75; 1dd5633ec93a9287cf961a5601c694eb7c2496ae; 721268ea924df18f5a262d1974479f00623f6370; a525270ee1ce67b44ae45e68737280cbfda5912a; e0201e2e00ffbfd336627644685baa448e4a05af; ad6da9c78cba0e76f6c4fca0d5f97ea33b964f52; a23548abe5c7fa4ae382333e0fb1d1ba7c4eb259; b188eecc76ca241738297f518d7402f823902225; 56265ec2c7a881d0e65bf3f3d75aa49576d9161a; 91dff76d1e364b742b6bef1037f8f74dca136860; 2bc856f849c40972cc99bc77dbf6b31788e8756a; af864f2956a684bf0a56d09f314674a3f7308211; 3a93ed6e4424929a00407626dda586333bb59bf6; b915abfaad52e38fe1572e420d05f45a0cfaade1; 9af70b75c3213e57fb107529b1c72b8b321aab11; 6f341080635882c1c6eca4ba1361e3aa10da9de8; 57123d6d87e3a923d6a939232f1fd57f0a88e866; 4aa550f3835bd19bee3d95931e7f7f7516c8b900; bad8258592b41adefde824de2ddcce8269fb04cb; 1403263d33bb317d11107a953aaf7356e729542e; b130323ee94d95e49e0594c801a70597c6fd359b,Gene,521 1,"

fbd892cef92297fe12133724d79399890ba2e172,Genetic variations in RORÎ± are associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-Î± (RORÎ±) plays a key role in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol metabolism that has been implicated in the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of this study was to determine the frequencies of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RORÎ± gene in a Chinese population and their possible association with COPD susceptibility. Nine tagging SNPs, including rs17270181, rs1898413, rs17270216, rs8033552, rs8036966, rs7169364, rs340002, rs340023 and rs11630262, were screened in 279 COPD patients and 367 controls by the SNaPshot method. Association analysis of genotypes and haplotypes constructed from these loci with COPD was conducted under different genetic models. Alleles or genotypes of rs8033552 distributed significantly differently in COPD patients and controls (allele: P=0.0001, false discovery rate (FDR) Q=0.004, odds ratios (OR): 1.62 and 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27â€“2.07; genotype: P=0.0005, FDR Q=0.008). The allele A at rs8033552 was potentially associated with an increased risk of COPD in additive model, displaying ORs of 1.62 (95% CI: 1.17â€“2.26, P=0.004, FDR Q=0.019) in subjects with genotypes AG vs GG and 2.69 (95% CI: 1.47â€“4.93, P=0.001, FDR Q=0.011) in subjects with genotypes AA vs GG, respectively. In haplotype analysis, we observed haplotypes GGAGATGTG and GGAGCTGTG had protective effects, whereas haplotypes GGAGATACA and GGAGATACG were significantly associated with the increased risk of COPD.

25da657800cd63b2ed2316169b555387b0242903,A decision-theory approach to interpretable set analysis for high-dimensional data.,"A key problem in high-dimensional significance analysis is to find pre-defined sets that show enrichment for a statistical signal of interest; the classic example is the enrichment of gene sets for differentially expressed genes. Here, we propose a new decision-theory approach to the analysis of gene sets which focuses on estimating the fraction of non-null variables in a set. We introduce the idea of ""atoms,"" non-overlapping sets based on the original pre-defined set annotations. Our approach focuses on finding the union of atoms that minimizes a weighted average of the number of false discoveries and missed discoveries. We introduce a new false discovery rate for sets, called the atomic false discovery rate (afdr), and prove that the optimal estimator in our decision-theory framework is to threshold the afdr. These results provide a coherent and interpretable framework for the analysis of sets that addresses the key issues of overlapping annotations and difficulty in interpreting p values in both competitive and self-contained tests. We illustrate our method and compare it to a popular existing method using simulated examples, as well as gene-set and brain ROI data analyses.",2013,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Simina M.

However, effectively and efficiently pinpointing causal variants remains a serious challenge. Here, we developed CARMEN, a novel algorithm to identify functional noncoding expression-modulating variants. Multiple evaluations demonstrated CARMENâ€™s superior performance over state-of-the-art tools. Its higher sensitivity and low false discovery rate enable CARMEN to identify multiple causal expression-modulating variants that other tools simply missed. Meanwhile, benefitting from extensive annotations generated, CARMEN provides mechanism hints on predicted expression-modulating variants, enabling effectively characterizing functional variants involved in gene expression and disease-related phenotypes.

38879c6cfce81f1ef43df8e91354019911ec248c,Gene Expression Of TMEM178 Decreases With The Progression Of Asthma Severity: 617,"Naiya B. Patel, MD, Lorena Ostilla, MD, Lyda Cuervo-Pardo, MD, Sergejs Berdnikovs, PhD, and Sergio E. Chiarella, MD; Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL. RATIONALE: The transmembrane protein 178 (Tmem178) is a novel negative regulator of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFAT1c); a recognized player in asthma pathogenesis. Our group has previously shown that changes in TMEM178 gene expression are associated with lower airway obstruction in asthmatics having an acute respiratory illness-induced exacerbation. We sought to compare the relative gene expression of TMEM178 in the airway epithelium of severe asthmatics to that in the airway epithelium of non-severe asthmatics and healthy controls. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of two high-quality publicly available microarray datasets (National Center for Biotechnology Informationâ€™s Gene Expression Omnibus database; accession numbers GSE43696 andGSE63142), which contained epithelial brushings obtained by bronchoscopy from asthmatics and healthy donors. For differential gene expression comparisons, moderated Benjamini-Hochberg t-tests (with false discovery rate adjustments) and Dunnâ€™s multiple comparison tests were used. RESULTS: In the first microarray study (GSE43696), severe asthmatics had significantly lower levels of TMEM178 gene expression when compared to moderate asthmatics (p-value <0.05) and healthy controls (p-value <0.0001). Similarly, in the second microarray study (GSE63142), severe asthmatics had significantly lower levels of TMEM178 gene expression when compared to non-severe asthmatics (pvalue <0.001) and healthy controls (p-value <0.0001). Overall, TMEM178 gene expression negatively correlates with asthma severity. CONCLUSIONS: In two independent microarray studies, the relative gene expression of TMEM178 decreased with the progression of asthma severity. We speculate that Tmem178 may play an important role in the regulation of NFAT-induced inflammation in severe asthmatics.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Naiya B.

e31758f26a14f95baee208a9354dfb57960d86ea,Structural Brain Changes in Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Subjects Using the LONI Pipeline Environment.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
This study investigates 36 subjects aged 55-65 from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database to expand our knowledge of early-onset (EO) Alzheimer's Disease (EO-AD) using neuroimaging biomarkers.


METHODS
Nine of the subjects had EO-AD, and 27 had EO mild cognitive impairment (EO-MCI). The structural ADNI data were parcellated using BrainParser, and the 15 most discriminating neuroimaging markers between the two cohorts were extracted using the Global Shape Analysis (GSA) Pipeline workflow. Then the Local Shape Analysis (LSA) Pipeline workflow was used to conduct local (per-vertex) post-hoc statistical analyses of the shape differences based on the participants' diagnoses (EO-MCI+EO-AD). Tensor-based Morphometry (TBM) and multivariate regression models were used to identify the significance of the structural brain differences based on the participants' diagnoses.


RESULTS
The significant between-group regional differences using GSA were found in 15 neuroimaging markers. The results of the LSA analysis workflow were based on the subject diagnosis, age, years of education, apolipoprotein E (Îµ4), Mini-Mental State Examination, visiting times, and logical memory as regressors. All the variables had significant effects on the regional shape measures. Some of these effects survived the false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Similarly, the TBM analysis showed significant effects on the Jacobian displacement vector fields, but these effects were reduced after FDR correction.


CONCLUSIONS
These results may explain some of the differences between EO-AD and EO-MCI, and some of the characteristics of the EO cognitive impairment subjects.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Seok Woo Moon"", ids = ""2981964""); list(name = ""Ivo D.

8558a792f48f335b1f032c747ec506dc21dac54d,Ethnic specificity of lupus-associated loci identified in a genome-wide association study in Korean women.,"OBJECTIVES
To identify novel genetic candidates for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the Korean population, and to validate the risk loci for SLE identified in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS).


METHODS
We performed a GWAS in 400 Korean female SLE patients and 445 controls. Selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were then replicated in an independent cohort of 385 SLE patients and 583 controls (replication cohort 1), and in a further 811 SLE patients and 1502 controls (replication cohort 2).


RESULTS
In the GWAS phase, rs9275428 located near HLA-DQB1 showed the strongest association with SLE (OR 0.50, false discovery rate (FDR) p=3.07Ã—10(-6)). Although no loci reached genome-wide significance outside major histocompatibility complex (MHC), C8orf13-BLK, STAT4, CSMD1, DIAPH3, GLDC and TNFSF4 showed FDR pâ€‰<â€‰0.05. Our results suggest that STAT4, BLK, IRF5, PTTG1-miR-146a, UBE2L3 and TNFAIP3 are shared susceptibility loci among Caucasians and Asians, while ETS1, IKZF1, SLC15A4 are likely to be Asian-specific loci. In a combined analysis of 1596 SLE patients and 2540 controls for selected 22 candidate SNP, STAT4 and BLK as positive controls showed a strong association with SLE (FDR p=9.85Ã—10(-13) and 2.28Ã—10(-8), respectively). Of these, 16 candidates (PEX5L, TRAJ50, MYO18B, SOS1, ARHGAP26, SMURF1, CADPS, HAND1, FAM78B, DIAPH3, TBL1XR1, CSMD1, ZBTB20, C3orf21, HIPK1 and AP001042.1) showed only nominal significance (7.05Ã—10(-4)â‰¤FDR pâ‰¤4.38Ã—10(-2)).


CONCLUSIONS
There are similarities and differences in genetic susceptibility for SLE between Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups. Although 16 putative novel loci for SLE have been suggested in the Korean population, further research on a larger sample is required to discriminate truth from error.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hye-Soon Lee"", ids = ""66406778""); list(name = ""Taehyeung Kim"", ids = ""6603653""); list(name = ""So Young Bang"", ids = ""152777629""); list(name = ""Young Ji Na"", ids = ""3720563""); list(name = ""Il Kim"", ids = ""145501459""); list(name = ""Kwangwoo Kim"", ids = ""3771498""); list(name = ""Jae-Hoon Kim"", ids = ""31459610""); list(name = ""Yeun-Jun Chung"", ids = ""48437578""); list(name = ""Hyoung Doo Shin"", ids = ""4260580""); list(name = ""Young Mo Kang"", ids = ""144283700""); list(name = ""Seung-Cheol Shim"", ids = ""144366300""); list(name = ""Chang-Hee Suh"", ids = ""144344830""); list(name = ""Yong-Beom Park"", ids = ""145423709""); list(name = ""Jong-Sung Kim"", ids = ""1723192""); list(name = ""Changwon Kang"", ids = ""35203038""); list(name = ""S.

ace748df0e2971e1a2c300201e51ed11c3dbf3c9,The impact of amplification on differential expression analyses by RNA-seq,"Currently, quantitative RNA-seq methods are pushed to work with increasingly small starting amounts of RNA that require amplification. However, it is unclear how much noise or bias amplification introduces and how this affects precision and accuracy of RNA quantification. To assess the effects of amplification, reads that originated from the same RNA molecule (PCR-duplicates) need to be identified. Computationally, read duplicates are defined by their mapping position, which does not distinguish PCR- from natural duplicates and hence it is unclear how to treat duplicated reads. Here, we generate and analyse RNA-seq data sets prepared using three different protocols (Smart-Seq, TruSeq and UMI-seq). We find that a large fraction of computationally identified read duplicates are not PCR duplicates and can be explained by sampling and fragmentation bias. Consequently, the computational removal of duplicates does improve neither accuracy nor precision and can actually worsen the power and the False Discovery Rate (FDR) for differential gene expression. Even when duplicates are experimentally identified by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), power and FDR are only mildly improved. However, the pooling of samples as made possible by the early barcoding of the UMI-protocol leads to an appreciable increase in the power to detect differentially expressed genes.",2016,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Swati Parekh"", ids = ""35561248""); list(name = ""Christoph Ziegenhain"", ids = ""6505284""); list(name = ""Beate Vieth"", ids = ""33914469""); list(name = ""Wolfgang Enard"", ids = ""2089138""); list(name = ""Ines Hellmann"", ids = ""47953656"")",6a4f5c4c84e22257e9542813734d523817df0bc5; 70b8bc5c905166fe154c256a910295cd6e2c1ed3; b4fa91eff5851c1ebe9dda016c470bf77bff4d91; 5f1ad5f07f803c0cad5dedbb130dfd064e0cfcfc; 07ca961d3c7db1b694c6169b9f72663c41feced4; d6c122f69654de6ab35cf84556b47f07412bf616; c22a2638e386d922a84b9014040721f3775efa3a; 4b4a4146834393c5c9acd63c7a4f1bb34e705983; ea04f5412efe5ec9ed7806a2ee6fa86b8bbc2d05; ac1b40a48815d6a432b5e05dd5a4c67c3a7e52a8; f2956ec14b8651a78c81a53472a80a5813098902; d4ab62d9d8c4fc26f69d4f5a552f51e500c3bbc3; 8c8935691ddc2c3d4912b1e38b0244cb48299ed3; b114efd33fb73e2141fa3d2a77254f3e67ba5af4; 16427167f541cf06f9200dfc81ab78f168695559; fdcd40a77fb16fd747af1a061f2d64131fadf916; 94ddc38729bcc6af9eb2d4075ba90ee2cb04e162; cec5840982cee94a91f71fe6abff9e331f3a3f00; e32adb531af8799af3984824fb58be234efac20b; c0a1156fdf36cd35576fab09cba24124ade4c4a2; 3e2a2b955c236a2ae7eed79cda1c9ca04707c1ae; 43ce451f2bb4fadd26c14f44149f8b53b99f02c6; 87f2539edc54f599b68b2e7f7b85f37a07b26016; 66f3e2e3ea66f267d8e5194ae7a95eec003c4d2e; d6df9f912b7ea897afd8c63d7708bc92f99f4ab1; 53bdbe999c8f43b6e65ce423f42d3f8d2708680b; a5c62f4eb79ad753ce9d6d1af74bdf488504c046; 2c768ab42b2c703c6f952e3cac4ef8fd39a43a48; 6d30b1444ba9075799c89b698d4a5008fefb6176; eae1762ee9f9ee564d98c5c966875b51f1cc2ec7; b16c86c7c8685f1a32485474531cd6d35ab72570; dcbd9e859711c4012ba4dcf857bd0c40ef9f5a50; 217f448b78934877113ef4ed78c436f9efcb6cf4; a77eedd6500846fcab3432526f02a8040b3b66d7; 0057deed2c13afc288a6936f1c6aaeb4fea55dd4; 84a903311a726e1416cb719117d28d245773515b; adf2e56c4ceb2241d87b3db01ff26f796056156d; 4a09fb90ee5ff64a155f623455bea5dde3afab4e; ef21cc41a381655f10aa2976f42f265113ee22db; 0c5b8a36ba9505abba6e12f35e30b881de978938; 70154037c2b9687fecbf6b648a0ccb6cdcf98790; 60489c8735a572f2b62d65879b15d96f031fad3e; a652045ed378cd5f4da2dc2f1beaee2e4cc9f568; 042dd49a37f268d6edafc8022b0b7f81c4c73574; 73eb840d9edfb32402dbdbfba1d5cc4798b33877; ad1be6f3c2150c099f0a82ac9c4c7f851f9d3c98; 384391649aa0ec4278706bfb7a3e3be9939d348b; 02c6ca2866898459f099c2dab86f9b44c790cfc3; 6f38968b99042d21eb2941d88761f14939478120; b6e4112965f7ab573da55ea79e3b750b02926747; 3109393967ed9e1b3c5a2e994728d0465ef07995; eb4d3a89f832d575a44e143e07f4067ecaad89f8; 0051a3b009262e082d80f138a1b346769ec8f4bd; 2cc5b857bed57d4e37f2c558a356696cf6f686ad; 7614c3447dc872ad4b1f97c93cefd619fca81552; f8ac75276baf3793d17a62fe39b640e925f330ed; bc71e4ef003823cdd66f3078b109941e9489f3a3; b5bf25648d71b0400d0c71a04a4974779426a3e6; 786269b032694e751c6f2e8208225d0ba8af4edf; 0deed203a69b03a810e87d5943c4ae3d67602711; ade907ce518b621e6e5b61fd1bf3ab0349a1039b,17ceeefde606aebd02f6afbba161bd54ffda83df; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; 4f4e20d943b289aeeb94c3b77837b9c3af37bd49; ac2dd9b30632579464dfb051dd0c5543717db355; b1575e12995315c26847eae3f4e9647da32eed77; e327af139c5ec91d92b7b028915e52aa44cfc421; dcbd9e859711c4012ba4dcf857bd0c40ef9f5a50; cdbe8a265ef4bd8350722d2209fc6cc6290da1b3; 3b159f4698c347b09664cc6eaa0fe881726a5179; a45425efb2b252b14f7eff1fbd5fa5122459f5e0; 040da849feea4b014a5367a2bdb838cce279b4dc; 973beedb9249c1e34a03de911c99c9a9c2cb535e; 085589ca53509ad27edd95827f7198b3ce107024; ca3c197763a1691e3eeaebb3f0ddda06dce81049; 779f1919ab4bac545818971e0e1aad0763db0304; e145a40d2655bf67725fdd3ab17bb4c6cfb10f43; bcf2cf850c73f98bfc918f6bfb45b1c9b9681018; 78ce0c149860363bbbe34306c75a4454ad23828d; dd595760fdc225d0f994b8ec377870d6ab4d4ac3; 0446839238dc22746e99eb746ce11bc7e18f33b1; aef5c344421fc643f0c3206406cd93a15218f325; 7b3a1c907ad5077f07fc7354838dbd2526319740; ae0646aa0ef6d151a6a58f516be591ef412fd77f; bd4f7438f5e8450ce8a04055fbae954c0bd8594a; 98e5b39243f0428fbda31b24e3845dda4000d009; 2bd0f4c2abb162134d3697286ae85953b8db0a83; 817fc8de25f989b8229847fc7710750f273460b6; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; 16101e04e5d8f403b899a7f1ac3ec62ee7f18952; 35cffc5eb76cc57fc00ce2d9a1b0ae823de4f9f1,Scientific Reports,6,
d0231f32a32cb3937342c4a86dbddb2bd55f8c17,Multiscale peak detection in wavelet space.,"Accurate peak detection is essential for analyzing high-throughput datasets generated by analytical instruments. Derivatives with noise reduction and matched filtration are frequently used, but they are sensitive to baseline variations, random noise and deviations in the peak shape. A continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based method is more practical and popular in this situation, which can increase the accuracy and reliability by identifying peaks across scales in wavelet space and implicitly removing noise as well as the baseline. However, its computational load is relatively high and the estimated features of peaks may not be accurate in the case of peaks that are overlapping, dense or weak. In this study, we present multi-scale peak detection (MSPD) by taking full advantage of additional information in wavelet space including ridges, valleys, and zero-crossings. It can achieve a high accuracy by thresholding each detected peak with the maximum of its ridge. It has been comprehensively evaluated with MALDI-TOF spectra in proteomics, the CAMDA 2006 SELDI dataset as well as the Romanian database of Raman spectra, which is particularly suitable for detecting peaks in high-throughput analytical signals. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves show that MSPD can detect more true peaks while keeping the false discovery rate lower than MassSpecWavelet and MALDIquant methods. Superior results in Raman spectra suggest that MSPD seems to be a more universal method for peak detection. MSPD has been designed and implemented efficiently in Python and Cython.

330cebf44d5abb51178c711284abce70330f1c77,Rational Approaches to Correcting for Multiple Tests,"The logic of the Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, or family-wise error, is to set the criterion to reduce the expected number of erroneous false positives, or Type I errors, below 1. This is a very stringent criterion for false positives in cases where the test may be applied millions of times, and will necessarily introduce a large proportion of false negatives (missed positives, or Type II errors). A proposed solution to this problem is to adjust the criterion for False Discovery Rate (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995), which allows the number of false positives to increase proportionally to the number of true positives, though remaining at a small proportion, dramatically reducing the number of false negatives. This approach may be conceptualized as working with a relaxed confidence level that any one test is a true rather than a false positive, bringing the criterion more into line with our societal assessment of the validity of statements in general, and even in science, as having less than 100% certainty. The analytic strategy to the assessment of statistical significance provides a more intuitive approach to the identification of sparse signals in large datasets than the standard Bonferroni approach to correction for multiple tests. Introduction The role of statistical testing is to set meaningful limits on what may be regarded as the error range for statistical estimates. However, functional error ranges depend on the number of times a test is applied, which in the era of â€˜big dataâ€™ may number in the millions of applications, making a criterion that reduces false alarms to 1 in 20 applications (symbolized as p < 0.05) subject to unacceptable numbers of false alarms. It is therefore important to provide an adequate approach to the assessment of large numbers of multiple tests when applying them to large datasets, such as those encountered in product quality control, identification of genetic substrates of diseases or individual characteristics, or high-resolution medical imaging such as brain connectivity analysis. The Era of Big Data The 21 century may be characterized as the beginning of the era of Big Data, spearheaded by the Human Genome Project whose initial deadline was the turn of the millennium in the year 2000. The term â€˜Big Dataâ€™, which seems to have its origins in computer graphics developed by Silicon Graphics for Hollywood special effects (Mashey, 1998) and econometrics around the same time (Diebold, 2003), span many arenas of human endeavor. Climate data span the globe, with NASA satellites sending back more than ten million gigbytes of data per year. The human genome contains 3 billion base pairs, so it was a decade-long effort to sequence it for one individual, but techniques have rapidly improved and now it can be done for any of the 7 billion individuals on the planet in less than an hour.

f07b7a0f930649e032d9113d018af8f97501e771,Glucocorticoid receptor gene variants and lower expression of NR3C1 are associated with cocaine use.,"Animal and cross-sectional human studies suggest that chronic cocaine use is associated with altered responsivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to stress. Moreover, increased susceptibility to stress has been proposed as an important factor for development, maintenance and relapse of cocaine addiction. As the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) mediates genomic effects of the stress hormone cortisol, we investigated NR3C1 expression and the association of NR3C1 genotypes with cocaine use, addiction and comorbid psychiatric symptoms in 126 chronic cocaine users and 98 stimulant-naÃ¯ve healthy controls. A comprehensive psychiatric assessment was performed including severity of depressive symptoms and current psychological distress. Whole blood NR3C1 mRNA levels were determined and six NR3C1 polymorphisms (rs10482605, rs41423247, rs10052957, rs6189, rs56149945 and rs6198) were genotyped. Compared to controls, cocaine users showed significantly lower NR3C1 expression (PÂ <Â 0.001), which was not affected by NR3C1 genotypes. In controls, rs41423247 [PÂ <Â 0.01, false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected], haplotype 2 and haplotype 3 (both PÂ <Â 0.05, FDR-corrected) were associated with altered NR3C1 gene expression. Haplotype 3 (including minor alleles of rs10052957 and rs41423247) was associated with an increased risk for cocaine addiction (odds ratioÂ =Â 2.74, PÂ <Â 0.05, uncorrected). Moreover, addicted cocaine users carrying haplotype 3 showed higher depression scores (PÂ <Â 0.01, FDR-corrected) than noncarriers. Considering possible confounding effects of alcohol and/or depression, we conclude that chronic cocaine use is associated with lower NR3C1 gene expression suggesting possible direct effects of the drug on the biological adaptation of stress-related genes. Finally, we postulate that haplotype 3 of NR3C1 might serve as a potential risk factor for stimulant addiction and associated psychiatric symptoms.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrea B Schote"", ids = ""6095848""); list(name = ""Kristina JÃ¤ger"", ids = ""41092397""); list(name = ""Sara L Kroll"", ids = ""4667415""); list(name = ""Matthias Vonmoos"", ids = ""6971677""); list(name = ""Lea M.

441f1c4b5a9443cee9d9d57469a6ab4fd215c490,Mapping Keratoconus Molecular Substrates by Multiplexed High-Resolution Proteomics of Unpooled Corneas.,"Keratoconus (KCN) is a leading cause for cornea grafting worldwide. Keratoconus is a multifactorial disease that causes progressive thinning of the cornea and whose etiology is poorly understood. Several studies have used proteomics on patient tear fluids to identify potential biomarkers. However, proteome of the cornea itself has not been investigated fully. We report here new findings from a case-control study using multiplexed mass spectrometry (MS) on individual (unpooled) corneas to gain deeper insights into proteins and biomarkers relevant to keratoconus. We employed a high-pressure approach to extract total protein from individual corneas from five cases and five controls, followed by trypsin digestion and tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling. The MS-derived data were searched using the Human NCBI RefSeq protein database v92, with peptides and proteins filtered at 1% false discovery rate. A total of 3132 proteins were detected, of which 627 were altered significantly (pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05) in keratoconus corneas. The increases were overwhelmingly in the mTOR/PI3/AKT signal-mediated regulations of cell survival and proliferation, nonsense-mediated decay of transcripts, and proteasomal pathways. The decreases were in several extracellular matrix proteins and in many members of the complement system. Importantly, this multiplexed proteomic study of keratoconus corneas identified, to our knowledge, the largest number of corneal proteins. The novel findings include changes in pathways that regulate transcript stability, proteasomal degradation, and the complement system in corneas with keratoconus. These observations offer new prospects toward future discovery of novel molecular targets for diagnostic and therapeutic innovations for patients with keratoconus.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Vishal N.

Peptide drift time prediction in IMMS will improve the confidence of peptide identification by limiting the peptide search space during MS/MS database searching and therefore reducing false discovery rate (FDR) of protein identification. A peptide drift time prediction method was proposed here using an artificial neural networks (ANN) regression model.

Signaling through these pathways is implicated in early breast cancer. A single-arm phase II pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study was conducted to confirm the inhibitory activity of enzastaurin on pGSK3\#946;, a critical component of these pathways. Secondary objectives included analysis of other key signaling nodes in the PKC and AKT signaling pathways including pS6 kinase, pCREB, and PKC\#946; II expression pre- and post-treatment. Pre- and post-treatment breast tumor biopsies were obtained after 21-28d 500 mg QD dosing (d1 loading dose of 1125 mg) of enzastaurin for IHC and RNA analysis. Plasma samples were collected after 18 days of dosing to evaluate the steady-state exposures of enzastaurin and its active metabolite. Enzastaurin was well tolerated in the 39 pts enrolled with mostly grade 1 and 2 toxicities except for 1 pt with grade 3 transaminase elevation. Paired samples from 19 pts were suitable for IHC evaluation (had a pre- and post-treatment pGSK3\#946; IHC score). Baseline characteristics included ER (14 positive), PR (9 positive), and Her2 status (2 positive). IHC was performed using Benchmark-XT automated immunostainers with validated assays (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) for pGSK3\#946;, pS6 kinase, pCREB, and PKC\#946; II . IHC was scored by a single pathologist who was blinded to pre/post biopsy samples and clinical information and an H-(histo) score was determined. Enzastaurin significantly decreased pGSK3\#946; ( p = 0.019), pS6 ( p = 0.014), and PKC\#946; II ( p = 0.037) H-scores in the post-treatment biopsies. Steady-state average concentrations for enzastaurin and total analytes (sum of enzastaurin and its metabolite) were 706 nmol/L (94.6% CV) and 1500 nmol/L (52.2% CV), respectively. No correlations between individual patient exposures to enzastaurin and metabolite with pGSK3\#946;, pS6 or PKC\#946; II inhibition were seen, however the exposures achieved were in the range of the target plasma concentrations of 1400 nmol/L for total analytes. Gene expression was analyzed by Affymetrix H133+2 microarrays and compared with genes known to be modulated by enzastaurin in breast cancer cell lines (SKBR3 and MDA-MB231). Although no significant gene changes (FDR [false discovery rate] =.05 or .01 and fold change \#8805; 2) were observed in the overall sample group, common genes were identified as modulated by enzastaurin between the tumors and the breast cancer cell lines (e.g. RARRES3, MMP1, THRSP/SPOT14, STEAP4, TNFSF10Lig). Of interest in the triple negative group (n=2), elevation of death receptor family members was observed and is consistent with other pre-clinical models of enzastaurin activity. This study is the first in vivo, pharmacodynamic demonstration within tumor samples from pts treated with the PKC and AKT pathway inhibitor enzastaurin.

7075f99e329bfac6a945b5296a22533e8edece0b,A genome-wide association study for feed efficiency-related traits in a crossbred pig population.,"Feed efficiency (FE) is one of the most important traits in pig production. However, it is difficult and costly to measure it, limiting the collection of large amount of data for an accurate selection for better FE. Therefore, the identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with FE-related traits to be used in the genetic evaluation is of great interest of pig breeding programs for increasing the prediction accuracy and the genetic progress of these traits. The objective of this study was to identify SNPs significantly associated with FE-related traits: average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). We also aimed to identify potential candidate genes for these traits. Phenotypic information recorded on a population of 2386 three-way crossbreed pigs that were genotyped for 51 468 SNPs was used. We identified three loci of quantitative trait (QTL) regions associated with ADG and three QTL regions associated with ADFI; however, no significant association was found for FCR. A false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤ 0.005 was used as the threshold for declaring an association as significant. The QTL regions associated with ADG on Sus scrofa chromosome (SSC) 1 were located between 177.01 and 185.47 Mb, which overlaps with the QTL regions for ADFI on SSC1 (173.26 and 185.47 Mb). The other QTL region for ADG was located on SSC12 (2.87 and 3.22 Mb). The most significant SNPs in these QTL regions explained up to 3.26% of the phenotypic variance of these traits. The non-identification of genomic regions associated with FCR can be explained by the complexity of this trait, which is a ratio between ADG and ADFI. Finally, the genes CDH19, CDH7, RNF152, MC4R, PMAIP1, FEM1B and GAA were the candidate genes found in the 1 Mb window around the QTL regions identified in this study. Among them, the MC4R gene (SSC1) has a well-known function related to ADG and ADFI. In this study, we identified three QTL regions for ADG (SSC1 and SSC12) and three for ADFI (SSC1). These regions were previously described in purebred pig populations; however, to our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm the relevance of these QTL regions in a crossbred pig population. The potential use of the SNPs and genes identified in this study in prediction models that combine genomic selection and marker-assisted selection should be evaluated for increasing the prediction accuracy of these traits in this population.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ã‰rika Ferreira Silva"", ids = ""90208849""); list(name = ""M S Lopes"", ids = ""14678388""); list(name = ""Paulo SÃ¡vio Lopes"", ids = ""143836988""); list(name = ""Eliane Gasparino"", ids = ""90226826"")",,,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,,"

As the nascent idea of precision medicine expands to encompass epigenetic signatures of diagnostic and prognostic relevance, there is a need for methodologies that provide high-throughput DNA methylation profiling measurements. Here we report a novel quantification methodology for computationally reconstructing site-specific CpG methylation status from next generation sequencing (NGS) data using methyl-sensitive restriction endonucleases (MSRE). An integrated pipeline efficiently incorporates raw NGS metrics into a statistical discrimination platform to identify functional linkages between shifts in epigenetic DNA methylation and disease phenotypes in samples being analyzed. In this pilot proof-of-concept study we quantify and compare DNA methylation in blood serum of individuals with Parkinson's Disease relative to matched healthy blood profiles. Even with a small study of only six samples, a high degree of statistical discrimination was achieved based on CpG methylation profiles between groups, with 1008 statistically different CpG sites (p < 0.0025, after false discovery rate correction). A methylation load calculation was used to assess higher order impacts of methylation shifts on genes and pathways and most notably identified FGF3, FGF8, HTT, KMTA5, MIR8073, and YWHAG as differentially methylated genes with high relevance to Parkinson's Disease and neurodegeneration (based on PubMed literature citations). Of these, KMTA5 is a histone methyl-transferase gene and HTT is Huntington Disease Protein or Huntingtin, for which there are well established neurodegenerative impacts. The future need for precision diagnostics now requires more tools for exploring epigenetic processes that may be linked to cellular dysfunction and subsequent disease progression.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Adam G.

9d655b656be2a86abb0ef945c433ad756a3ec412,Does AL Amyloidosis Have Unique Gene Expression Profile? Meta-Analysis Results,"Background Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL amyloidosis) is a plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by deposition of amyloid fibrils in various organs and tissues, derived from monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains (LC), leading to organ dysfunction. Until now there is no systematic study of genomic expression of patients with AL amyloidosis compared to other monoclonal gammopathies. Aim of this study was to reveal genomic expression differences between AL amyloidosis patients versus healthy donors (ND), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smouldering myeloma (SMM) and multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Methods Gene expression profiling data from GEO database (GSE6477, GSE24128) comprised of ND (n=15), MGUS (n=21), SMM (n=24), MM (n=69) and AL (n=16) patients were used. To ensure the comparability between arrays and eliminate the batch effect, quantile normalization was performed. To identify the AL patientsÂ´ gene expression profile which significantly differs in comparison with ND, MGUS, SMM or MM patients, we applied SAM algorithm for 6588 selected genes that fulfilled the condition having standard deviation above the median. Genes with fold change â‰¥1.5 or â‰¤0.5 and false discovery rate >0.001 were considered as significant. Prediction analysis of microarrays (PAM) using nearest shrunken centroids and cross validation assay was carried out to identify the smallest subsets of genes that were able to accurately predict classes. Results Comparison of AL patients vs. ND revealed 229 changed genes, AL vs. MGUS 126 genes, AL vs. SMM 338 genes and AL vs. MM 110 genes, respectively. Out of them, the most significantly changed 100 genes from each comparison were further analysed. Some of the genes occurred repeatedly, thus only 256 of genes from all comparisons were unique. Using PAM algorithm we found the genes that have the best predictive power for differentiation AL patients from ND, MGUS, SMM and from MM patients was as followed: RPS6, RPS14, RPS17, RPLA18A, TMEM66, EIF3L, CCDC72, GLTSCR2, NDUFS6, DUSP1, IGLJ3, IGHM, IGKV1-5IGKC///IGKV1-5///IGKV1D-8 and IGHA1///IGHA2///IGHD///IGHG1///IGHG3///IGHG4///IGHM/// IGHV3-23///IGHV4-31///IGHV4-59. Gene expression changes are presented on Figure 1. Conclusion Based on offered meta-analysis, 16 genes representing mostly ribosomal proteins and immunoglobulin regions allow us to detect specific aberrant clone responsible for pre-amyloid production and can serve as candidates for further detailed study.

And the probability of observing atleast one significant result simply due to chance keeps going up with the increase of number of tests. Numerous methods have been developed to control type the error rates; the family-wise error rate (FWER) and the false discovery rate (FDR) have been proposed as suitable significance criteria to perform the multiple testing adjustment while still keen to high statistical power. The problem is even complex when such hypotheses have dependency. Most commonly used methods that assume independence are compared in this study. We calculate FWER, FDR with adjusted p values developed by Benjamini and Hochberg, the false non-discovery rate and statistical power in a simulation study with various correlation structure. Based on intuition we expect power to be increasing as correlation increases, however, all the methods fail to improve the quantities with the increase of correlation values that suggest to improve or develop new method for testing dependent multiple tests. 1313 W.

We estimated the effect of these SNPs on incident CHD, stroke and total mortality in the prospective cohorts of the MORGAM Project. We studied cohorts from Finland, Sweden, France and Northern Ireland (total N=33,282, including 1,436 incident CHD events and 571 incident stroke events). The lead SNPs at seven loci identified thus far and additional SNPs (in total 42) were genotyped using a case-cohort design. We estimated the effect of the SNPs on disease history at baseline, disease events during follow-up and classic risk factors. Multiple testing was taken into account using false discovery rate (FDR) analysis. SNP rs1333049 on chromosome 9p21.3 was associated with both CHD and stroke (HR=1.20, 95% CI 1.08-1.34 for incident CHD events and 1.15, 0.99-1.34 for incident stroke). SNP rs11670734 (19q12) was associated with total mortality and stroke. SNP rs2146807 (10q11.21) showed some association with the fatality of acute coronary event. SNP rs2943634 (2q36.3) was associated with high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and SNPs rs599839, rs4970834 (1p13.3) and rs17228212 (15q22.23) were associated with non-HDL cholesterol. SNPs rs2943634 (2q36.3) and rs12525353 (6q25.1) were associated with blood pressure.

8a865456171befacaabf5b1815859a630b230962,Transcriptomic Profiling of Virus-Host Cell Interactions following Chicken Anaemia Virus (CAV) Infection in an In Vivo Model,"Chicken Anaemia Virus (CAV) is an economically important virus that targets lymphoid and erythroblastoid progenitor cells leading to immunosuppression. This study aimed to investigate the interplay between viral infection and the host's immune response to better understand the pathways that lead to CAV-induced immunosuppression. To mimic vertical transmission of CAV in the absence of maternally-derived antibody, day-old chicks were infected and their responses measured at various time-points post-infection by qRT-PCR and gene expression microarrays. The kinetics of mRNA expression levels of signature cytokines of innate and adaptive immune responses were determined by qRT-PCR. The global gene expression profiles of mock-infected (control) and CAV-infected chickens at 14 dpi were also compared using a chicken immune-related 5K microarray. Although in the thymus there was evidence of induction of an innate immune response following CAV infection, this was limited in magnitude. There was little evidence of a Th1 adaptive immune response in any lymphoid tissue, as would normally be expected in response to viral infection. Most cytokines associated with Th1, Th2 or Treg subsets were down-regulated, except IL-2, IL-13, IL-10 and IFNÎ³, which were all up-regulated in thymus and bone marrow. From the microarray studies, genes that exhibited significant (greater than 1.5-fold, false discovery rate <0.05) changes in expression in thymus and bone marrow on CAV infection were mainly associated with T-cell receptor signalling, immune response, transcriptional regulation, intracellular signalling and regulation of apoptosis. Expression levels of a number of adaptor proteins, such as src-like adaptor protein (SLA), a negative regulator of T-cell receptor signalling and the transcription factor Special AT-rich Binding Protein 1 (SATB1), were significantly down-regulated by CAV infection, suggesting potential roles for these genes as regulators of viral infection or cell defence. These results extend our understanding of CAV-induced immunosuppression and suggest a global immune dysregulation following CAV infection.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Efstathios S Giotis"", ids = ""3686723""); list(name = ""Lisa Rothwell"", ids = ""4871559""); list(name = ""Alistair N Scott"", ids = ""144852228""); list(name = ""Tuanjun Hu"", ids = ""5021756""); list(name = ""Richard Talbot"", ids = ""145473556""); list(name = ""Daniel Todd"", ids = ""145504521""); list(name = ""David W.

To optimize treatment for individual patients, identification of subgroups most likely to benefit from a specific therapy is important. The international, randomized, phase 3 LYM3001 study in patients with relapsed or refractory FL demonstrated improved PFS with bortezomib-rituximab vs rituximab alone (median 12.8 vs 11.0 months, HR 0.822, p=0.039), plus increased overall response rate (ORR; 63% vs 49%, p=0.0004), complete response rate (CR/CRu; 25% vs 18%, p=0.035), and durable (â‰¥6 months) response rate (50% vs 38%, p=0.002) in an unselected patient population. Here we present exploratory biomarker analyses aimed at identifying patient subgroups deriving a longer PFS benefit with bortezomib-rituximab and showing a trend for better OS. Methods: Patients received five 5-week cycles of bortezomib-rituximab (N=336) or rituximab (N=340). Response was assessed using modified International Working Group response criteria. Archived tumor tissue was collected at baseline from 502 (74%) patients; whole blood samples for germ-line DNA were collected on day 1 of cycle 1 from 619 (92%) patients. Protocol-specified candidate biomarkers were based on associations with bortezomib (NF-ÎºB p65, PSMA5, p27, PSMB1/5/8/9) or rituximab (CD68, FCGR2A/3A) activity. Immunohistochemistry assays were used for protein analysis. Taqman SNP assays and PCR/LDR were used for genotyping. Statistical analyses included single-marker analyses, pair-wise combination analyses (n=1140 comparisons), and multiple comparison analyses of all evaluable patients in LYM3001. Clinical covariates included in the analysis were baseline FLIPI score, prior rituximab, time since last anti-lymphoma therapy, region, age, gender, race, Ann Arbor stage, high tumor burden, and number of prior lines of therapy. Results: Single markers and biomarker pairs (n=102) highlighted patient subsets that had significantly improved outcomes with bortezomib-rituximab vs rituximab. For 14 of the pairs, the PFS benefit was â‰¥6 months. Using false discovery rate (FDR) to control for multiple comparison corrections, one biomarker pair was significant. This pair (presence of the PSMB1 P11A C/G heterozygote, and low CD68 expression [0â€“50 CD68-positive macrophages in the follicular space]) was associated with significantly improved PFS in patients receiving bortezomib-rituximab vs rituximab (median 16.6 vs 9.1 months, HR 0.407, p 2 prior lines of therapy). There was also a trend towards an OS benefit (medians not reached, HR 0.426, p=0.0550), as well as a significantly higher ORR (73.7% vs 47.5%, p=0.0077), a higher CR rate (33.3% vs 23%, p=0.3044), and a significantly longer time to next therapy (median 33.1 vs 14.8 months, p=0.0013). In patients lacking this biomarker pair (N=238) no significant efficacy differences were seen. No other similar studies were available to confirm the reproducibility of these analyses. Therefore, we split the LYM3001 dataset into discovery and confirmation cohorts (7:3 ratio of biomarker-evaluable patients) to enable evaluation and confirmation in independent cohorts of patients The significant biomarker pair of PSMB1 P11A C/G heterozygote and low CD68 was identified in the discovery cohort (N=198) with a PFS advantage with bortezomib-rituximab vs rituximab of 5.7 months (median 14.2 vs 8.4 months, p=0.0003) and an indication of longer OS (HR 0.47, p=0.1291). This biomarker pair also showed a clear PFS advantage in the confirmation cohort (N=108, 8.7-month PFS benefit; median 18.2 vs 9.5 months, HR 0.44, p=0.0817). Other significant biomarker combinations, including combinations of molecular and clinical variables (e.g. high tumor burden) were identified and will be presented. Conclusions: Analyses of the phase 3 LYM3001 trial identified biomarker combinations present in a third of patients offering a significant PFS benefit with bortezomib-rituximab vs rituximab. Use of such biomarker assays in patients with relapsed or refractory FL may aid identification of subgroups deriving maximal benefit from the addition of bortezomib to rituximab therapy.

Large scale genomic initiatives are mapping the genetic diversity in GPCRs, however, a map of which GPCR genetic variants are associated with phenotypic variation and disease is lacking. Furthermore, the mechanistic basis of how the individual GPCR genetic variants regulate molecular function is also largely unknown. We performed a phenome-wide association analysis for 269 common protein-altering variants in 156 GPCRs and 275 phenotypes using data from 337,205 unrelated white British UK Biobank participants and identified 138 associations at a false discovery rate of 5%. We found a novel association between rs12295710 in MRGPRE, a member of the Mas-related receptor family involved in nociception, and migraine risk. We also identified an association between rs3732378, a missense mutation in the binding pocket of CX3CR1, and hypothyroidism. Five orphan GPCRs had eight genetic associations, highlighting novel biology for these receptors of unknown function. We found several associations between GPCR variants and food intake phenotypes, including an association between the variants in TAS2R38 known to affect the ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide and tea intake as well as a non-additive associations between variants in TAS2R19 and TAS2R31 and coffee and tea intake. Finally, we tested whether genetic variants in ADRB2 associated with immune cell amounts and pulmonary function affect downstream signaling pathways and found that two ADRB2 haplotypes are associated with differential signaling relative to the most common haplotype. Overall, this study provides a map of genetic associations for GPCR coding variants across a wide variety of phenotypes that can inform future drug discovery efforts targeting GPCRs.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Christopher M.

Here we studied differentially expressed coding and non-coding genes in relation to SSc pathogenesis with a specific focus on antisense non-coding RNAs. Materials and methods Skin biopsy-derived RNAs from fourteen early SSc patients and six healthy individuals were sequenced with ion-torrent and analysed using DEseq2. Protein-coding and non-coding genes annotated in GENCODEV7 were analysed. Significant long non-coding RNAs were independently replicated in a Northern American dataset. Results 4901 genes with a fold change >1.5 and a false discovery rate of less than 5% were detected in patients versus controls. Upregulated coding genes clustered in immunological, cell adhesion and keratin-related processes as previously found by microarray studies. Interestingly, 676 deregulated non-coding genes were detected, 257 of which were classified as antisense genes. 42% of these antisense genes had a concurrent deregulated sense gene. The majority of the sense-antisense genes had a similar effect sizes in an independent North American dataset with three genes (OTUD6B-AS1, CTBP1-AS2 and HMGN3-AS1) exceeding the study-wide Bonferroni-corrected &rgr;-value (PBonf <0.0024, Pcombined=1.6Ã—10-9, 1.7 Ã— 10â€“6, 2.6 Ã— 10â€“6, respectively). Intriguingly, the correlation of sense-antisense gene pairs deregulated in SSc is stronger than sense-antisense gene pairs not deregulated in SSc (p<0.001).

A population-based case-control study0259 Interaction between genetic and occupational factors in lung cancer aetiology. A population-based case-control study,"Objectives Genetic susceptibility in work-related lung cancer aetiology could have an important public health impact. Few studies have previously evaluated this issue, with inconsistent results. We aimed to investigate interactions between exposure to occupational carcinogens and genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer aetiology, adopting a systematic integrated approach. Method EAGLE, a population-based case-control study, enrolled 2100 lung cancer cases and 2120 controls (Italy, 2002â€“2005). Lifetime work histories were collected for 4059 subjects and translated into exposure to six occupational carcinogens (asbestos, silica, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, diesel exhausts, chromium, and nickel) using a job-exposure matrix. We selected 23 candidate genes among phase II metabolic genes reported in association with lung cancer susceptibility and/or metabolism of selected carcinogens. 298 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped on 4050 subjects. We tested for interaction within smoking-adjusted logistic regressions where SNPs were modelled individually, by gene group (using gene scores and haplotypes), and by pathways. False discovery rate (FDR) was used to account for multiple testing. Gene expression changes in lung tissues were studied for SNPs-carcinogens significant interactions. Results As asbestos had the highest impact on lung cancer burden, we restricted interaction tests to this carcinogen. GSTM4 polymorphisms consistently showed positive interactions across different analysis levels, especially by SNP group score (FDR-adjusted p-value for interaction Conclusions GSTM4 polymorphisms may play a role in asbestos-related lung cancer aetiology.

eb5f42ef53c8f23b72cb925ceb862452d3576040,Abstract LB-344: Senescence-related genes signature in high grade gliomas,"Background: The prognosis of high grade gliomas (HGG) worsens with the age of the patients. We hypothesized that overexpression of senescence-related genes indicates a poorer prognosis. Materials and Methods: Frozen tumor samples from 60 patients of different ages (32 to 88 years) with the histologic diagnosis of HGG were macrodissected and arrayed on a custom version of the Affymetrix HG-U133 + GeneChip. There were 29 events (deaths) with a median survival time of 20 months. A set of 14 known senescence-associated genes (SAGs) including CCL2, CCL7, CDKN1A, COPG, CSF2RB, CXCL1, ICAM1, IGFBP3, IL6, IL8, SAA4, TNFRSF11B, TNFSF11 and TP53 were the focus of the study (Campisi J. et al. PLoS Biology, 2008). An overall senescence score was generated using principal component analysis to reflect the combined effect of the senescence-associated gene signature. Pearson correlation and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to examine the association of each SAG and the senescence score with age at onset and overall patient survival. False discovery rate was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Results: We found an age-related gradient in the senescence score representation of the combined SAGs (r = 0.40; p=0.0014). Ten SAGs were significantly correlated with age (false discovery rate at 5%): IGFBP3 (r=0.44), ICAM1 (r=0.40), IL6 (r=0.38), CDKN1A (r=0.35), TNFSF11 (r=0.34), TP53 (r=0.34), CXCL1 (r=0.31), CCL7 (r=0.30), COPG (r=0.29), and CSF2RB (r=0.29). The SAG signature was also correlated with poor prognosis (p=0.0098; median survival: 13 and 28 months, respectively, for high versus low senescence score). Two SAGs were significantly associated with patient survival: IL6 (14 versus 38 months) and COPG (13 versus 38 months). Conclusion: We report for the first time an SAG signature in HGG associated with age at onset and patient outcome. This signature composed of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis may define a more aggressive subtype of high-grade glioma.

2073e1c897a6067c662f6889b815427555e1395c,Bayesian Multiple Hypothesis Testing For Distributed Detection In Sensor Networks,"In this paper we present a method for multiple hypothesis testing in sensor networks. Standard multiple testing methods ignore spatial dependencies between sensors, and thus suffer from a drastic loss of detection sensitivity. We introduce a Bayesian approach for taking the underlying spatial structure into account. By assigning a Gaus-sian process prior to a latent variable over the field, we locate areas where most of the received test statistics are caused by true signals. In these regions we relax the significance threshold in a manner which improves detection sensitivity while controlling overall false discovery rate at a tolerated level. The proposed method requires only minimal assumptions, but allows the user to incorporate their possible prior knowledge in to the model to refine inference.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a common chronic disease with onset before the 16 years old in a child. Polyarticular JIA has been reported as the main form of JIA in several locations. Until now, understanding of the genetic basis of JIA is incomplete. The purpose of this study was to identify pathway pairs of great potential functional relevance in the progression of polyarticular JIA.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microarray data of 59 peripheral blood samples from healthy children and 61 samples from polyarticular JIA were transformed to gene expression data. Differential expressed genes (DEG) between patients and normal controls were identified using Linear Models for Microarray Analysis. After performed enrichment of DEG, differential pathways were identified with Fisher's test and false discovery rate. Differential pathway pairs were constructed with random two differential pathways, and were evaluated by Random Forest classification. Monte Carlo Cross-Validation was introduced to screen the best pathway pair.


RESULTS
42 DEG with P-values<0.01 were identified. 19 differential pathways with P-values<0.01 were identified. Area under the curve (AUC) of pathway pairs was generated with RF classification. After 50 bootstraps of Monte Carlo Cross-Validation, the best pathway pair with the highest AUC value was identified, and it was the pair of tumoricidal function of hepatic natural killer cells pathway and erythropoietin signaling pathway.


CONCLUSION
These identified pathway pairs may play pivotal roles in the progress of polyarticular JIA and can be applied for diagnosis. Particular attention can be focused on them for further research.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shunhua Lin"", ids = ""8600651""); list(name = ""Yuanji Wang"", ids = ""7708532""); list(name = ""Shunmei Mu"", ids = ""12386465""); list(name = ""Junxi Zhang"", ids = ""49050774""); list(name = ""F.

2942a6e9388b2a6963032ad53a86f3e49ebc7176,Automated segmentation of geographic atrophy in fundus autofluorescence images using supervised pixel classification,"Abstract. Geographic atrophy (GA) is a manifestation of the advanced or late stage of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is the leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 65 in the western world. The purpose of this study is to develop a fully automated supervised pixel classification approach for segmenting GA, including uni- and multifocal patches in fundus autofluorescene (FAF) images. The image features include region-wise intensity measures, gray-level co-occurrence matrix measures, and Gaussian filter banks. A k-nearest-neighbor pixel classifier is applied to obtain a GA probability map, representing the likelihood that the image pixel belongs to GA. Sixteen randomly chosen FAF images were obtained from 16 subjects with GA. The algorithm-defined GA regions are compared with manual delineation performed by a certified image reading center grader. Eight-fold cross-validation is applied to evaluate the algorithm performance. The mean overlap ratio (OR), area correlation (Pearsonâ€™s r), accuracy (ACC), true positive rate (TPR), specificity (SPC), positive predictive value (PPV), and false discovery rate (FDR) between the algorithm- and manually defined GA regions are 0.72Â±0.03, 0.98Â±0.02, 0.94Â±0.00, 0.87Â±0.01, 0.96Â±0.01, 0.80Â±0.04, and 0.20Â±0.04, respectively.",2015,Engineering; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhihong Hu"", ids = ""40276556""); list(name = ""GÃ©rard G.

9a65e9f6a96b5dca52edde1eb31dc01ed6c3214c,On estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses for false discovery rate controlling procedures in exploratory DNA microarray studies,"Abstract Multiple testing using DNA microarray gene expression data has revived the promising area of false discovery rate (FDR) in statistics. Some recent advances in FDR controlling procedures can be unified in terms of estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses, Ï€ 0 . In the original FDR procedure Ï€ 0 was set to its upper bound of one, the most conservative choice. The degree of conservativeness in estimating Ï€ 0 has a direct impact on the power of FDR procedures to detect true alternative hypotheses. In this work, we examine some recent FDR procedures with respect to the following two primary aims: (1) Compare the conservativeness of estimating Ï€ 0 (and hence FDR). (2) Evaluate the impact of (1) on the power to detect true alternative hypotheses. We also investigate the sensitivity of FDR procedures to violation of statistical assumptions, such as heterogeneity of variance and independence. The effect of varying sample sizes on the estimation of Ï€ 0 and power is also explored. Furthermore, in our investigation of aims (1) and (2), we defined and utilized the benchmark FDR procedure. This allows for making absolute power comparisons of FDR procedures to a benchmark, in addition to making relative comparisons among FDR procedures.",2004,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Danh V.

We conducted transcriptome profiling of M. salmoides to understand the host immune response to N. seriolae infection, using the Illumina sequencing platform. De novo assembly of paired-end reads yielded 47,881 unigenes, the total length, average length, N50, and GC content of which were 49,734,288, 1038, 1983 bp, and 45.94%, respectively. Annotation was performed by comparison against non-redundant protein sequence (NR), non-redundant nucleotide (NT), Swiss-Prot, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Ontology (GO), and Interpro databases, yielding 28,964 (NR: 60.49%), 36,686 (NT: 76.62%), 24,830 (Swissprot: 51.86%), 8913 (COG: 18.61%), 20,329 (KEGG: 42.46%), 835 (GO: 1.74%), and 22,194 (Interpro: 46.35%) unigenes. Additionally, 8913 unigenes were classified into 25 Clusters of Orthologous Groups (KOGs) categories, and 20,329 unigenes were assigned to 244 specific signalling pathways. RNA-Seq by Expectation Maximization (RSEM) and PossionDis were used to determine significantly differentially expressed genes (False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05) and we found that 1384 were upregulated genes and 1542 were downregulated genes, and further confirmed their regulations using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).

e84ee4c61938f5024cf02a55deeddadd92016e77,51 Bovine embryos with distinct early morphokinetic pathways present different post-embryonic genome activation transcriptomic patterns and different cryotolerance,"We recently developed and validated a methodology based on early morphokinetics to predict 6 categories of bovine embryos, including 4 categories of blastocysts: early hatching blastocysts (EHB), hatching blastocysts (HB), low hatching blastocysts (LHB), and arrhythmic blastocysts (AB) (Reis et al. 2018 Anim. Reprod. 15, 601). We hypothesised that different early morphokinetic pathways could (1) be accompanied by different biological patterns (EGA, etc.) and (2) influence interaction with environmental constraints (cryopreservation, etc.). The objective of this study was (1) to investigate whether transcriptomic differences between the predicted EHB, HB, LHB, or AB could be observed immediately after the fourth embryonic cycle (just after EGA); (2) to assess cryotolerance of these morphokinetic categories. Time lapses were produced during 4 days post inâ€‰vitro insemination (dpi) (Reis et al. 2018). Study 1: 128 embryos having finished the fourth embryonic cycle were individually dry frozen at 4.7 dpi, classified as EHB, HB, LHB, or AB, and pooled into four batches of eight embryos/category (total 16 samples). Total RNA was extracted, amplified using the SMARTseq V4 ultralow input kit (Clontech), libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT Illumina library preparation kit, and sequenced (paired-end 50-34â€‰bp) on an Illumina NextSEqn 500 instrument. Identification of differentially expressed genes was achieved using Limma package (R). The P-values were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (Saenz-de-Juano et al. 2014). Fold change >2 or 135â€‰Âµm and âˆ’2â€‰Âµm at zona pellucida) were slow frozen at 6.2 or 7 dpi, classified as EHB (nâ€‰=â€‰8), HB (nâ€‰=â€‰29), LHB (nâ€‰=â€‰32), or AB (nâ€‰=â€‰21), and further thawed and cultured inâ€‰vitro for 72â€‰h. Cryotolerance was evaluated at 24 and 72â€‰h post-thawing. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square or Fisher test. Study 1: the AB category presented 258, 699, and 899 upregulated genes and 40, 62, and 60 downregulated in comparison to LHB, HB, and EHB, respectively. The functional comparison of the two extremes (EHB vs. AB), at 4.7 dpi, showed that AB embryos present intense transcription regulation activity. The monocarboxylic acid binding pathway was upregulated in EHB. Study 2: the post-thawing inâ€‰vitro survival was similar between EHB, HB, LHB, and AB (50%, 34.5%, 31.3%, and 42.9%, respectively). The hatching/alive ratio in EHB category tended to be lower than AB (1/4 vs. 8/9; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.052). Frozen/thawed EHB and HB presented reduced hatching rates, whereas LHB and AB significantly increased the hatching potential after thawing compared with their not-frozen counterparts of the learning database (25% vs. 100%; 50% vs. 100%; 70% vs. 11%; 88.9% vs. 18%, respectively). Morphokinetic prediction highlighted a new classification of bovine embryos with different biological features. This could contribute to improve practice on IVF embryo transfer taking into account these differences.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""A. P. Reis"", ids = ""153501513""); list(name = ""A.

448212f67249435705bb9b945406b19807da6a98,False Discovery Rate,"For the multiple hypotheses testing problem consider the proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses (false discoveries) among the total number of rejections. The expected value of this proportion, called the False Discovery Rate (FDR), is a useful criterion to control as an alternative to the traditional familywise error rate (FWE) that suffers from low power properties when the number of tested hypotheses is large. In a way, controlling FDR is adaptively inbetween ignoring multiplicity altogether and a conservative control of FWE. Several FDR controlling procedures are presented and others are reviewed. Various extensions and applications of the FDR are discussed.

28efb1871c112a88df181f68fdd892956624b6a4,Methylomics of gene expression in human monocytes.,"DNA methylation is one of several epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of gene expression; however, the extent to which methylation of CpG dinucleotides correlates with gene expression at the genome-wide level is still largely unknown. Using purified primary monocytes from subjects in a large community-based cohort (n = 1264), we characterized methylation (>485 000 CpG sites) and mRNA expression (>48K transcripts) and carried out genome-wide association analyses of 8370 expression phenotypes. We identified 11 203 potential cis-acting CpG loci whose degree of methylation was associated with gene expression (eMS) at a false discovery rate threshold of 0.001. Most of the associations were consistent in effect size and direction of effect across sex and three ethnicities. Contrary to expectation, these eMS were not predominately enriched in promoter regions, or CpG islands, but rather in the 3' UTR, gene bodies, CpG shores or 'offshore' sites, and both positive and negative correlations between methylation and expression were observed across all locations. eMS were enriched for regions predicted to be regulatory by ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) data in multiple cell types, particularly enhancers. One of the strongest association signals detected (P < 2.2 Ã— 10(-308)) was a methylation probe (cg17005068) in the promoter/enhancer region of the glutathione S-transferase theta 1 gene (GSTT1, encoding the detoxification enzyme) with GSTT1 mRNA expression. Our study provides a detailed description of the epigenetic architecture in human monocytes and its relationship to gene expression. These data may help prioritize interrogation of biologically relevant methylation loci and provide new insights into the epigenetic basis of human health and diseases.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yongmei Liu"", ids = ""29330476""); list(name = ""Jingzhong Ding"", ids = ""2171224""); list(name = ""Lindsay M Reynolds"", ids = ""34738609""); list(name = ""Kurt Lohman"", ids = ""47474803""); list(name = ""Thomas C.

To understand the molecular immune mechanisms underlying the response to Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a comparative gene transcription analysis were performed with utilized fresh livers of V. parahaemolyticus-immunized Sparus macrocephlus with a control group through RNA-Seq technology. A total of 256663 contigs were obtained after excluded the low-quality sequences and assembly. The average length of contigs collected from this research is 1066.93 bp. Furthermore, blast analysis indicates 30747 contigs were annotated based on homology with matches in the NT, NR, gene, and string databases. A gene ontology analysis was employed to classify 21598 genes according to three major functional categories: molecular function, cellular component, and biological process. A total of 14470 genes were discovered in 303 KEGG pathways. RSEM and EdgeR were introduced to estimate 3841 genes significantly different expressed (False Discovery Rate<0.001) which includes 4072 up-regulated genes and 3771 down-regulated genes. A significant enrichment analysis of these differentially expressed genes and isogenes were conducted to reveal the major immune-related pathways which refer to the toll-like receptor, complement, coagulation cascades, and chemokine signaling pathways. In addition, 92175 potential simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 121912 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected and identified sequencely in the Sparus macrocephlus liver transcriptome. This research characterized a gene expression pattern for normal and the V. parahaemolyticus -immunized Sparus macrocephlus for the first time and not only sheds new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the host-V. parahaemolyticus interaction but contribute to facilitate future studies on Sparus macrocephlus gene expression and functional genomics.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xing-Wei Xiang"", ids = ""49659205""); list(name = ""Jin-Xing Xiao"", ids = ""51319595""); list(name = ""Yu-fang Zhou"", ids = ""51318564""); list(name = ""Bin Zheng"", ids = ""144055224""); list(name = ""Zheng-Shun Wen"", ids = ""6091838"")",,,Fish & shellfish immunology,84,"

d599cfb2dbf6229294d1737c842d9bdbac006b4f,Gene expression changes in patients with fulminant type 1 diabetes.,"BACKGROUND
Fulminant type 1 diabetes (F1D) is a complex disease. Microarray analysis was used to identify gene expression changes and obtain understanding of the underlying mechanisms.


METHODS
Microarray analysis was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from six F1D patients and six matched healthy subjects. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to verify the differentially expressed genes. NK cell activity was detected by methyl thiazoleterazolium assay.


RESULTS
Microarray analysis identified 759 genes differing in expression between F1D patients and controls at a false discovery rate of 0.05. Expression of TLR9, ELF4 and IL1RAP were verified and consistent with changes in microarray results. NK cell activity was decreased in F1D. With use of a knowledge base, differentially expressed genes could be placed within different pathways with predicted functions including interleukin-1, and tumor necrosis factor-Î± signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
These results identify several genes indicating possible mechanisms in F1D.

Placental DNA methylation is thought to be influenced by environmental exposure. Decidual natural killer cells (dNKs) directly contact with cytotrophoblasts in the early stage of pregnancy. dNKs may affect DNA methylation of extravillous cytotrophoblasts (EVTs) directly or indirectly through their secreted soluble factors.


OBJECTIVES
Previously, we showed that EVT outgrowth and migration on collagen gel were restricted by exposure to dNK or dNK-derived conditioned medium (dNK-CM) (ref [1]). The aim of this study was to determine if EVT DNA methylation was altered by treating with dNK or dNK-CM.


METHODS
Placental explants collected from 6 first-trimester healthy pregnancy terminations were cultured on a rat collagen gel model. Outgrowth EVTs from each subject were treated with medium or concordant dNK (trapped inside of hollow fibers) or dNK-CM. EVTs were harvested after 96-hour co-culturing and underwent DNA extraction. DNA methylation was quantified using the Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip, which targets over 450,000 CpG sites in the human genome. Differential methylation was defined by having p<0.05 (Student's t-test) and average DNA methylation change >10% before and after treatments. Functional enrichment was assessed by gene ontology analysis with False Discovery Rate <10% defined as significantly enriched.


RESULTS
Increased DNA methylation was observed for 360 loci and 572 loci by dNK or dNK-CM respectively, and decreased DNA methylation was shown for 62 loci and 188 loci by dNK or dNK-CM respectively. DNA methylation at 44 loci was altered by both dNK and dNK-CM. The common loci were overrepresented for associations with EVT differentiation, adhesion and migration. Examples of the relevant overlapped loci with increased DNA methylations were MYO15A and PRDM16 (PR domain zinc finger protein 16); and the overlapped loci with reduced DNA methylation were CDH9 and USP29 (ubiquitin specific protein 29). dNK but not dNK-CM reduced IL18 methylation and increased methylation on ITGAL (integrin, alpha L) and ITGB7. dNK-CM but not dNK reduced methylation of ITGAD and PCDH8 (protocadherin 8) and increased methylation of CDH4 and CDH6.


CONCLUSION
DNA methylation of EVT was altered by exposure to surrounding dNK and their secreted soluble molecules. These results serve as a basis for further investigations on whether DNA methylation can mediate the changes in protein expression that influence EVT differentiation, adhesion and migration.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yuxiang Hu"", ids = ""48483522""); list(name = ""Ryan K.

76b3ec2b0986c77f0e6005861e07bfcb119ef944,"Polymorphisms of estrogen receptors and risk of biliary tract cancers and gallstones: a population-based study in Shanghai, China.","Biliary tract cancer encompasses tumors of the gallbladder, bile duct and ampulla of Vater. Gallbladder cancer is more common in women, whereas bile duct cancer is more common in men, suggesting that sex hormones may play a role in the etiology of these cancers. The intracellular action of estrogens is regulated by the estrogen receptor (ESR); thus, we examined the role of common genetic variants in ESR genes on the risk of biliary tract cancers and stones in a population-based case-control study in Shanghai, China (411 cancer cases, 895 stone cases and 786 controls). We genotyped six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), four in ESR1 (rs2234693, rs3841686, rs2228480 and rs1801132) and two in ESR2 (rs1256049 and rs4986938). In all participants, the ESR1 rs1801132 (P325P) G allele was associated with excess risks of bile duct [odds ratio (OR) = 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.8] and ampulla of Vater cancers (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 0.9-4.9) compared with the CC genotype. The association with bile duct cancer was apparent among men (OR = 2.8, 95% CI 1.4-5.7) but not among women (P-heterogeneity = 0.01). Also, the ESR2 rs4986938 (38 bp 3' of STP) GG genotype was associated with a higher risk of bile duct cancer (OR = 3.3, 95% CI 1.3-8.7) compared with the AA genotype, although this estimate was based on a small number of subjects. None of the other SNPs examined was associated with biliary tract cancers or stones. False discovery rate-adjusted P-values were not significant (P > 0.1). No association was found for ESR1 haplotype based on four SNPs. These preliminary results suggest that variants in ESR genes could play a role in the etiology of biliary tract cancers, especially bile duct cancer in men.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sue Kyung Park"", ids = ""3395636""); list(name = ""Gabriella Andreotti"", ids = ""3003370""); list(name = ""Asif Rashid"", ids = ""145043591""); list(name = ""Jinbo Chen"", ids = ""3147177""); list(name = ""Philip S Rosenberg"", ids = ""35272929""); list(name = ""Kai Yu"", ids = ""144887706""); list(name = ""Jennifer Olsen"", ids = ""50855682""); list(name = ""Yu-tang Gao"", ids = ""1817931""); list(name = ""Jie Deng"", ids = ""143705021""); list(name = ""Lori C Sakoda"", ids = ""6426015""); list(name = ""Mingdong Zhang"", ids = ""4863826""); list(name = ""Ming-chang Shen"", ids = ""6104086""); list(name = ""Bing-sheng Wang"", ids = ""5553963""); list(name = ""Tian-quan Han"", ids = ""16718353""); list(name = ""Bai-he Zhang"", ids = ""5064964""); list(name = ""Meredith Ann Yeager"", ids = ""144233652""); list(name = ""Stephen J.

a11df429b526994c7cc6651ac2d45ff2b87f52d1,D-Guaranteed Discrimination of Statistical Hypotheses: a Review of Results and Unsolved Problems,"We compare two sequential d-guaranteed tests and an optimal d-guaranteed test based on a fixed number of observations with respect to the average number of observations within the most accepted practical applications of Bayesian probabilistic models. We consider the sequential â€œfirst skippingâ€ test, the sequential locally efficient test based on the score statistic, and the test based on a fixed number of observations that minimizes the necessary sample size. We study various characteristics of these tests connected with the number of observations within three probabilistic models, namely, the normal (Ï‘, Ïƒ2) distribution of the observed random variable and the normal a priori distribution of Ï‘ with fixed Ïƒ2; the exponential distribution with the intensity parameter Ï‘ and the a priori gamma distribution of Ï‘; and the Bernoulli sampling with the success probability Ï‘ and the a priori beta distribution of Ï‘. We discuss the connection of the d-posterior approach with the compound decision problem as applied to the analysis of data provided by microchips (when the false discovery rate, or FDR, for short, is treated as the d-risk of the first kind). We present the vast data on characteristics of the mentioned tests obtained by the method of mathematical modeling in several tables. We discuss unsolved problems of the d-guaranteed discrimination of hypotheses with the minimal number of observations and approaches to their solution.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""D. S.

In clinical practice, the safety profile of GH replacement therapy for GH-deficient adults compared with no replacement therapy is unknown.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to compare adverse events (AEs) in GH-deficient adults who were GH-treated with those in GH-deficient adults who did not receive GH replacement.


DESIGN AND SETTING
This was a prospective observational study in the setting of US clinical practices.


PATIENTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES
AEs were compared between GH-treated (n = 1988) and untreated (n = 442) GH-deficient adults after adjusting for baseline group differences and controlling the false discovery rate. The standardized mortality ratio was calculated using US mortality rates.


RESULTS
After a mean follow-up of 2.3 years, there was no significant difference in rates of death, cancer, intracranial tumor growth or recurrence, diabetes, or cardiovascular events in GH-treated compared with untreated patients. The standardized mortality ratio was not increased in either group. Unexpected AEs (GH-treated vs untreated, P â‰¤ .05) included insomnia (6.4% vs 2.7%), dyspnea (4.2% vs 2.0%), anxiety (3.4% vs 0.9%), sleep apnea (3.3% vs 0.9%), and decreased libido (2.1% vs 0.2%). Some of these AEs were related to baseline risk factors (including obesity and cardiopulmonary disease), higher GH dose, or concomitant GH side effects.


CONCLUSIONS
In GH-deficient adults, there was no evidence for a GH treatment effect on death, cancer, intracranial tumor recurrence, diabetes, or cardiovascular events, although the follow-up period was of insufficient duration to be conclusive for these long-term events. The identification of unexpected GH-related AEs reinforces the fact that patient selection and GH dose titration are important to ensure safety of adult GH replacement.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mark L Hartman"", ids = ""2244842""); list(name = ""Rong Xu"", ids = ""144139906""); list(name = ""Brenda J.

e6ec4729669b035a11cb8937217c521cca5f826a,Modeling contaminants in AP-MS/MS experiments.,"Identification of protein-protein interactions (PPI) by affinity purification (AP) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (AP-MS/MS) produces large data sets with high rates of false positives. This is in part because of contamination at the AP level (due to gel contamination, nonspecific binding to the TAP columns in the context of tandem affinity purification, insufficient purification, etc.). In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian approach to identify false-positive PPIs involving contaminants in AP-MS/MS experiments. Specifically, we propose a confidence assessment algorithm (called Decontaminator) that builds a model of contaminants using a small number of representative control experiments. It then uses this model to determine whether the Mascot score of a putative prey is significantly larger than what was observed in control experiments and assigns it a p-value and a false discovery rate. We show that our method identifies contaminants better than previously used approaches and results in a set of PPIs with a larger overlap with databases of known PPIs. Our approach will thus allow improved accuracy in PPI identification while reducing the number of control experiments required.",2011,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mathieu LavallÃ©e-Adam"", ids = ""1401789791""); list(name = ""Philippe Cloutier"", ids = ""37188348""); list(name = ""Benoit Coulombe"", ids = ""144705878""); list(name = ""Mathieu Blanchette"", ids = ""3176289"")",380ce90158e8781ee350233bbcaf66aa585a1c94; 53d60a3843170699d55a3dea23d0a075596cd82d; 1530762cbf4461e428eae1d31ec04d002c4a381c; ac626eb103eba9948badf80eec0a114825495610; e630d9a5f7bd1a30e6f05b892cda5cb4d66f1ec4; 73a36bf73ba94f9ba1ade68ca2b84fab7485d6be; 0e5e65023468a1e338cb2948e69381341d4f1240; b9245bd1fdf28b90e0f5b8facb76f4bde88ff01f; 45e8ba893925faedbace0442ffad118a5a4c6062; 28cddae840169ef9fd73ca91d27d33f7b664b757; 069693daf2a50e0737bf9068bb3a437183e18fb4; a0331c36351dcab4b2bdbab5038c8bd914ce3d98; 5e0021143d2c41f533eb2946882c372f508d4970; fe50e4d26857bebde920c06cf2a616ab9fc7a1fc; 2e17ef224a4f427418eb95d0d4ea88c1694f737f; 9c6b2e48b7559dadbabcf4d531458a14f18ef1dd; aa6c9c64303dc83aaba5c314a844fdb766faaa19; 6a93ef37c6d5cd42bb8fbc9a6d4ececf1c933f9e; 65ac5e14aa786133b18971015da1b43072c85d07; 64300807a7a14a9be8d85b7aa2e17da8204ed0d6; c96d887aa43588112b2b195af61f22a56c461a0a; e4a7103f313276caf176d35b9f8821767aab52a6; 1242c88a7d879d4cfa688c069cfdf0698b36be94; 69e878d5fca9f876f422fd19dbc10398a7253be3; c4e02c976ac65cd627336a55c77c3ba2b6e091e2,,Journal of proteome research,10 2,"

ddf384ad94a50f73b1a6251678d44517ce02875f,"Association between UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 gene polymorphisms with markers of adiposity in European adolescents: The HELENA study.","AIMS
To examine the association between UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 gene polymorphisms with adiposity markers in European adolescents and to test if there were gene interactions with objectively measured physical activity and adiposity.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study that involves 1.057 European adolescents (12-18Â years old) from the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence Cross-Sectional Study. A total of 18 polymorphisms in UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 genes were genotyped. We measured weight, height, waist, and hip circumferences and triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness. Physical activity was objectively measured by accelerometry during 7Â days.


RESULTS
The C allele of the UCP1 rs6536991 polymorphism was associated with a lower risk of overweight (odds ratio [OR]: T/CÂ +Â C/C vs T/T)Â =Â 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53-0.98; PÂ =Â 0.034; false discovery rate [FDR]Â =Â 0.048). There was a significant interaction between UCP1 rs2071415 polymorphism and physical activity with waist-to-hip ratio (PÂ =Â 0.006; FDRÂ =Â 0.026). Adolescents who did not meet the physical activity recommendations (less than 60Â min/day of moderate to vigorous physical activity) and carrying the C/C genotype had higher waist-to-hip ratio (+ 0.067; 95% CI, 0.028-0.106; PÂ =Â 0.003), while no differences across genotypes were observed in adolescents meeting the recommendations.


CONCLUSIONS
Two UCP1 polymorphisms were associated with adiposity in European adolescents. Meeting the daily physical activity recommendations may overcome the effect of the UCP1 rs2071415 polymorphism on obesity-related traits.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jose Miguel Pascual-Gamarra"", ids = ""1435571570""); list(name = ""Diego F Salazar-Tortosa"", ids = ""1435513863""); list(name = ""Borja Martinez-Tellez"", ids = ""1398083605""); list(name = ""Idoia Labayen"", ids = ""5879327""); list(name = ""Azahara I RupÃ©rez"", ids = ""6459160""); list(name = ""Laura Censi"", ids = ""4972752""); list(name = ""Yannis Manios"", ids = ""6238540""); list(name = ""Esther Nova"", ids = ""2824742""); list(name = ""Eva Gesteiro"", ids = ""6123461""); list(name = ""Luis A Moreno"", ids = ""144403148""); list(name = ""Aline Meirhaeghe"", ids = ""3911251""); list(name = ""Jonatan R.

e83bdd8d25bf6868ad2bdee51428edf790500144,Global gene expression profiling of androgen disruption in Qurt strain medaka.,"Androgen disrupting chemicals (ADCs) are endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that mimic or antagonize the effect of physiological androgens. Microarray-based detection of altered gene expression can be used as a biomarker of EDC exposure. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify and compare gene expression profiles of the androgen 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), the antiandrogen flutamide (FLU), and the antiandrogenic fungicide vinclozolin (VIN), on Qurt medaka (Oryzias latipes). Biologically effective concentrations for 11-KT (100 microg/L), VIN (100 microg/L), and FLU (1000 microg/L) determined in range-finding studies were used for exposures. The oligonucleotide microarray included 9379 probes for EDC-affected genes, medaka cDNAs, sequences from the medaka genome project, and the UniGene database. We found that treatment with FLU, VIN, and 11-KT caused significant (false discovery rate = 0.01) differential expression of at least 87, 82, and 578 genes, respectively. Two sets of responsive genes are associated to vertebrate sex differentiation and growth, and 50 genes were useful in discriminating between ADC classes. The discriminating capacity was confirmed by a remarkable similarity of the antiandrogenic expression profiles of VIN and FLU, which were distinct from the androgenic profile of 11-KT. Gene expression profiles characterized in this study allow for reliable screening of ADC activity.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Abimael LeÃ³n"", ids = ""32671892""); list(name = ""Ping-Shi Wu"", ids = ""2937176""); list(name = ""Linda C.

14dbb89b8412388b0e0331fc2c696891e6a5d1e6,Filtering for increased power for microarray data analysis,"BackgroundDue to the large number of hypothesis tests performed during the process of routine analysis of microarray data, a multiple testing adjustment is certainly warranted. However, when the number of tests is very large and the proportion of differentially expressed genes is relatively low, the use of a multiple testing adjustment can result in very low power to detect those genes which are truly differentially expressed. Filtering allows for a reduction in the number of tests and a corresponding increase in power. Common filtering methods include filtering by variance, average signal or MAS detection call (for Affymetrix arrays). We study the effects of filtering in combination with the Benjamini-Hochberg method for false discovery rate control and q-value for false discovery rate estimation.ResultsThree case studies are used to compare three different filtering methods in combination with the two false discovery rate methods and three different preprocessing methods. For the case studies considered, filtering by detection call and variance (on the original scale) consistently led to an increase in the number of differentially expressed genes identified. On the other hand, filtering by variance on the log2 scale had a detrimental effect when paired with MAS5 or PLIER preprocessing methods, even when the testing was done on the log2 scale. A simulation study was done to further examine the effect of filtering by variance. We find that filtering by variance leads to higher power, often with a decrease in false discovery rate, when paired with either of the false discovery rate methods considered. This holds regardless of the proportion of genes which are differentially expressed or whether we assume dependence or independence among genes.ConclusionThe case studies show that both detection call and variance filtering are viable methods of filtering which can increase the number of differentially expressed genes identified. The simulation study demonstrates that when paired with a false discovery rate method, filtering by variance can increase power while still controlling the false discovery rate. Filtering out 50% of probe sets seems reasonable as long as the majority of genes are not expected to be differentially expressed.",2008,Medicine; Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Amber J.

70a8feb172ce59ac6c3ed3e6eb1b58099fe4fdfd,Association of matrix metalloproteinase gene polymorphisms with refractive error in Amish and Ashkenazi families.,"PURPOSE
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are involved in scleral extracellular matrix remodeling and have shown differential expression in experimental myopia. The genetic association of refractive error and polymorphisms in MMP and TIMP genes in Old Order Amish (AMISH) and Ashkenazi Jewish (ASHK) families was investigated.


METHODS
Individuals from 55 AMISH and 63 ASHK families participated in the study. Ascertainment was designed to enrich the families for myopia; the mean spherical equivalent (MSE) refractive error (SD) was -1.61 (2.72) D in the AMISH, and -3.56 (3.32) D in the ASHK. One hundred forty-six common haplotype tagging SNPs covering 14 MMP and 4 TIMP genes were genotyped in 358 AMISH and 535 ASHK participants. Association analyses of MSE and the spherical component of refraction (SPH) were performed separately for the AMISH and the ASHK. Bonferroni-corrected significance thresholds and local false discovery rates were used to account for multiple testing.


RESULTS
After they were filtered for quality-control, 127 SNPs were included in the analyses. No polymorphisms showed statistically significant association to refraction in the ASHK (minimum P = 0.0132). In AMISH, two SNPs showed evidence of association with refractive phenotypes: rs1939008 (P = 0.00016 for SPH); and rs9928731 (P = 0.00026 for SPH). These markers were each estimated to explain <5% of the variance of SPH in the AMISH sample.


CONCLUSIONS
Statistically significant genetic associations of ocular refraction to polymorphisms near MMP1 and within MMP2 were identified in the AMISH but not among the ASHK families. The results suggest that the MMP1 and MMP2 genes are involved in refractive variation in the AMISH. Genetic and/or environmental heterogeneity most likely contribute to differences in association results between ethnic groups.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Robert Wojciechowski"", ids = ""1923503""); list(name = ""Joan E.

Colonization of a secondary organ requires specific molecular alterations of the host microenvironment. To determine the temporal and spatial changes associated with metastatic dissemination to the axillary lymph nodes, gene expression profiles were compared between histologically normal lymph nodes from node-positive patients and tumor-free nodes from node-negative patients. Using a stringent false discovery rate correction (<0.05) for multiple hypothesis testing, we did not detect any differentially expressed genes between the lymph node groups. Thus, the presence of metastatic cells within the lymphatic system does not elicit widespread changes in gene expression through the axillary basin; rather, lymph nodes independently respond to disseminated tumor cells.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Heather L.

1ab947b23f326a198c392ce02f432d41dcdb8eb3,Exploring LAG-3 Expression in Multiple Myeloma Patients Following Autologous Stem Cell Transplant,"Background: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is associated with T-cell dysfunction. MM-related T-cell deficiencies are reported as both quantitative and qualitative defects with variable functional abnormalities. The clinical significance of these T-cell abnormalities in MM is not fully characterized. Furthermore, the impact of Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) on T-cell subsets and immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, PD-1, BLIMP-1, CTLA-4/CD28, TIM-3, and LAG-3, is being explored. Here we examined these features along with other mRNA markers of cellular senescence, immunosenescence, and exhaustion in MM patients pre- and post-ASCT. These studies aimed to improve understanding of the immunologic changes in MM and relationship to disease progression. Evaluating T-cell immune reconstitution post-transplant is invaluable for future therapies to identify targets or stimulate T-cell response to mitigate relapse. Methods: 100 MM patients were prospectively enrolled in a longitudinal study prior to ASCT for analysis of clinical and biologic factors related to clinical outcomes and event free survival (EFS) post-transplant. Paired peripheral blood T-cells (PBTL) were analyzed (n=31) before ASCT and 90 days post-ASCT. PBTL mRNA targets were anayzed using a custom Nanostring platform (OSU_Senescence) evaluating markers of cellular senescence, immunosenescence, and exhaustion. T-cell populations and subsets were further characterized by flow cytometry pre- and post-ASCT in 20 representative trial patients and 10 age- and sex-matched controls. Serum samples were analyzed for soluble ligands using Luminix MAGPIX multiplex analysis. Results: Increased PBTL LAG-3 mRNA expression at 90 days post-ASCT was significantly associated with EFS, HR 5.44 (95%CI 1.92-15.46, p=0.001, adjusted p* controlling for false discovery rate=0.038). When adjusted for age, a similar relationship of increased PBTL LAG-3 mRNA expression and EFS was found, HR 5.66 (95%CI 1.83-17.47, p=0.003, p*=0.056). No relationship was observed between other mRNA markers of immunosenesence or exhaustion and EFS. Flow cytometric analysis of post-transplant PBTLs revealed an inverted CD4:CD8 ratio, reduced CD28 expression on CD8+ T-cells, and increased levels of CD4+ T-regulatory cells. LAG-3 expression was significantly increased in CD4+ T-cells post-ASCT, predominately in the CD4 naive and central memory subsets. Soluble LAG-3 (sLAG3) serum concentrations were similar pre- and post-ASCT, and in comparison to controls. Conclusions: We found increased expression of Lymphocyte-Activation Gene, LAG-3 (CD223), on CD4+T-cells post-ASCT. PBTL LAG-3 mRNA expression 90 days post-ASCT was associated with EFS and may serve as an early indicator of adverse outcomes. LAG-3 is expressed on activated T-cells and modulates T-cell expansion and function. Future studies targeting the LAG-3 pathway are warranted to restore T-cell dysfunction and augment immunity in MM.

3681a06397cd934937db1149669dd0ca1c3a66df,Transcriptomic signatures in cartilage ageing,"IntroductionAge is an important factor in the development of osteoarthritis. Microarray studies provide insight into cartilage aging but do not reveal the full transcriptomic phenotype of chondrocytes such as small noncoding RNAs, pseudogenes, and microRNAs. RNA-Seq is a powerful technique for the interrogation of large numbers of transcripts including nonprotein coding RNAs. The aim of the study was to characterise molecular mechanisms associated with age-related changes in gene signatures.MethodsRNA for gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq and real-time PCR analysis was isolated from macroscopically normal cartilage of the metacarpophalangeal joints of eight horses; four young donors (4 years old) and four old donors (>15 years old). RNA sequence libraries were prepared following ribosomal RNA depletion and sequencing was undertaken using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Differentially expressed genes were defined using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction with a generalised linear model likelihood ratio test (P < 0.05, expression ratios Â± 1.4 log2 fold-change). Ingenuity pathway analysis enabled networks, functional analyses and canonical pathways from differentially expressed genes to be determined.ResultsIn total, the expression of 396 transcribed elements including mRNAs, small noncoding RNAs, pseudogenes, and a single microRNA was significantly different in old compared with young cartilage (Â± 1.4 log2 fold-change, P < 0.05). Of these, 93 were at higher levels in the older cartilage and 303 were at lower levels in the older cartilage. There was an over-representation of genes with reduced expression relating to extracellular matrix, degradative proteases, matrix synthetic enzymes, cytokines and growth factors in cartilage derived from older donors compared with young donors. In addition, there was a reduction in Wnt signalling in ageing cartilage.ConclusionThere was an age-related dysregulation of matrix, anabolic and catabolic cartilage factors.

To bridge this gap, we adopted a multi-method and multi-informant approach, including both child- and parent-report measures, as well as in vivo behavioral tasks, to evaluate how parent-level factors contribute to children's OC features. Twenty-seven parents and 48 children, who reported OC features across a spectrum of severity, completed diagnostic interviews, self-report questionnaires, and attended an experimental session in our laboratory. We first conducted univariate linear regressions to identify the significant parent-level predictors and applied the False Discovery Rate to control for Type 1 error. Next, significant predictors were entered into a multivariate mixed-effects linear regression model that included a random intercept for family unit. Results suggested that the transmission of beliefs, interpretations, and symptoms is not domain-specific; rather, certain parent factors - religiosity, depression, anxiety, stress, and psychological control - seem to operate as general vulnerability factors for children's OC features. Although the cross-sectional design precludes conclusions regarding causation, findings can inform individualized prevention programs that alter the trajectory of at-risk youth.",2018,Psychology,"list(name = ""Noah Chase Berman"", ids = ""4440342""); list(name = ""Ryan J.

c004584dd4b6f60049f03223ac83a824b814cdee,Extreme obesity is associated with variation in genes related to the circadian rhythm of food intake and hypothalamic signaling.,"The hypothalamus is important for regulation of energy intake. Mutations in genes involved in the function of the hypothalamus can lead to early-onset severe obesity. To look further into this, we have followed a strategy that allowed us to identify rare and common gene variants as candidates for the background of extreme obesity from a relatively small cohort. For that we focused on subjects with a well-selected phenotype and on a defined gene set and used a rich source of genetic data with stringent cut-off values. A list of 166 genes functionally related to the hypothalamus was generated. In those genes complete exome sequence data from 30 extreme obese subjects (60 genomes) were screened for novel rare indel, nonsense, and missense variants with a predicted negative impact on protein function. In addition, (moderately) common variants in those genes were analyzed for allelic association using the general population as reference (false discovery rate<0.05). Six novel rare deleterious missense variants were found in the genes for BAIAP3, NBEA, PRRC2A, RYR1, SIM1, and TRH, and a novel indel variant in LEPR. Common variants in the six genes for MBOAT4, NPC1, NPW, NUCB2, PER1, and PRRC2A showed significant allelic association with extreme obesity. Our findings underscore the complexity of the genetic background of extreme obesity involving rare and common variants of genes from defined metabolic and physiologic processes, in particular regulation of the circadian rhythm of food intake and hypothalamic signaling.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Edwin C M Mariman"", ids = ""30020277""); list(name = ""Freek G.

Breast cancers at different stages have tremendous differences on both phenotypic and molecular patterns. The developmental stage is an essential factor in the clinical decision of treatment plans, but was usually formulated as a classification problem, which ignored the consecutive relationships among them.


MATERIALS & METHODS
This study proposed a regression-based procedure to detect the stage biomarkers of breast cancers. Biomarkers were detected by the Lasso and Ridge algorithms.


RESULTS & CONCLUSION
A collaboration duet of Lasso and Ridge regression algorithms achieved the best performances, with classification accuracy (Acc) equal to 0.8294 and regression goodness-of-fit (R2) equal toÂ 0.7810. The 265 biomarker genes were enriched with the signal peptide-based secretion function with the Bonferroni-corrected p-value equal to 6.9408e-3 and false discovery rate (FDR) equal to 1.1614e-2.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xin Feng"", ids = ""145976729""); list(name = ""Ruochi Zhang"", ids = ""144906126""); list(name = ""Minge Liu"", ids = ""46332028""); list(name = ""Quewang Liu"", ids = ""83875550""); list(name = ""Fei Li"", ids = ""49515693""); list(name = ""Zhenwei Yan"", ids = ""47845595""); list(name = ""Fengfeng Zhou"", ids = ""40242610"")",a360b70f4231a16af7a6cb4c3060e767d25c21a6; cb877226c8e4c9f56fd7ac8b2106e7054ef3d1b2; 48bc21590bf958c0c538ff8d6553a908321aa88c,,Biomarkers in medicine,13 1,"

8cbebd83cf8c945f182c9a0d6a0d4c18ceb8079b,SIPA1L3 methylation modifies the benefit of smoking cessation on lung adenocarcinoma survival: an epigenomicâ€“smoking interaction analysis,"Smoking cessation prolongs survival and decreases mortality of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, epigenetic alterations of some genes are associated with survival. However, potential interactions between smoking cessation and epigenetics have not been assessed. Here, we conducted an epigenome-wide interaction analysis between DNA methylation and smoking cessation on NSCLC survival. We used a two-stage study design to identify DNA methylation-smoking cessation interactions that affect overall survival for early-stage NSCLC. The discovery phase contained NSCLC patients from Harvard, Spain, Norway, and Sweden. A histology-stratified Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, clinical stage, and study center was used to test DNA methylation-smoking cessation interaction terms. Interactions with false discovery rate-qÂ â‰¤Â 0.05 were further confirmed in a validation phase using The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Histology-specific interactions were identified by stratification analysis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients. We identified one CpG probe (cg02268510SIPA 1L3 ) that significantly and exclusively modified the effect of smoking cessation on survival in LUAD patients [hazard ratioÂ (HR)interaction Â =Â 1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-1.16; PÂ =Â 4.30Â Ã—Â 10-7 ]. Further, the effect of smoking cessation on early-stage LUAD survival varied across patients with different methylation levels of cg02268510SIPA 1L3 . Smoking cessation only benefited LUAD patients with low methylation (HRÂ =Â 0.53; 95% CI: 0.34-0.82; PÂ =Â 4.61Â Ã—Â 10-3 ) rather than medium or high methylation (HRÂ =Â 1.21; 95% CI: 0.86-1.70; PÂ =Â 0.266) of cg02268510SIPA 1L3 . Moreover, there was an antagonistic interaction between elevated methylation of cg02268510SIPA 1L3 and smoking cessation (HRinteraction Â =Â 2.1835; 95% CI: 1.27-3.74; PÂ =Â 4.46Â Ã—Â 10-3 ). In summary, smoking cessation benefited survival of LUAD patients with low methylation at cg02268510SIPA 1L3 . The results have implications for not only smoking cessation after diagnosis, but also possible methylation-specific drug targeting.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ruyang Zhang"", ids = ""7265522""); list(name = ""Linjing Lai"", ids = ""3436913""); list(name = ""Xuesi Dong"", ids = ""51262712""); list(name = ""Jieyu He"", ids = ""8516530""); list(name = ""Dongfang You"", ids = ""67135824""); list(name = ""Chao Yi Chen"", ids = ""153246452""); list(name = ""Lijuan Lin"", ids = ""6145932""); list(name = ""Ying Zhu"", ids = ""4417209""); list(name = ""Hui Huang"", ids = ""49696827""); list(name = ""Sipeng Shen"", ids = ""10997919""); list(name = ""Liangmin Wei"", ids = ""7031934""); list(name = ""Xin Chen"", ids = ""48282690""); list(name = ""Yichen Guo"", ids = ""6062007""); list(name = ""Liya Liu"", ids = ""46458468""); list(name = ""Li Su"", ids = ""73701439""); list(name = ""Andrea Shafer"", ids = ""24430936""); list(name = ""SebastiÃ¡n Moran"", ids = ""1860121""); list(name = ""Thomas Fleischer"", ids = ""5287253""); list(name = ""Maria Moksnes Bjaanaes"", ids = ""41037155""); list(name = ""Anna E.

d457c8f2fdf948f0ab583b756df46f7978ba10df,"RNA-sequencing analysis reveals the hepatotoxic mechanism of perfluoroalkyl alternatives, HFPO2 and HFPO4, following exposure in mice.","The toxicological impact of traditional perfluoroalkyl chemicals has led to the elimination and restriction of these substances. However, many novel perfluoroalkyl alternatives remain unregulated and little is known about their potential effects on environmental and human health. Daily administration of two alternative perfluoroalkyl substances, HFPO2 and HFPO4 (1â€‰mgâ€‰kg-1 body weight), for 28â€‰days resulted in hepatomegaly and hepatic histopathological injury in mice, particularly in the HFPO4 group. We generated and compared high-throughput RNA-sequencing data from hepatic tissues in control and treatment group mice to clarify the mechanism of HFPO2 and HFPO4 hepatotoxicity. We identified 146 (101 upregulated, 45 downregulated) and 1295 (716 upregulated, 579 downregulated) hepatic transcripts that exhibited statistically significant changes (fold change â‰¥2 or â‰¤0.5, false discovery rateÂ <Â 0.05) after HFPO2 and HFPO4 treatment, respectively. Among them, 111 (82 upregulated, 29 downregulated) transcripts were changed in both groups, and lipid metabolism associated genes were dominant. Thus, similar to their popular predecessors, HFPO2 and HFPO4 exposure exerted hepatic effects, including hepatomegaly and injury, and altered lipid metabolism gene levels in the liver, though HFPO4 exerted greater hepatotoxicity than HFPO2. The unregulated use of these emerging perfluoroalkyl alternatives may affect environmental and human health, and their biological effects need further exploration.

b756bc0a3b52bd899aa846c41a45cdb190b919ea,Gray matter atrophy in patients with mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease over the course of developing delusions.,"OBJECTIVE
We conducted a neuroimaging analysis to understand the neuroanatomical correlates of gray matter loss in a group of mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease patients who developed delusions.


METHODS
With data collected as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we conducted voxel-based morphometry to determine areas of gray matter change in the same Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants, before and after they developed delusions.


RESULTS
We identified 14 voxel clusters with significant gray matter decrease in patient scans post-delusional onset, correcting for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate, pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Major areas of difference included the right and left insulae, left precuneus, the right and left cerebellar culmen, the left superior temporal gyrus, the right posterior cingulate, the right thalamus, and the left parahippocampal gyrus.


CONCLUSIONS
Although contrary to our initial predictions of enhanced right frontal atrophy, our preliminary work identifies several neuroanatomical areas, including the cerebellum and left posterior hemisphere, which may be involved in delusional development in these patients.",2016,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Corinne E.

We previously reported a genome-wide significant linkage for major psychosis in chromosome 13q13-q14.


METHODS
An association analysis was conducted in 247 unrelated DSM-IV schizophrenia (SZ) patients and 250 unrelated control subjects from the Eastern Quebec population genotyped with 2150 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 13q13-q14. We also used the kindred sample where linkage was detected (125 SZ, 120 bipolar disorder [BD] and 36 schizoaffective disorder patients vs. 467 unaffected adult relatives) for replication.


RESULTS
An association of the T allele of rs1156026 found in the case-control sample (odds ratio [OR] = 1.81, p = 4 Ã— 10(-6), false discovery rate = .01) was replicated in the kindred sample (OR = 1.54, p = .01), strengthening the overall association evidence (p = 8 Ã— 10(-7)). The effect size increased in the subset of unrelated patients with a family history (OR = 2.28) and in the 15 families where SZ was predominant (OR = 2.03). In the kindred sample, onset of either SZ or BD was, on average, 5 years earlier for T/T compared with C/C homozygotes, leading to stronger association in patients with onset before 26 years of age (SZ: OR = 2.40, p = 1.3 Ã— 10(-4); SZ, BD, and schizoaffective disorder combined: OR = 1.87, p = 8 Ã— 10(-5)).


CONCLUSIONS
Case-control and family-based association provided evidence of a locus at 13q13-q14 related to SZ.

01ad565d517fbe90852996cb7cb45ff9616a8ca5,Common sequence polymorphisms shaping genetic diversity in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"The genomes of individuals from the same species vary in sequence as a result of different evolutionary processes. To examine the patterns of, and the forces shaping, sequence variation in Arabidopsis thaliana, we performed high-density array resequencing of 20 diverse strains (accessions). More than 1 million nonredundant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified at moderate false discovery rates (FDRs), and approximately 4% of the genome was identified as being highly dissimilar or deleted relative to the reference genome sequence. Patterns of polymorphism are highly nonrandom among gene families, with genes mediating interaction with the biotic environment having exceptional polymorphism levels. At the chromosomal scale, regional variation in polymorphism was readily apparent. A scan for recent selective sweeps revealed several candidate regions, including a notable example in which almost all variation was removed in a 500-kilobase window. Analyzing the polymorphisms we describe in larger sets of accessions will enable a detailed understanding of forces shaping population-wide sequence variation in A. thaliana.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Richard M.

c6b59ccb192042eec4622a2010a0903f65a92449,Gene expression imputation identifies candidate genes and susceptibility loci associated with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a common skin cancer with genetic susceptibility loci identified in recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) using imputed gene expression levels can identify additional gene-levelÂ associations. Here we impute gene expression levels in 6891Â cSCC cases and 54,566Â controls in the Kaiser Permanente Genetic Epidemiology Research in Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort and 25,558Â self-reported cSCC cases and 673,788Â controls from 23andMe. In a discovery-validation study, we identify 19 loci containing 33 genes whose imputed expression levels are associated with cSCC at false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰10% in the GERA cohort and validate 15 of these candidate genes at Bonferroni significance in the 23andMe dataset, including eight genes in five novel susceptibility loci and seven genes in four previously associated loci. These results suggest genetic mechanisms contributing to cSCC risk and illustrate advantages and disadvantages of TWAS as a supplement to traditional GWAS analyses.Genetic loci linked to susceptibility for the common skin cancer cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) have been identified by genome wide association studies (GWAS).

0dd6e79ccd19b62f6ce5ddc63dec1281008c385d,Comprehensive proteomics of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 metabolism under single carbon and nonmethylotrophic conditions.,"In order to validate a gel free quantitative proteomics assay for the model methylotrophic bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, we examined the M. extorquens AM1 proteome under single carbon (methanol) and multicarbon (succinate) growth, conditions that have been studied for decades and for which extensive corroborative data have been compiled. In total, 4447 proteins from a database containing 7556 putative ORFs from M. extorquens AM1 could be identified with two or more peptide sequences, corresponding to a qualitative proteome coverage of 58%. Statistically significant nonzero (log(2) scale) differential abundance ratios of methanol/succinate could be detected for 317 proteins using summed ion intensity measurements and 585 proteins using spectral counting, at a q-value cut-off of 0.01, a measure of false discovery rate. The results were compared to recent microarray studies performed under equivalent chemostat conditions. The M. extorquens AM1 studies demonstrated the feasibility of scaling up the multidimensional capillary HPLC MS/MS approach to a prokaryotic organism with a proteome more than three times the size of microbes we have investigated previously, while maintaining a high degree of proteome coverage and reliable quantitative abundance ratios.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Gundula Bosch"", ids = ""50049075""); list(name = ""Elizabeth Skovran"", ids = ""5858902""); list(name = ""Qiangwei Xia"", ids = ""35673589""); list(name = ""Tiansong Wang"", ids = ""1898552""); list(name = ""Fred Taub"", ids = ""79899515""); list(name = ""Jonathan A.

854d7a2532fb59bebba38833f95825da42bfd17f,A non-parametric maximum for number of selected features: objective optima for FDR and significance threshold with application to ordinal survey analysis,"This paper identifies a criterion for choosing an optimum set of selected features, or rejected null hypotheses, in high-dimensional data analysis. The method is designed for dimension reduction with multiple hypothesis testing used in filtering process of big data, and in exploratory research, to identify significant associations among many predictor variables and few outcomes. The novelty of the proposed method is that the selected p-value threshold will be insensitive to dependency within features, and between features and outcome. The method neither requires predetermined thresholds for level of significance, nor uses presumed thresholds for false discovery rate. Using the presented method, the optimum p-value for powerful yet parsimonious model is chosen, then for every set of rejected hypotheses, the researcher can also report traditional measures of statistical accuracy such as the expected number of false positives, and false discovery rate. The upper limit for number of rejected hypotheses (or selected features) is determined by finding the maximum difference between expected true hypotheses and expected false hypotheses among all possible sets of rejected hypotheses. Then, many methods of choosing an optimum number of selected features such as piecewise regression are used to form a parsimonious model.

421255bace6602efe65fe59945a0c1b4ec93860b,iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics reveals the neuroprotection of rhubarb in experimental intracerebral hemorrhage.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE
Rhubarb is a traditional Chinese medicine(TCM), that possesses neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidative, purgative and anticancer properties, and has been used to treat intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and many other diseases.


AIMS OF THE STUDY
This study aimed to investigate the changes of brain protein in ICH rats treated with rhubarb and to explore the multi-target mechanism of rhubarb in the treatment of ICH via bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Rats were subjected to collagenase-induced ICH and then treated orally with 3 or 12â€¯g/kg rhubarb daily for 2 days following ICH. After sacrifice, total protein of brain tissue was extracted, and isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was employed to quantitatively identify of the DEPs in two treatment groups compared with the vehicle group. The DEPs were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and STRING databases. Bioinformatics Analysis Tool for Molecular mechanism of TCM (BATMAN-TCM) was used to predict the target of rhubarb and western blotting was used for verification.


RESULTS
In total, 1356 proteins were identified with a 1% false discovery rate (FDR). Among them, 55 DEPs were significantly altered in the sham, vehicle, low dose rhubarb group (LDR, 3â€¯g/kg), and high dose rhubarb group (HDR, 12â€¯g/kg). Enrichment analysis of GO annotations indicated that rhubarb mainly regulated expression of some neuron projection proteins involved in the response to drug and nervous system development. The dopaminergic synapse pathway was found to be the most significant DEP in the combined analysis of the KEGG and BATMAN-TCM databases. Based on the results of the STRING analysis, oxidative stress (OS), calcium binding protein regulation, vascularization, and energy metabolism were important in the rhubarb therapeutic process.


CONCLUSION
Rhubarb achieves its effects mainly through the dopaminergic synapse pathway in ICH treatment. The ICH-treating mechanisms of rhubarb may also involve anti-OS, calcium binding protein regulation, angiogenic regulation, and energy metabolism improvement. This study adds new evidence to clinical applications of rhubarb for ICH.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tao Liu"", ids = ""46999273""); list(name = ""Jing Zhou"", ids = ""46618529""); list(name = ""Hanjin Cui"", ids = ""14726856""); list(name = ""Pengfei Li"", ids = ""47470919""); list(name = ""Jiekun Luo"", ids = ""4608312""); list(name = ""Teng Li"", ids = ""1791207""); list(name = ""Feng He"", ids = ""97657028""); list(name = ""Yang Wang"", ids = list()); list(name = ""Tao Tang"", ids = ""145608315"")",,,Journal of ethnopharmacology,232,"

f929f5f354a4597cd4f888684f45ed60bb9efc2d,GWASinlps: nonâ€local prior based iterative SNP selection tool for genomeâ€wide association studies,"Motivation: Multiple marker analysis of the genomeâ€wide association study (GWAS) data has gained ample attention in recent years. However, because of the ultra highâ€dimensionality of GWAS data, such analysis is challenging. Frequently used penalized regression methods often lead to large number of false positives, whereas Bayesian methods are computationally very expensive. Motivated to ameliorate these issues simultaneously, we consider the novel approach of using nonâ€local priors in an iterative variable selection framework. Results: We develop a variable selection method, named, iterative nonâ€local prior based selection for GWAS, or GWASinlps, that combines, in an iterative variable selection framework, the computational efficiency of the screenâ€andâ€select approach based on some association learning and the parsimonious uncertainty quantification provided by the use of nonâ€local priors. The hallmark of our method is the introduction of â€˜structured screenâ€andâ€selectâ€™ strategy, that considers hierarchical screening, which is not only based on responseâ€predictor associations, but also based on responseâ€response associations and concatenates variable selection within that hierarchy. Extensive simulation studies with single nucleotide polymorphisms having realistic linkage disequilibrium structures demonstrate the advantages of our computationally efficient method compared to several frequentist and Bayesian variable selection methods, in terms of true positive rate, false discovery rate, mean squared error and effect size estimation error. Further, we provide empirical power analysis useful for study design. Finally, a real GWAS data application was considered with human height as phenotype.

5ee5a16c74d447ad1bdcdb602a2b0cfd06630938,Integrated Expression Profiling and ChIP-seq Analyses of the Growth Inhibition Response Program of the Androgen Receptor,"BACKGROUND
The androgen receptor (AR) plays important roles in the development of male phenotype and in different human diseases including prostate cancers. The AR can act either as a promoter or a tumor suppressor depending on cell types. The AR proliferative response program has been well studied, but its prohibitive response program has not yet been thoroughly studied.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Previous studies found that PC3 cells expressing the wild-type AR inhibit growth and suppress invasion. We applied expression profiling to identify the response program of PC3 cells expressing the AR (PC3-AR) under different growth conditions (i.e. with or without androgens and at different concentration of androgens) and then applied the newly developed ChIP-seq technology to identify the AR binding regions in the PC3 cancer genome. A surprising finding was that the comparison of MOCK-transfected PC3 cells with AR-transfected cells identified 3,452 differentially expressed genes (two fold cutoff) even without the addition of androgens (i.e. in ethanol control), suggesting that a ligand independent activation or extremely low-level androgen activation of the AR. ChIP-Seq analysis revealed 6,629 AR binding regions in the cancer genome of PC3 cells with an FDR (false discovery rate) cut off of 0.05. About 22.4% (638 of 2,849) can be mapped to within 2 kb of the transcription start site (TSS). Three novel AR binding motifs were identified in the AR binding regions of PC3-AR cells, and two of them share a core consensus sequence CGAGCTCTTC, which together mapped to 27.3% of AR binding regions (1,808/6,629). In contrast, only about 2.9% (190/6,629) of AR binding sites contains the canonical AR matrix M00481, M00447 and M00962 (from the Transfac database), which is derived mostly from AR proliferative responsive genes in androgen dependent cells. In addition, we identified four top ranking co-occupancy transcription factors in the AR binding regions, which include TEF1 (Transcriptional enhancer factor), GATA (GATA transcription factors), OCT (octamer transcription factors) and PU1 (PU.1 transcription factor).


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
Our data provide a valuable data set in understanding the molecular basis for growth inhibition response program of the AR in prostate cancer cells, which can be exploited for developing novel prostate cancer therapeutic strategies.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Biaoyang Lin"", ids = ""38800070""); list(name = ""Jun Wang"", ids = ""46584891""); list(name = ""Xu Hong"", ids = ""52156508""); list(name = ""Xiaowei S.

d7682dfb3189c165db687907464e16101613d0b2,SLOPE: a quick and accurate method for locating non-SNP structural variation from targeted next-generation sequence data,"MOTIVATION
Targeted 'deep' sequencing of specific genes or regions is of great interest in clinical cancer diagnostics where some sequence variants, particularly translocations and indels, have known prognostic or diagnostic significance. In this setting, it is unnecessary to sequence an entire genome, and target capture methods can be applied to limit sequencing to important regions, thereby reducing costs and the time required to complete testing. Existing 'next-gen' sequencing analysis packages are optimized for efficiency in whole-genome studies and are unable to benefit from the particular structure of targeted sequence data.


RESULTS
We developed SLOPE to detect structural variants from targeted short-DNA reads. We use both real and simulated data to demonstrate SLOPE's ability to rapidly detect insertion/deletion events of various sizes as well as translocations and viral integration sites with high sensitivity and low false discovery rate.

5e3b76e44fc59308d50c50e475f2f4966a8a94f7,Why Hasn't Genomic Testing Changed the Landscape in Clinical Oncology?,"The ""omics"" revolution produced great optimism that tumor biomarker tests based on high-order analysis of multiple (sometimes thousands) of factors would result in truly personalized oncologic care. Unfortunately, 10 years into the revolution, the promise of omics-based research has not yet been realized. The factors behind the slow progress in omics-based clinical care are many. First, over the last 15 years, there has been a gradual recognition of the importance of conducting tumor biomarker science with the kind of rigor that has traditionally been used for therapeutic research. However, this recognition has only recently been applied widely, and therefore most tumor biomarkers have insufficiently high levels of evidence to determine clinical utility. Second, omics-based research offers its own particular set of concerns, especially in regard to overfitting computational models and false discovery rates. Researchers and clinicians need to understand the importance of analytic validity, and the difference between clinical/biologic validity and clinical utility. The latter is required to introduce a tumor biomarker test of any kind (single analyte or omics-based), and are ideally generated by carefully planned and properly conducted ""prospective retrospective"" or truly prospective clinical trials. Only carefully planned studies, which take all three of these into account and in which the investigators are aware and recognize the enormous risk of unintended bias and overfitting inherent in omics-based test development, will ultimately result in translation of the exciting new technologies into better care for patients with cancer.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel F Hayes"", ids = ""2364848""); list(name = ""Muin J.

e7dee4691e9bf2b27ee2a29a675f03f113c9838c,Restingâ€State Functional Connectivity and Cognition After Major Cardiac Surgery in Older Adults without Preoperative Cognitive Impairment: Preliminary Findings,"OBJECTIVES
To look for changes in intrinsic functional brain connectivity associated with postoperative changes in cognition, a common complication in seniors undergoing major surgery, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.


DESIGN
Objective cognitive testing and functional brain imaging were prospectively performed at preoperative baseline and 6 weeks after surgery and at the same time intervals in nonsurgical controls.


SETTING
Academic medical center.


PARTICIPANTS
Older adults undergoing cardiac surgery (n = 12) and nonsurgical older adult controls with a history of coronary artery disease (n = 12); no participants had cognitive impairment at preoperative baseline (Mini-Mental State Examination score >27).


MEASUREMENTS
Differences in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and global cognitive change relationships were assessed using a voxel-wise intrinsic connectivity method, controlling for demographic factors and pre- and perioperative cerebral white matter disease volume. Analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate P < .01).


RESULTS
Global cognitive change after cardiac surgery was significantly associated with intrinsic RSFC changes in regions of the posterior cingulate cortex and right superior frontal gyrus-anatomical and functional locations of the brain's default mode network (DMN). No statistically significant relationships were found between global cognitive change and RSFC change in nonsurgical controls.


CONCLUSION
Clinicians have long known that some older adults develop postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after anesthesia and surgery, yet the neurobiological correlates of POCD are not well defined. The current results suggest that altered RSFC in specific DMN regions is positively correlated with global cognitive change 6 weeks after cardiac surgery, suggesting that DMN activity and connectivity could be important diagnostic markers of POCD or intervention targets for potential POCD treatment efforts.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jeffrey N.

18afb9a9e1422db98b8e132808b61befc5d13625,Micro-RNAs associated with the evolution of ovarian cancer cisplatin resistance.,"OBJECTIVES
Ovarian cancer (OVCA) is the leading cause of mortality among women with gynecologic malignancy, in part due to the development of chemoresistance. We sought to identify micro-RNAs (miRNAs) associated with in vitro development of OVCA chemoresistance that may also represent potential targets for therapy.


METHODS
In this study, four OVCA cell lines (A2780CP, A2780S, IGROV1, and OVCAR5) were serially treated with cisplatin in parallel with measurements of miRNA expression changes.


RESULTS
Nine miRNAs were found to be associated with increasing cisplatin resistance (IC50) (p<0.01); however, only 5 of these miRNAs have publically available information. Pathway analysis identified 15 molecular signaling pathways that were represented by genes predicted to be targets of the 5 miRNAs (false discovery rate<0.05), 11 of which are associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Further analysis identified 2 of those pathways as being associated with overall survival in 218 patients with OVCA.


CONCLUSIONS
Collectively, this panel of miRNAs associated with in vitro evolution of OVCA cisplatin resistance and the pathways identified to be associated with EMT and overall patient survival provide a framework for further investigations into EMT as a therapeutic target in patients with OVCA.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bernadette M Boac"", ids = ""5507834""); list(name = ""Yin Yi Xiong"", ids = ""144968799""); list(name = ""Douglas C.

348945f4a9d1c8f7c97ade2a572abe14f69266b7,"Identification of significant genetic variants via SLOPE, and its extension to group SLOPE","The method of Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation, abbreviated as SLOPE, is a novel sparse regression method for model selection introduced in a sequence of recent papers, [4], [3] and [7] by Bogdan, van den Berg, Sabatti, Su and Candes. It estimates the coefficients of a linear model that possibly has more unknown parameters than observations. In many settings the SLOPE method is shown to successfully control the false discovery rate (the proportion of the irrelevant among all selected predictors) at a user specified level. In this paper we evaluate its performance on genetic data, and show its superiority over LASSO which is a related and popular method. Often in genetic data sets, group structures among the predictor variables are given as prior knowledge, such as SNPs in a gene or genes in a pathway. Following this motivation we extend SLOPE in the spirit of Group LASSO to Group SLOPE, a method that can handle group structures between the predictor variables, which are ubiquitous in real genetic data. Our simulation results show that the proposed Group SLOPE method is capable of controlling the false discovery rate at a specified level. Moreover, our simulations show that compared to Group LASSO, Group SLOPE in general achieves a higher power as well as a lower false discovery rate.",2015,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Alexej Gossmann"", ids = ""3283777""); list(name = ""Shaolong Cao"", ids = ""3020658""); list(name = ""Yu-ping Wang"", ids = ""2679901"")",2aff3e8dcf12ef85a98bb6aad3ee5a6b1f3646ea; c8863e181b1aba02e2ae7a28d92c37767a96ee1f; 0e40441cebb03fa4df6fad43ef5ff592e34c479b; 6a45974b4bea4da2ee39780c20f860e68d012917,4969afda99c889786496b31a98510e0ccfdd7960; b8d527eea7a492d8673d1b551208f0b0b6198182; bee570503aaa0ed5bc5dd4cf6aa742df0b5cef87; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; 15a196e8b08b9e0d977a65ff13320343657846e3; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c8430c5d13834e46631960469d86f7ed4577b0e2; 9c048cb32d987e3cbaca577db2090882422ca0be; 003e586edfa3101af83abb21c694f89aef007b7a; 7cd1619370c1ab9b68acbb05d91b6562c78ed8a8; eaf299fa4016a70a24a685dbc757b8320dd30e73; 1b60c4fddb8ab5475bc3295a2d0af4b1167bc444; 8e9f5c99f8c006e78eb9e515ec9c618cc34f2794; 4f7fe2690dbac3b41132685ef8c7be287aa22c82; 3c718363c22221fd16771672da3bfd5f67d2c34c; 3daa1216f7e6f7118ecc52c5f453d05891214bab; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5,,,232-240

We focus here on microarray data generated from cancer studies. It is potentially important for the discovery of biomarkers to identify genes whose expression levels correlate with tumor progression. In this article, we propose a simple procedure for the identification of such genes, which we term tumor progression genes. The first stage involves estimation based on the proportional odds model. At the second stage, we calculate two quantities: a q-value, and a shrinkage estimator of the test statistic is constructed to adjust for the multiple testing problem. The relationship between the proposed method with the false discovery rate is studied. The proposed methods are applied to data from a prostate cancer microarray study.",2007,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Debashis Ghosh"", ids = ""145165051""); list(name = ""Arul M.

94ddc38729bcc6af9eb2d4075ba90ee2cb04e162,Strategies for quantitative RNA-seq analyses among closely related species,"With the growing appreciation for the role of regulatory differences in evolution, researchers need to reliably quantify expression levels within and among species. However, for non-model organisms genome assemblies and annotations are often not available or have inferior quality, biasing the inference of expression changes to an unknown extent. Here, we explore the possibility to map RNA-seq reads from diverged species to one high quality reference genome. As test case, we used a small primate phylogeny ranging from Human to Marmoset spanning 12% nucleotide divergence. To distinguish the effect of sequence divergence and genome quality, we used in silico evolved genomes and existing genomes to simulate RNA-seq reads. These were then mapped to the genome of origin (self-mapping) as well as to one common reference (cross-mapping) to infer the quantification biases. We find that the bias due to cross-mapping is small for the closely related great apes (â‰¤ 4% divergence), and preferable to self-mapping given current genome qualities. For closely related species, cross-mapping provides easy access, high power and a well controlled false discovery rate for both; the analysis of intra-species expression differences as well as the detection of relative differences between species. If divergence increases, so that a substantial fraction of reads exceeds the limits of the mapper used, we find that gene-specific corrections and effect-size cutoffs can limit the bias before self-mapping becomes unavoidable. In summary, for the first time we systematically quantify biases in cross-species RNA-seq studies, providing guidance to best practices for these important evolutionary studies.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Swati Parekh"", ids = ""35561248""); list(name = ""Beate Vieth"", ids = ""33914469""); list(name = ""Christoph Ziegenhain"", ids = ""6505284""); list(name = ""Wolfgang Enard"", ids = ""2089138""); list(name = ""Ines Hellmann"", ids = ""49465840"")",f4e37199f17ed616f27830dad75ecc7ac4d2ea17; eb0785d9bbee233be054b78a39a86a96ac03ec8b,b2cc3963adcecfb8d6877931140e3d2fda83f880; 202eb885ca241c5070cb3248ad922148d2a5de45; cdbe8a265ef4bd8350722d2209fc6cc6290da1b3; 7623cb1450f7c578bd3d5d6061cbeedd845d9bdb; 3e670bc0860d52f6f0d9495964bc3ce7f74d3dd9; 867eae3e270a8100229d96624ed93e9dd0dc15d9; ebf5c4e8697633422dd2c3b1f1cf1b524f5984d5; 160903594f5971be55ff83ab1acbe9dcfa3e8c14; fded6f9cefb06c1da7acddd5b9b89b1eabb08b7d; 17aac4c2e66f5f693dc17dd8b389444e9689c471; 4f7d1e04c9d30ce12df3e085d10d70997e6ea1a5; 0a9e0f409ae1fa6e6b5f9f0f89e095098dceb461; 005bb977412ffd7c7ef2fd89effd44cfbd8635f7; 772f5fca88de0f6f38116d73cc32e23efe780a10; ce57afbb2615fae75800ee6b8deaf2d6ff8c0a86; 36fa41f244561c759cff6b7f556e385e5fcb20c5; 572370d627a7eeb247a371d5bcb790b5c26fd12a; eb0a888c154675608fcb241b0c91ffc627fd1b26; a38b991df58d350a4ac19b5f8552eaeace38e2e1; 085589ca53509ad27edd95827f7198b3ce107024; 78ce0c149860363bbbe34306c75a4454ad23828d; 49054ecef281b676ac0aea93af11fbf1c2023cc2; a4a6b1f7a95fee9c755ef2f4feab9bf7482694d0; 3406ab66b099e346d11f0dde4f2f4e244bd327b1; 4221099f144c4384fa467c0733cfa5ebeccab5ac; e7adf166b24fdd8574f86a69ccf2ed69a38450cb; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; fad3cd73f2e5927595640d97375ea302b68caff1; c032b81df71c5b5745454ef5b2afa4f715cc3f92; 0446839238dc22746e99eb746ce11bc7e18f33b1; 3abdf6a56673224f37aa24ac5cd6e727ec79da93; a5eb8a1ef444b8bff58f8f453c914920f3a97a6c; 0d080e6cbe4c8d68af2f155c3d11cb79772f2ce3; 567a564f0abe3f6a2537fb29fee55f165aa54404; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; cb32999bb6b6c2754ddd904226ee0602522621a1; ace748df0e2971e1a2c300201e51ed11c3dbf3c9; 8d2af82f1a3d0ce28b9caad35b7b3772847a875a; b1d7700a45318a72a628692f3075050f136c1fac,bioRxiv,,
ab50d8661b6575502b87582d157987fb4de83ba0,Graph inference by multiple testing with application to Neuroimaging,"This thesis is motivated by the analysis of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The need for methods to build such structures from fMRI data gives rise to exciting new challenges for mathematics. In this regards, the brain connectivity networks are modelized by a graph and we study some procedures that allow us to infer this graph.More precisely, we investigate the problem of the inference of the structure of an undirected graphical model by a multiple testing procedure. The structure induced by both the correlation and the partial correlation are considered. The statistical tests based on the latter are known to be highly dependent and we assume that they have an asymptotic Gaussian distribution. Within this framework, we study some multiple testing procedures that allow a control of false edges included in the inferred graph.First, we theoretically examine the False Discovery Rate (FDR) control of Benjamini and Hochbergâ€™s procedure in Gaussian setting for non necessary positive dependent statistical tests. Then, we explore both the FDR and the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) control in asymptotic Gaussian setting. We present some multiple testing procedures, well-suited for correlation (resp. partial correlation) tests, which provide an asymptotic control of the FWER. Furthermore, some first theoretical results regarding asymptotic FDR control are established.Second, the properties of the multiple testing procedures that asymptotically control the FWER are illustrated on a simulation study, for statistical tests based on correlation. We finally conclude with the extraction of cerebral connectivity networks on real data set.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Marine Roux"", ids = ""48139086"")",,500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06; 9ee0b6db025fabc5ed568beb8ee1232dd66496f9; 43df40940722c09a776248ab4a090774dd29b704; 2a4a3c9b6aac9733e11c8860a5be1f2d32a617bd; a1379882981e14a86d5a49925bb38dfd49f817c8; 02d6f44a00b2e55867fc0feab6f6be0e5874cf9c; cfc459e33b420e0ed4ee2092424f56735cc7f6d9; 087f9482b1ad71e449c7ad758a3b235626168cc5; 3edfa91f9d75e7c84f1751c24f46871c3b4ee994; 4286db547a55ec49c57f5213c75937de240ebc95; bc55639dcb2d8cb372643c2336ed2dc85ddcaaed; a990d6a91a7a1c0a11dafc34753b9af143c1de56; e1687c574e5f0c972003d60a92e54afe7c780409; ef396559ba0b33879c7d3662d6c54ab901ba80a1; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; e1f27855ccb435f5c5e8ff98b575cb26d7a192c8; 2a1b0b2557e7f29fd5ef4c4a7403aaa0e30533bf; 91a95bf76f977328f95bf7e88ab7669ca29f96f1; b1c693783edf572c37ecbe3fc0508b44661a7b7e; f35dfefdd5c44c5e717e17bb72c273b22b0878f1; 4f906bfe6b28535b1d5bac2ac525bfabcf2d9369; 73ed1515be8e2d5bef6d0545aaea6258553f9d44; cedda598732ea3c959cc5bc6a596c1b303c5c54b; b06b3c03bec7dfcf3a0ae89e59680731fc5922f9; ef1bf316ce572888268aba556d8534768e8c816a; ede69fe32895a0a987aad3ba562845402d4a8437; c5a0ff2ce6c6e8e78f79fe98481aaafc0bdda417; 4c266531c59bd63464a0f0dcc31452642f634d7b; 04f9153967c7931d1ebaf3bbd281be6e3e474d16; 93075ab133bd44791ddb44cf70e4768bb6c3d6eb; b39228f7c35980c9c3a704cc86b303209eb77f0b; 44165956328b5d07c82d95e682648efcb09ecc8f; 60184ac85daa921b74c51876fbd32aaea6d6c669; 12951177aee55a7dc04139a6f5a849a578ad5e33; fc264e230970f3eed9d17a3def70863526b0b1bc; 5d072be87fb7f7cfa672623c9326db7d0b012539; 3cfa38fe844535c316416c4cba6d447dbc04c477; ef5d4979a2234857084099bf3894901c331c330f; b2cb8c76da40c2489babc3bb5db0fcd8e7b715d6; 7422bf1235464e121899b008e986c01f9a946a50; c5268708d4b57a1eb960b205aa8d897710526160; 73694794fed5f68ccfdaeda76a00eca4dea230ea; 591cb58da354853992d89c86cd25dd0f6d9f2e4f; 1abb0893ae3f746aef26e85ab451e01fd6cfb865; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; da2300084e48bc67915193183c89167502122a9e; 1086643c453895287174269eb2121491ef270c75; 6dd565146ac7ee734f9a60fdbe4bf054cd9e9a70; f16ac695acb70c088faabe8ae01206321a339a20; 79ee6103a4a8efa556693810d513216ba0a9cc7c; 98da9d46e4c442945bfd88db72be177e7a198fd3; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f; f49f32857fc137e87d5b367698555a3cb39c8b99; 05ab43b91321e8cf57a42614dd630baecd110bd0; 9a3edc623b5ffa7522ed8f37c01ce4b5125002ad; 8677162c4829102767d45c6cbcc132f4c2e166bc; 398ff09f1ef9fdc1d70f59eeb744f06c06998528; 46a3d89e4c69f0001fbe1ec7d16c5eb2879d529a; 9c749dfc75a76e7aedca212f333d76b7a9e7f8ad; 232ef656c8b2551084bcd46b5a6bf532944b51f8; 9ecae668ad78e5ab6ef099808fea219f815cf5c4; 350df3968308ffd8a3633708f17617ca768feb40; 225cbd16bf3f529c574866c0b48a21cd8e655601; 824b27c1c783e1b443f0eba7c62509a124ccecce; 35a757808fe9c48f6e59ef6ea8f5194a901a8d7f; 7cd1619370c1ab9b68acbb05d91b6562c78ed8a8; 9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6; 665c2732fd3b917371765f3e062759e613927496; 891e406fd9065ce03fb5310076e1a4ed18512870; f76de26cc9e89c122f8a83f1cda437797486476d; f95f216e071b07b908014b4e8aef5b916d85d8c3; faf9dd2bd68707c5615ff8b64dfd60351227b42b; 2d465a96ac54a6384dc4ebe6e5c63faec1a32d35; 0e7fd9422eaa403b80d708588d48b7d98abe5d63; e4ab1fbeeaebfc457fb16cd366cf4745feae5a9a; 93d617c2891e450ba8d5cd4149ba4fc38c962295; 3ace3864cc5ada47b31a74d8fea91edb48bc019d; 9e0a1c6b093c6fa1fbf03c617b0a1ac84db0f521; e68626651226168ecaee8325eb94faabb45b52ac; 0b991c7ac8f950ac5b5781cb01d0041146a84fb1; 00ba641aa89464931c943a69fcd77be5176837a9; 8c050fe179f709922e7becfe7af435c2ef31eed8; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; d28c5d665a1e0e4d7b0af67133950d2891d7d871; cb3efcd5de509f156420976977187a6311d12b6c; e76cf935c61e94791aacbc02047714bc988dc8e0; 7414b5d0c96169599d97a02ac276ef8de77fca5e; be1de0e96b28252583402ca4a1f9afc71d68f3c1; 1b79032ebafe8a3d908b094a0d4613f633f2c09c; 8167da8f76354349489c70d3a30ed93d18e9a1f0; d06798476ae907160dc4ec6b88be466fdcdb8b6d; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; af56f15bf6515b728edf24e3b9abdbdac28f23b7; 618a9b4b73ff6d087fdccea2a1a850a38152e2e5; d7203a27edddacbc573a29754bc192f7bedecaca; fe952e156775eae98375a0f668c58e85ed60dbea; 3d3b2a4f1ae4e029a43c22171cb61f3c56516d72; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263,,,

Therefore, we examined a four dimension profiling method, which includes low abundance protein enrichment, tryptic digestion and peptide fractionation by IEF, SCX and RP-LC. The application of peptide pI filtering as an additional criterion for the validation of the identifications allows to minimize the false discovery rate and to optimize the best settings of the protein identification database search engine. This sequential approach allows for the identification of low abundance proteins, such as angiogenin (10âˆ’9Â g/L), pigment epithelium growth factor (10âˆ’8Â g/L), hepatocyte growth factor activator (10âˆ’7Â g/L) and thrombospondin-1 (10âˆ’6Â g/L), having concentrations similar to those of many other growth factors and cytokines involved in disease pathophysiology.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Renato Millioni"", ids = ""4729160""); list(name = ""Serena Tolin"", ids = ""35663141""); list(name = ""Gian Paolo Fadini"", ids = ""3832122""); list(name = ""Marco Falda"", ids = ""48309917""); list(name = ""Bas van Breukelen"", ids = ""7292104""); list(name = ""Paolo Tessari"", ids = ""6595087""); list(name = ""Giorgio Arrigoni"", ids = ""144221138"")",d6bf1241ac6398cd32e874a7b39d219ecca2e3c5; bf043d0951fb70bf97d6d3e3294d5f6c3fe22d22; 7e93f29e10930e0baa49de146a97473dc3146f6e; 0e56c1ce5b0f601f74e7f39b951b2776b4cdce42,99cb2cc358d0a5bb7228b8aed006884d848f92d2; 38ec6b6baaeced067c9a574f43937717ec4d611d; f89116adc97c01ea49097e2ad4a42edec86d0cf4; 9eab3f20520460c586c7e5807392a792644a06ac; fe61274966ca7bb3b040723d299834e655ecd94c; b0f4caa2adcd9529544bc92387c66319da752bd8; 5d85977ffa380a4fe72229ccd6bb40723e28010c; 769b58b66d26b51ead5141e17e172a13e877f4f3; 748310bed8dedf5d39301af7a13dadaa548bd6e0; f501705abd458a65ab5e6859bbce22d89782b9dc; 8c117c3ca4c98c33342dc1c0b67bb7a59b6e036b; 30487d18ff662afa0cd85e85d515e7c0fffeff2d; 85932d86c511edf72fe07bd381103ea5b9dffb97; fbfb694ca8799a19b4b3b7845236779d081aaebf,Amino Acids,43,2199-2202
6811380c1541383947a93417043afee463cf3607,Valine Metabolism Is Altered in Obese Adolescents with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Relates to Insulin Sensitivity,"Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is common and associated with insulin resistance (IR). The mechanism of IR in PCOS is unclear, likely multifactorial, and may relate to branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and mitochondrial metabolism. We quantitated differences in BCAA and BCAA breakdown product short chain (C3-C5) acylcarnitines in response to hyperinsulinemia in obese girls with and without PCOS, and assessed the relationship to IR and hyperandrogenism. Obese girls with PCOS [n=15, 14.5 Â± 1.6 years, BMI %ile 98.5 Â± 1.0] and without PCOS [n=6; 13.2 Â± 1.2 years, BMI %ile 98.0 Â± 1.1] were studied. Insulin sensitivity was assessed with a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and a testosterone panel obtained. Nontargeted metabolomics were performed in plasma samples obtained before and after the clamp. T-tests were used for group comparisons, with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (false discovery rate (FDR) set to 0.05) to control for multiple testing. Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficient was calculated for BCAA vs. glucose infusion rate (GIR) and free androgen index (FAI). The groups had similar demographic, physical activity, diet attributes, HbA1c and lipids. Girls with PCOS had higher FAI and worse IR than controls. FAI related negatively to short chain acylcarnitines C4 (r = -0.74, p=0.0002) and C3 (r=-0.60, p =0.007). During hyperinsulinemia, girls with PCOS had higher valine (FDR-adjusted p=0.04) and lower valine breakdown product C4 butyrylcarnitine (FDR-adjusted p=0.01). End-clamp valine correlated with GIR (r= -0.59, p= 0.006) as did C4 butyrylcarnitine (r=0.44, p=0.04). Under hyperinsulinemia, a metabolomic signature was revealed in obese girls with PCOS, distinct from that in uncomplicated obesity. Valine was higher in girls with PCOS, while C4 acylcarnitine, its direct mitochondrial metabolite, was lower. Further work is needed to determine if BCAA metabolism is a modifiable target to improve insulin sensitivity or simply a useful biomarker. Disclosure A. Carreau: None. H. Rahat: None. Y.

043159fb18006336fac63cd60001474fb0e6bbc0,Deep RNA sequencing analysis of readthrough gene fusions in human prostate adenocarcinoma and reference samples,"BackgroundReadthrough fusions across adjacent genes in the genome, or transcription-induced chimeras (TICs), have been estimated using expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries to involve 4-6% of all genes. Deep transcriptional sequencing (RNA-Seq) now makes it possible to study the occurrence and expression levels of TICs in individual samples across the genome.MethodsWe performed single-end RNA-Seq on three human prostate adenocarcinoma samples and their corresponding normal tissues, as well as brain and universal reference samples. We developed two bioinformatics methods to specifically identify TIC events: a targeted alignment method using artificial exon-exon junctions within 200,000 bp from adjacent genes, and genomic alignment allowing splicing within individual reads. We performed further experimental verification and characterization of selected TIC and fusion events using quantitative RT-PCR and comparative genomic hybridization microarrays.ResultsTargeted alignment against artificial exon-exon junctions yielded 339 distinct TIC events, including 32 gene pairs with multiple isoforms. The false discovery rate was estimated to be 1.5%. Spliced alignment to the genome was less sensitive, finding only 18% of those found by targeted alignment in 33-nt reads and 59% of those in 50-nt reads. However, spliced alignment revealed 30 cases of TICs with intervening exons, in addition to distant inversions, scrambled genes, and translocations. Our findings increase the catalog of observed TIC gene pairs by 66%.We verified 6 of 6 predicted TICs in all prostate samples, and 2 of 5 predicted novel distant gene fusions, both private events among 54 prostate tumor samples tested. Expression of TICs correlates with that of the upstream gene, which can explain the prostate-specific pattern of some TIC events and the restriction of the SLC45A3-ELK4 e4-e2 TIC to ERG-negative prostate samples, as confirmed in 20 matched prostate tumor and normal samples and 9 lung cancer cell lines.ConclusionsDeep transcriptional sequencing and analysis with targeted and spliced alignment methods can effectively identify TIC events across the genome in individual tissues. Prostate and reference samples exhibit a wide range of TIC events, involving more genes than estimated previously using ESTs. Tissue specificity of TIC events is correlated with expression patterns of the upstream gene. Some TIC events, such as MSMB-NCOA4, may play functional roles in cancer.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Serban Nacu"", ids = ""2350540""); list(name = ""Wenlin Yuan"", ids = ""40239204""); list(name = ""Zhengyan Kan"", ids = ""38353617""); list(name = ""Deepali Bhatt"", ids = ""49274875""); list(name = ""Celina Sanchez Rivers"", ids = ""34720819""); list(name = ""Jeremy Stinson"", ids = ""1822779""); list(name = ""Brock A.

cbc34b0c86e017089a436975ff67f51f40754228,Habitual sleep and human plasma metabolomics,"IntroductionSleep plays an important role in cardiometabolic health. The sleep-wake cycle is partially driven by the endogenous circadian clock, which governs a range of metabolic pathways. The association between sleep and cardiometabolic health may be mediated by alterations of the human metabolome.ObjectivesTo better understand the biological mechanism underlying the association between sleep and health, we examined human plasma metabolites in relation to sleep duration and sleep timing.MethodsUsing an untargeted approach, 329 fasting plasma metabolites were measured in 277 Chinese participants. We measured sleep timing (midpoint between bedtime and wake up time) using repeated time-use surveys (4 weeks during 1 year) and previous night sleep duration from questionnaires completed before sample donation.ResultsWe found 64 metabolites that were associated with sleep timing with a false discovery rate of 0.2 or lower, after adjusting for potential confounders. Notably, we found that later sleep timing was associated with higher levels of multiple metabolites in amino acid metabolism, including branched chain amino acids and their gamma-glutamyl dipeptides. We also found widespread associations between sleep timing and numerous metabolites in lipid metabolism, including bile acids, carnitines and fatty acids. In contrast, previous night sleep duration was not associated with plasma metabolites in our study.ConclusionSleep timing was associated with a large number of metabolites across a variety of biochemical pathways. Some metabolite associations are consistent with a relationship between late chronotype and adverse effects on cardiometabolic health.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qian Xiao"", ids = ""40563657""); list(name = ""Andriy Derkach"", ids = ""144041260""); list(name = ""Steven C.

8d20e4608d6743ed25ff56b989b342eea80df7db,Identification of Genetic Polymorphisms Contributing to Risk in MDS Using Innovative GWAS Approaches.,"Abstract 734 

Genetic predisposition to MDS and AML is likely polygenic and may involve several low penetrance alleles which in concert with exogenous factors result in highly variable phenotype and late presentation, not easily amenable to genetic studies. With the advent of whole genome scanning (WGS) technologies utilizing various SNP array (SNP-A) platforms, large scale investigations in various disorders have been conducted. A systems level understanding of particular disease allows for identification of candidate genetic variants as prognostic or diagnostic markers. We have applied 6.0 SNP-A containing 924.644 SNP probes to conduct a comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) in MDS including sAML with the aim of identifying low prevalence genetic variants that contribute to individual disease risk. We have studied 189 patients with MDS and sAML and a cohort of 2230 controls. After exclusion of SNP's with call rate of <95% and those with violation of Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (p<.01), 809.802 SNPs (87.5% of initial set) were passed for further investigation. Single allele Ï‡2 for all autosomal markers was performed. A set of 3600 SNP's pointing towards genes with minor allele frequency (MAF) <10% and p<.001 after Bonferroni correction (more conservative multiple hypothesis correction than False Discovery Rate) were selected. Out of 38 significant non-synonymous SNPs 3 were selected, while 3/64 exonic non synonymous SNPs were prioritized for final investigation. These included [rs805267][1], rs2499953 and rs2681417 pointing towards LY6G5B with (OR 4.9), MMP26 (OR 4.7) and CD86 (OR2.9), respectively. LY6G5B gene was represented by marker rs4656334 (p<1Ã—10â€“12) occurring at the heterozygous frequency of 16.3% vs. 5.4% in controls, and in homozygous frequency of 4.1% vs. 0.04% in controls resulting in MAF of 12.2% vs. 2.7% in controls (p<1Ã—10-12). Rs2499953 and rs2499956 pointed towards MMP26 and was found in the heterozygous variant in 17.0% vs. 3.7% in controls. CD86 gene was represented by singular rs2681417 marker (p<1Ã—10â€“7) occurring at the heterozygous frequency of 29.0% vs. 13.6% frequency in controls, and in homozygous frequency of 4.0% vs. 0.4% in controls. The 3/3536 strongest intronic SNPs included rs4656334, rs4647493 and [rs700060][2] and directed via LD to informative genes ATF6 with odds 3.15, FANCC (OR 135.3) and RABGAP1 (OR 37.1) respectively. Of interest is that ATF6/Î±aRheb-mTOR signalling promotes survival of dormant tumour cells in vivo. ATF6 gene was represented by marker rs4656334 (p<1Ã—10â€“7) and occurred at a heterozygous frequency of 7% vs. 8.3% in controls, while the homozygous constellation was 7 Ã— higher in patients (14.6% vs. 2.4% in controls) with the corresponding MAF of 18.0 vs. 6.5%. Another 2 SNPs within this locus were highly significant (rs16860777, p<1Ã—10â€“6; and rs12401299, p<1Ã—10â€“6). Second potential locus identified in our study ( FANCC gene ) was represented by singular rs4647493 marker (p<1Ã—10â€“20) occurring at the heterozygous frequency of 16.9% vs. 0.05% in controls. RABGAP1 gene was represented by singular [rs700060][2] marker (p<1Ã—10â€“17) occurring at the heterozygous frequency of 13.9% vs. allelic frequency of 0.3% in controls. While these results of analysis targeting individual SNP provide intriguing research avenues, such an approach offers only limited understanding of the complex genetic traits as not an individual SNP, but rather a joint action of several SNPs results in particular outcomes. Consequently, in study of MDS, we applied the network gene association analysis as a new paradigm incorporating both â€œoperator ORâ€ and â€œoperator ANDâ€ thereby allowing for dependence and independence testing and possibly, to identification of meaningful pathways. We performed a simulation study, where genotypes were drawn including homozygous reference, heterozygous and homozygous variant for each SNP Si = 1,â€¦ 64 where the MAF of SNP is chosen uniformly at random. We have identified [rs236113][3] and rs2499953 ( MCM8 and MMP26 ), both in homozygous variant with occurrence of 19% in patients and 1.8% in controls at a specificity score 98.2% and p<1Ã—10â€“32. Accordingly the presence of both SNP's increases relative risk given the specificity when both SNPs are present. In sum, our study constituted the first network analyses of predisposing factors taken in consideration as groups and identified informative loci that can lead to delineation of causative genetic profiles.

4fada95911ff3934b85441ff6960968f8b580881,An adaptive significance threshold criterion for massive multiple hypotheses testing,"This research deals with massive multiple hypothesis testing. First regarding multiple tests as an estimation problem under a proper population model, an error measurement called Erroneous Rejection Ratio (ERR) is introduced and related to the False Discovery Rate (FDR). ERR is an error measurement similar in spirit to FDR, and it greatly simplifies the analytical study of error properties of multiple test procedures. Next an improved estimator of the proportion of true null hypotheses and a data adaptive significance threshold criterion are developed. Some asymptotic error properties of the significant threshold criterion is established in terms of ERR under distributional assumptions widely satisfied in recent applications. A simulation study provides clear evidence that the proposed estimator of the proportion of true null hypotheses outperforms the existing estimators of this important parameter in massive multiple tests. Both analytical and simulation studies indicate that the proposed significance threshold criterion can provide a reasonable balance between the amounts of false positive and false negative errors, thereby complementing and extending the various FDR control procedures.

d467ca60e8d40740925dbc631d9d16aa49777c41,Principal Component Analysis of Proteome Dynamics in Iron-starved Mycobacterium Tuberculosis.,"The goal of this study is to use principal component analysis (PCA) for multivariate analysis of proteome dynamics based on both protein abundance and turnover information generated by high-resolution mass spectrometry. We previously reported assessing protein dynamics in iron-starved Mycobacterium tuberculosis, revealing interesting interconnection among the cellular processes involving protein synthesis, degradation, and secretion (Anal. Chem. 80, 6860-9). In this study, we use target-decoy database search approach to select peptides for quantitation at a false discovery rate of 4.2%. We further use PCA to reduce the data dimensions for simpler interpretation. The PCA results indicate that the protein turnover and relative abundance properties are approximately orthogonal in the data space defined by the first three principal components. We show the potential of the Hotelling's T2 (T2) value as a quantifiable index for comparing changes between protein functional categories. The T2 value represents the gross change of a protein in both abundance and turnover. Close examination of the antigen 85 complex demonstrates that T2 correctly predicts the coordinated changes of the antigen 85 complex proteins. The multi-dimensional protein dynamics data further reveal the secretion of the antigen 85 complex. Overall, this study demonstrates PCA as an effective means to facilitate interpretation of the multivariate proteome dynamics dataset which otherwise would remain a significant challenge using traditional methods.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Prahlad Rao"", ids = ""144361141""); list(name = ""Qingbo Li"", ids = ""34703252"")",e8ae7bfe494f346ce7cba01db9c05ff250d557f7; 01f7a814a6908e73f59f14f4fdef31e433355554; 9425668cb8ff890c47902de1a96b1e64823c74b1; ac5a155223c1a8bad638da196f0688c822ef1f0a; 8093fbddd95bb0d7d8ce60675ba0a93f0c42d0ff; 16591db6b5c912e50feecf36a6523930fd1e6c4c; c9dbe0520c06ea1c5edd31683ce8734cd3d970e4; 6328f51aa428dddc1eebb0baeec3a6d6d46df66f; 37a7cece370eee9c2538eaf072a136100a2bf5e2; a1c12babdd432a4b6e8776c29e34c7f6e8175865; 1dc03a73e2ea30e9f6ca82a83fe0457dbd5b80de; 8dd7e77b3cf84d74bd4ce2c7b3d74477e672b974; eee1da2d224fb0af5368b3f7b73ac12d76a6de43; 9f341a91e5e315d2205ced0ddef776b71a4d9037; 32c2bdaf7c6df6769350e96c996da4375cf104ae; 1cf526f91a355912eadae6b114b00586dd0f7318; 48000597a1b215d9394b6d50dc4065257f89cef1; da4e49c5960f8dca31b86931b1f76ab0caf99aa7; 3a8a53f3b6942f195d35d04e9428cfce24ac26aa; 97898345551e4f49beee5f4dfefd5f02c8e1bee6,9f459d38e63b3400557b83684724bb421725e406; d74bd0765c3a5ee0f5c84c8ea98cea3f76128bdd; 6e18dc01f2475b103f72315755debf4316f884c9; f0f96cf39d8e4a539661edc3b2521b45c0a1786e; ff5c0db4015d018c496c933f341b4217b028cf04; 2e7b21695b375d248e2d0f72e0d6394a3b7b21db; be60b1f21a3f6404558a66b2d11a2015ffa39a08; 6150801e4a272197021161d369d63436a6aa7655; 5b08b0234d0a3b8e821ef50db8d3bc072a4eb7d0; 7ebacb099ee01c314f09e8faf6b3786a6cd5abb2; 3b024a52c8d3666f728e84a0393bb86d2f91f176; de11dd952cc5b298d295f0a3e3a5fd0b3ba04157; 362110141a8ef31c9701e53017844c3595c4ea11; 1ef83b2b980b406db708adb6104533be05af9854; 71ff74936bdc4fa6f41e81da6988c77d7238ea88; 0779f341bbfbe4565f657b98806c2f68b661fb92; aac4d5d1e4ea062126e49153a7c99d48dc6e41f6; fea2bc50ce263f68a401c5b958b24523b8e66116; dbb81b9d2598f6495479032750b220f93c60d231; a9c21aacd2d8e6eac1155d12c8284343925759bf; 5536fd5ddaca80b77d8f9d76940f92eb376da815; 787261a0a82725f6c205ae674a6350e44fa82c1c; 6b4df5c87e7e95471c3e0a0cc80db9ee68e90a9b; dcf92caa2d150bf9cc19d1c8bf6029ef7f3438fd; 43f3712ca31403bce8e760163a4d4d56cf06ac7b; e0f9470f0cf24328b41905367662b67ed38a16f2; 667b43c8adad628c60c20810197cdeec6679714e; 5e5aa78b3027d3623c7395cae12a2a0bb9600273; c4089e6ccc6d0fff4f78ae529508d7e7a285ebec; 37ac3e98bbbeeb55592edfaea09821ca4a6d4fd0,Journal of proteomics & bioinformatics,2 1,"

7ad99e59e5aa8257a32c3e0ff8895955122dcf4c,FreeHi-C simulates high-fidelity Hi-C data for benchmarking and data augmentation,The ability to simulate high-throughput chromatin conformation (Hi-C) data is foundational for benchmarking Hi-C data analysis methods. Here we present a nonparametric strategy named FreeHi-C to simulate Hi-C data from the interacting genome fragments. Data from FreeHi-C exhibit high fidelity to biological Hi-C data. FreeHi-C boosts the precision and power of differential chromatin interaction detection through data augmentation under preserved false discovery rate control.FreeHi-C takes Hi-C sequencing data as input and simulates reads with random mutations and indels from the interacting fragment pairs. FreeHi-C-simulated replicates are used for benchmarking Hi-C analysis methods and enable data augmentation for differential chromatin interaction analysis.,2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ye Zheng"", ids = ""46323282""); list(name = ""SÃ¼ndÃ¼z KeleÅŸ"", ids = ""152766143"")",,1823026160626ed2cd47de840d3829a7bb2ebb38; 564e224da06efb083bb33c7e31288b201653a923; 1773b939a85a4b39170d6ed7bd23c1017a6d8866; fcec9d3217698186b001cf4c833635f190bb531a; 67c9f1804707ac11a02855c1fe84e9d6766ed7df; 817fc8de25f989b8229847fc7710750f273460b6; f4a27e71e71aac070d8d1c8d70ce3543772d25d9; ecb90f00c4821f659390610e82b284b34445fa04; a7b828436e60b8b2e978463bce06864b0a2ee6bd; ef3f722c720c3c701d590d1a93d597d694027a8d; 6c028691e7b9cdf8255d5bc6b5fe0ab72b505702; 6e496c389795d7d426c31b171ddc8e1659e435bf; 428ea572e04a2553c94cb4d71bb42f80394b3798; e6ea8e2219f5c914d22fe20c111db2f999f04e05; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; d4ceca31b7f32cdc7c53ff6d93dcb270c4542185; d58051d8fd71bbfd9ed5a172bc0ecc0ce4055c04; 7162b2582ce0f75564b4b290a2e205e58ed974b6; e1e0e7f8723d517bed7c39382eb4bcee3172f8ac; b95d4aff1287a8c3f4bb78a659de9646059b36a5; 4870fc7fdad70722cb833827294f117b50394a8e; 3a771dd40873131c4583896708fce0e2756dc4a5; 0dade66448a513114b43319a0dee5a2ebb50869d; eb9a0cf8f006fa24eea5af405c7f088073e486a1,Nature Methods,17,37-40

Neste estudo foram utilizados 285 animais da raca Canchim e 114 animais do grupo genetico MA (utilizados na formacao da raca Canchim), genotipados com o painel de alta densidade (786.799 SNPs). Apos o controle de qualidade de informacoes (genotipos e fenotipos) restaram 672.778 SNPs e 392 animais. Foram observadas associacoes para PED nos cromossomos 20 e 28. Apos a correcao para multiplos testes (?false discovery rate?) ao nivel de 10%, 12 SNPs foram significativamente associados, ao longo do cromossomo, com PED. Novos e promissores genes associados com caracteristicas reprodutivas foram identificados, como os genes SRD5A1 (steroid-5- alpha-reductase, alpha polypeptide 1), NSUN2 (NOP2/Sun domain family, member 2) e LOC100297493 (Odorant-binding protein-like). Estes genes podem ser destacados, pois os dois primeiros parecem atuar no crescimento corporal; desenvolvimento do sistema reprodutivo de machos devido a producao de hormonios androgenos e espermatogenese; enquanto que o ultimo atua no sistema olfativo. As regioes polimorficas identificadas apresentaram funcoes moleculares e processos biologicos que podem estar envolvidas na manutencao do organismo e no desempenho reprodutivo de machos.

ec2d7bfddb4ede6a37f85b9d065e6bc03133d8f3,Integrated platform for manual and high-throughput statistical validation of tandem mass spectra.,"As proteomic data sets increase in size and complexity, the necessity for database-centric software systems able to organize, compare, and visualize all the proteomic experiments in a lab grows. We recently developed an integrated platform called high-throughput autonomous proteomic pipeline (HTAPP) for the automated acquisition and processing of quantitative proteomic data, and integration of proteomic results with existing external protein information resources within a lab-based relational database called PeptideDepot. Here, we introduce the peptide validation software component of this system, which combines relational database-integrated electronic manual spectral annotation in Java with a new software tool in the R programming language for the generation of logistic regression spectral models from user-supplied validated data sets and flexible application of these user-generated models in automated proteomic workflows. This logistic regression spectral model uses both variables computed directly from SEQUEST output in addition to deterministic variables based on expert manual validation criteria of spectral quality. In the case of linear quadrupole ion trap (LTQ) or LTQ-FTICR LC/MS data, our logistic spectral model outperformed both XCorr (242% more peptides identified on average) and the X!Tandem E-value (87% more peptides identified on average) at a 1% false discovery rate estimated by decoy database approach.",2009,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kebing Yu"", ids = ""47841113""); list(name = ""Anthony Sabelli"", ids = ""3145900""); list(name = ""Lisa DeKeukelaere"", ids = ""15574548""); list(name = ""Richard Park"", ids = ""47286910""); list(name = ""Suzanne Sindi"", ids = ""46503578""); list(name = ""Constantine Gatsonis"", ids = ""3588784""); list(name = ""Arthur R.

We used an electronic health record (EHR) technique to test for differences in comorbidities in African Americans compared to Caucasians with SLE.MethodsWe used a de-identified EHR with 2.8 million subjects to identify SLE cases using a validated algorithm. We performed phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) comparing African American to Caucasian SLE cases and African American SLE cases to matched non-SLE controls. Controls were age, sex, and race matched to SLE cases. For multiple testing, a false discovery rate (FDR) p value of 0.05 was used.ResultsWe identified 270 African Americans and 715 Caucasians with SLE and 1425 matched African American controls. Compared to Caucasians with SLE adjusting for age and sex, African Americans with SLE had more comorbidities in every organ system. The most striking included hypertension odds ratio (OR) = 4.25, FDR p = 5.49 Ã— 10âˆ’ 15; renal dialysis OR = 10.90, FDR p = 8.75 Ã— 10âˆ’ 14; and pneumonia OR = 3.57, FDR p = 2.32 Ã— 10âˆ’ 8. Compared to the African American matched controls without SLE, African Americans with SLE were more likely to have comorbidities in every organ system. The most significant codes were renal and cardiac, and included renal failure (OR = 9.55, FDR p = 2.26 Ã— 10âˆ’ 40) and hypertensive heart and renal disease (OR = 8.08, FDR p = 1.78 Ã— 10âˆ’ 22). Adjusting for race, age, and sex in a model including both African American and Caucasian SLE cases and controls, SLE was independently associated with renal, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases (all p <â€‰0.01).ConclusionsAfrican Americans with SLE have an increased comorbidity burden compared to Caucasians with SLE and matched controls.

Sixteen phenotypic traits associated with major health indices were observed biennially for 6843 individuals with 10-year follow-up in a Korean community-based cohort. Average SNP heritability and longitudinal changes in the total period were estimated using a two-stage model. Average and periodic differences for each subject were considered responses to estimate SNP heritability. Furthermore, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed for significant SNPs. Each SNP heritability for the phenotypic mean of all sixteen traits through 6 periods (baseline and five follow-ups) were significant.

We tested different amounts of bisulfite-converted (bs) DNA from six FFPE ovarian carcinomas (OC) of serous, endometrioid, and clear cell histologies and two HapMap constitutional genomes to evaluate the performance of the GoldenGate methylation assay. Methylation status at each 1,505 CpG site was expressed as Î²-values. Comparing 400â€‰ng versus 250â€‰ng bsDNA, reproducibility of the assay ranged from Spearman r(2) = 0.41 to 0.90, indicating that Î²-values obtained with a lower DNA amount did not always correlate well with the higher amount. Average methylation for the six samples was higher using 250â€‰ng (Î²-value = 0.45, SD = 0.29) than with 400â€‰ng (Î²-value = 0.36, SD = 0.32). Reproducibility between duplicate HapMap samples (r(2) = 0.76 to 0.92) was also variable. Using 400â€‰ng input bsDNA, THBS2 and ERG were differentially methylated across all histologic types and between endometrioid and clear cell types at <0.1% false discovery rate. Methylation did not always correlate with gene expression (r(2) = -0.70 to 0.15). We found that lower bsDNA overestimates methylation, and, using higher bsDNA amounts, we confirmed a previous report of higher methylation of THBS2 in clear cell OC, which could provide new insight into biological pathways that distinguish OC histological types.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Linda E.

fca21c5ea62a3f4bfde73dfc93650ac05f5663f8,Non-targeted Plasma Metabolomic Profile at Early and Late Lactation in Parity 1 Dams with Diverging Body Composition at Weaning,"Following Lactation is an extremely energy demanding event, impacting naÃ¯ve dams to a greater extent as they are still physiologically immature. The objective of the current study was to determine if a unique plasma metabolome exists at early and late lactation from first parity gilts having similar body measurements and litter sizes post-farrow (PF) with divergent body condition measurements at weaning. Farrowing data, body composition traits (bodyweight, backfat thickness, and loin eye area), and a plasma sample were collected PF (2.7 Â± 1.45 d) and 1d prior to weaning (WN) from composite Landrace-Duroc-Yorkshire gilts bred with Yorkshire semen. Twenty-seven gilts were identified from 68 first parity farrowings with similar farrowing ages (P = 0.9442), PF body weight (P = 0.6789), PF backfat thickness (P = 0.8549), and litter size (P â‰¥ 0.2263). Dams were fed to appetite from d3 PF through WN. Of the 27 dams, 10 with the greatest (Hi) and 10 with the least (Lo) body weight loss (P Ë‚ 0.0001; 26.1 Â± 1.90 kg and 8.6 Â± 1.48 kg, respectively) and backfat thickness loss (P = 0.0094; 4.7 Â± 0.86 mm and 1.3 Â± 0.67 mm, respectively) had plasma samples submitted for non-targeted profiling by UPLC-MS and GC-MS techniques. Raw spectral data was processed using XCMS package in R to generate feature detection and alignment followed by grouping of features into compounds. Samples were blocked by time of collection (PF and WN) and body condition loss (Hi and Lo) and ANOVA was performed on each compound in R with a Benjamini-Hochburg false discovery rate adjustment. Several compound changes (P â‰¤ 0.05) in the metabolome occurred from PF to WN under both detection techniques (UPLC-MS, 112; GC-MS, 59). While changes (P â‰¤ 0.05) in compounds between Hi loss and Lo loss also occurred, the prevalence was much less (UPLC-MS, 21; GC-MS, 11). Interestingly, the interaction of time by body condition loss yielded unique compound profiles for both detection techniques (UPLC-MS, 16; GC-MS, 20). Of the 36 compounds significant for interactions, 11 compound signatures may prove to be relevant as predictors for animals that will or wonâ€™t lose excessive weight and backfat thickness during the course of lactation. Further investigations into the specific identities and validation of all significant compounds will provide potential nutraceuticals to offset intensive depletion of energy stores in young dams during lactation.

18dad71aaa06f87c2e1a0f3bc5e47ecb91bae5b7,An 8-week Controlled Feeding Trial Based on the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans Has Minimal Effect on the Fecal Microbiota in Overweight and Obese Women (FS11-08-19).,"Objectives
To determine whether a high quality diet based on the 2010 Dietary Guidelines of America (DGA) alters the composition of the fecal microbiome in individuals at risk for cardiometabolic disease, compared to a diet based on a typical American diet (TAD).


Methods
A total of 52 overweight and obese women were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, controlled feeding trial. Women were randomly assigned to the DGA or TAD group (nÂ =Â 28 DGA and 24 TAD). Diets matched each participant's estimated energy requirement and subjects remained weight-stable. The DGA diet was based on the 2010 DGA food-group recommendations, whereas the TAD diet was based on the average adult intake patterns from the NHANES 2009-2010 survey. Participants provided a stool sample 1-week prior to intervention (W0), within the second week of diet intervention (W2), and at the final week of intervention (W8). Microbial profiles were assessed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and expressed as median % relative abundance. Data analyses were performed using standardized pipelines (QIIME 1.9 and R packages). False Discovery Rate (FDR) was set at 0.2.


Results
No differences were found in Î±- and Î²-diversity indices at the operational taxomonic unit (OTU) level by diet assignment at W0, and no taxa were differentially abundant at FDRÂ <Â 0.2. Similarly, Î±- and Î²-diversity indices (OTU level) were not altered by diet within W2 or W8. A single OTU within the Ruminococcus genera was higher in TAD at both W2 (TADÂ =Â 0.014%; DGAÂ =Â 0.00%) and W8 (TADÂ =Â 0.017%; DGAÂ =Â 0.00%; FDRÂ <Â 0.05), and the Adlercreutzia genera from the Actinobacteria phyla was also higher in TAD at both W2 (TADÂ =Â 0.027%; DGAÂ =Â 0.001%) and W8 (TADÂ =Â 0.022%; DGAÂ =Â 0.002%). No within-diet differences between W0 and W2, and W0 and W8 were observed in any Î±- and Î²-diversity indices tested. When adjusting for W0 relative abundances, 10 OTUs were altered by diet at W2 and 39 OTUs were altered at W8.


Conclusions
A weight-maintaining diet based on the 2010 DGA minimally differed in the fecal microbiota compared to a weight-maintaining typical American diet. Results herein suggests differences in food-based dietary patterns does not have a large effect on the composition of the fecal microbiota in humans.

A preliminary prospective analysis of a neural biomarker of CL injury risk,"Objectives: We aimed to present a unique prospective neurological dataset for participants who experienced an ACL injury. Design: Prospective longitudinal case-control. Methods: High school female soccer athletes were evaluated using functional magnetic resonance imaging to capture resting-state brain connectivity prior to their competitive season. Two of these athletes later experienced an ACL injury (ACLI). We matched these ACLI participants with eight teammates who did not go on to sustain an ACL injury (uninjured controls, Con) based on age, grade, sex, height, and weight to examine differences in preseason connectivity. Knee-motor regions of interest (ROIs) were created based on previously published data from which five specific areas were selected as seeds for analysis. Independent-samples t-tests with a false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons determined differences in connectivity between the ACLI and Con. Results: There was significantly greater connectivity between the left primary sensory cortex (a brain region responsible for proprioception) and the right posterior lobe of the cerebellum (a brain region responsible for balance and coordination) for the Con relative to ACLI, t (8) = 4.53, p = 0.03 (false discovery rate corrected). Conclusions: These preliminary data indicate that those who do not later sustain an ACL injury exhibit a stronger functional connection between a cortical sensory-motor region and a cerebellar region responsible for balance and coordination. These findings may help to guide development of brain-driven biofeedback training that optimizes and promotes adaptive neuroplasticity to reduce motor coordination 201 errors and injury risk.",2018,,"list(name = ""ed A.

86bc9404430b14ace6c608381747f4cb9888f41b,A statistical approach in using cDNA array analysis to determine modest changes in gene expression in several brain regions after neurotoxic insult.,"Modest changes in gene expression of three-fold or less might be expected after mild to moderate neurotoxic exposure to classes of compounds, such as the substituted amphetamines, or at time points that are weeks after more severe neurotoxic exposures. When many genes appear to change expression by less than two-fold, it is crucial to run several pairs of arrays and use statistical analysis to determine which genes are really changing. This limits the number of genes that have to undergo the time consuming task of performing RT-PCR to validate change in expression levels. We describe here methods for statistically determining which genes are being expressed above background levels. These methods are used to compare expression differences among the striatum, parietal cortex, posterior lateral amygdaloid nucleus, and substantia nigra brain regions, all of which differ significantly in their gene expression profiles. In these comparisons, it was possible to distinguish differences among hundreds of genes with manageable estimated false discovery rates. The effect of amphetamine treatment on gene expression in posterior lateral amygdaloid nucleus was also evaluated. The expression data indicate that many genes have changed, but in this case it is more difficult to separate affected genes from false positives.

67851655ac36b622570185848cfe4d17099ec8b7,Abstract 2787: Identifying predictive markers of endocrine response in high-grade serous ovarian cancer using RNA sequencing,"Epithelial ovarian cancer is a complex disease and patients vary considerably in response to treatment. A subset of patients responds well to endocrine therapy, however hormone receptor positivity does not predict response and there are no biomarkers in clinical use to help select patients that would benefit from endocrine agents. We aimed to identify markers of endocrine response in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) by analysis of genes that are differentially expressed in tumors from patients that are endocrine responders compared with non-responders, combined with analysis of estrogen (E2) regulated genes that differ between E2 sensitive and E2 insensitive HGSOC cell lines. Methods: Among women recruited to the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study, we identified 10 HGSOC patients treated with endocrine therapy (5 responders and 5 non-responders, based on GCIG CA125 response criteria) and performed RNAseq on cryopreserved tumor tissue. We also utilized paired E2 receptor (ER) positive HGSOC cell lines, derived from the same patient, with differential sensitivity to the growth effect of E2, PEO1 (E2 insensitive) and PEO4 (E2 sensitive). RNA was extracted following treatment with 0.1 nM E2 (or vehicle) for 24 hrs and gene expression changes in response to E2 were determined using RNAseq. Expression of selected ER responsive genes was validated using PCR array. Differential gene expression was determined using EdgeR. Pathway and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes were performed using Metacore. Results: Between endocrine responders and non-responders, 27 genes were significantly differentially expressed (False Discovery Rate (FDR) Conclusion: The use of RNAseq in both tumors and cell line models was able to identify plausible sets of genes with prior evidence of association with endocrine sensitivity. In breast cancer, ANO1 has been associated with good prognosis following tamoxifen treatment, while NOTCH signaling, implicated in endocrine resistance, is negatively regulated by NRARP. Further validation is required to test the utility of these genes as predictive biomarkers that may aid in identifying HGSOC patients likely to respond to endocrine treatment.

85d3056c1ddb75e8a1e9844c4526b2cdf8b7936c,Limited evidence for evolutionarily conserved targeting of long non-coding RNAs by microRNAs,"BackgroundLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of cell physiology, but it is yet unknown to what extent lncRNAs have evolved to be targeted by microRNAs. Comparative genomics has previously revealed widespread evolutionarily conserved microRNA targeting of protein-coding mRNAs, and here we applied a similar approach to lncRNAs.FindingsWe used a map of putative microRNA target sites in lncRNAs where site conservation was evaluated based on 46 vertebrate species. We compared observed target site frequencies to those obtained with a random model, at variable prediction stringencies. While conserved sites were not present above random expectation in intergenic lncRNAs overall, we observed a marginal over-representation of highly conserved 8-mer sites in a small subset of cytoplasmic lncRNAs (12 sites in 8 lncRNAs at 56% false discovery rate, P = 0.10).ConclusionsEvolutionary conservation in lncRNAs is generally low but patch-wise high, and these patches could, in principle, harbor conserved target sites. However, while our analysis efficiently detected conserved targeting of mRNAs, it provided only limited and marginally significant support for conserved microRNA-lncRNA interactions. We conclude that conserved microRNA-lncRNA interactions could not be reliably detected with our methodology.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Babak Alaei-Mahabadi"", ids = ""1404865489""); list(name = ""Erik Larsson"", ids = ""145353250"")",b7f9131eba62ffff959472eb0b992f7c1d11e9c4; e6f279cb3f8a7a68277cdab6e8c139b7953362f5; df97853c64b2a399554c3e197ad3ebbc38d43cd1,222dba366d02dd5fc1dbf691da2a98b0e5b796a7; 477d4ec44798ae14061949a4fd967cbee42644ee; eabd2d0b524614fd87fb14e2b4a7a0b87cdd9efb; 5272f35538c6b69806971b19d2f9b59640daedf9; d387847494decc85c5c907f959cb0803250296c3; eb02eb2b7ab89f7e09e1d87161a529f3a384ee2d; a5f37f4ec5d1797a5e19529a1a40ff96357167dd; 2677c8aa5ebe0647f1fd7245878e83ca8dab52f5; e81c863466c0a0b341b52bf73d23b6aa92cc946d; deab2e6a0b69a7e0e9031e3e9bd751fc41aab577; 790a730621508527088abb1515c189ba6f6c4661; 405e441f36ed3fb03b58f8ac52014a1e148daa70; 8343234c3fe68ce13dd693944142d101521c4167; 6755c6404f18448f165dd0c602399c394b3b0f08; 2830cf5a89339af3ccf8cad2a31ac01e027ad2e4; f95d058d88d28d33494f222a585d07614a7fd01f; 7de8b5ce383f19493ec3b1407115970229885b61; 659626ab31647f8a5a82802e07fa5a41bcac6a1e; 069d12215ee61278f190a7ff1e2c26dfefa7a25e; deafd8b5ef7236c3f8b0895d25e1f073fb9291cb; a338877a6c9e8a0f4efc90bbfb10ac6ef5895d96; 6620acaaa45b4dba79a4dfeddaa6f22ccb24077f; 2a2e5cfffe3c6b569e3b3311b699b482e96fe0c6; 3a6a1300d6c664422ceed16be7b2c9450158643c; 9977f78cd1496fba0ca5525bf515c79e9028c30e; 6ca7ac1ecde20b48749bdfba3cbaa02339e3a454; f1bfbfea4eb2e8e4b73ebe6dc1775e28c74cf727,Silence,4,4 - 4
b3f5880292dc175ce56736897ecd9abf8b9d842f,Proteomic profiling of endothelium-dependent vasodilation,"Objective: As endothelial dysfunction is an early event in atherosclerosis formation, we investigated if proteins previously related to cardiovascular disease also were related to endothelial function using a novel targeted proteomics approach. Methods: In the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study (nâ€Š=â€Š850â€“970, all aged 70 years), endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDV) in the forearm was assessed by intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine. Flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) was investigated in the brachial artery by ultrasound. The same investigations were carried out in the Prospective investigation of Obesity, Energy and Metabolism (POEM) study (nâ€Š=â€Š375â€“461, all aged 50 years). After strict quality control, 84 cardiovascular-related proteins measured by the proximity extension assay were studied in relation to EDV and FMD in PIVUS (discovery sample) and POEM (validation sample). Results: Of the 15 proteins being significantly related to EDV in PIVUS (false discovery rate <0.025), seven could be replicated in POEM at nominal significance and same effect direction when adjusted for sex and storage time. Of those, only cathepsin D remained significant following further adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors (beta, âˆ’0.08; 95% confidence interval, âˆ’0.16, âˆ’0.01; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.033; change in ln-transformed EDV per 1-SD increase in protein level). No protein was significantly related to FMD. Conclusion: Using a discovery/validation approach in two samples, our results indicate an inverse association between plasma cathepsin D levels and endothelial-dependent vasodilation.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lars Lind"", ids = ""2813823""); list(name = ""Johan SundstrÃ¶m"", ids = ""144023638""); list(name = ""Johan Ã„rnlÃ¶v"", ids = ""4998047""); list(name = ""Erik Ingelsson"", ids = ""2105755"")",,e8d05b727320787794347b7dfb02e493d08b7187; 69be32c9d116a13571312f00bd8b96b2156016b8; 7ff142dd9cdc04d24091596af4ce930fd5834941; 1a9dd03652d6ad5f38f25cec3c54e0dbd20e7b92; 84975c6e50fc9f37e2bc0de86fd1eb617ce9e2a7; d902e896019a96efc05ae57f2cce12aeb160559f; 1805fa2b1dc82868b7b34a08b59479e66368df57; 0954d2bfebb4a0f76aba57b66d8610aa6f185db9; 29d68c6c9bfe854ba42fd6276556a985f995688b; d87e75022b1582c959fbdb56fa7c0902890bd4c4; 05f4fbacba76aefbe61d76664dd0f5df379fb0c3; 7c44a150a842c161450cef51ef761db9c010ccd9; 5b52b511731faae5e536345f4f16cf5792f8b350; 195c9c30d45e302859c882749e751ea2c238abab; 2603a0002df7beb71a9fc557c43afe308bcfca3d; ced12956b07512d600aed6b2b74de946cfeb891c; bcc9b887cd9dde88b242b1cd20cebbf525b0f89d; f898c4772ddf2985cb5bb64f42f6acfc26228429; 7a5b594c30003542870b8a3c292d38d360b67c1c; 3385639d987f702337bf73fb506127f903309a21; 582272cad2afaed0108014ccb8aca068e90730af; 60ddbf981e1b13f78cae65ecf098f808acb9e925; 2fe94650c4723fa81fe9a67cfc1acd85832a52a2; df12341c1f6620e9a774d8b14e2105a5210b3e31; 6efc6de74d698443a5f9ced4967965fa82c0a0b7; 028d7655f29d788c70872d42e9d6346e97ece05d; 8b8768a9fd27a42808b7d58bfe99361d3ad96e26; 7971a95d4905dc5dda5d13696a82d8ddbd29a627; 76d163cf0b4da094443e18f0c7149eb3bc453c1b; 7d995bfd5be087001c3d9370822d2b34456e772f; f18f3842bc9d7069c7a99241b489882dbb0a7610; 0db589ac5b631419ec767a617538e6bebd91c904; c14729112b17378450ef33d9056d32521355fd43,Journal of Hypertension,37,216â€“222
81acb45dee9c25e68c2405aca8236c7720915b4f,Strong consistency and asymptotic normality for quantities related to the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg false discovery rate procedure,"Abstract The Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg (BH) false discovery rate (FDR) procedure enjoys widespread use in multiple testing scenarios when the cost of false positives is low and the number of simultaneous tests prohibits use of the Bonferroni procedure. The FDR and the average power are each expected values, of the false discovery proportion (FDP) and true positive proportion (TPP), respectively. Chi (2007), proved a law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for the positive proportion (PP), FDP and TPP, and discusses a criticality phenomenon whereby a minimal FDR corresponding to the effect size is required for a nonzero rate of positive calls. While almost sure convergence follows as a corollary, no direct simple proof exists in the literature. We provide this result under the same set of conditions. Of greater consequence, we prove central limit results (CLT) for the PP, FPF and TPP under these weak conditions, providing full characterization of the limits.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Grant Izmirlian"", ids = ""3870887"")",,,Statistics & Probability Letters,160,108713
f169c1a4464cf112eff2df2ca7359d8e217204f5,Investigating the protective effect of melatonin on liver injury related to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion.,"BACKGROUND
An animal model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) was used to test the hypothesis that free radicals released with MI/R have hazardous effects on liver through remote organ injury.


MATERIAL/METHODS
Twenty-one rats were divided into three groups: sham-treated, MI/R, and MI/R+melatonin. To produce MI/R, a branch of the left coronary artery was occluded for 30 min followed by two hours of reperfusion. Melatonin or vehicle was given 10 min before ischemia. At the end of the study, liver tissue was obtained for biochemical determination. The false discovery rate (FDR) is explained and was used for multiple comparisons of the groups' means.


RESULTS
Compared with the sham group, MI/R significantly decreased glutathione (GSH) content and increased levels of nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Melatonin administration significantly increased GSH levels and decreased the levels of NO and MDA compared with the MI/R group.


CONCLUSIONS

e933dfc95e606f11ffa9f84a44c73f7c24a97d8d,Global gene expression profiles of Phytophthora ramorum strain pr102 in response to plant host and tissue differentiation,"The release of the draft genome sequence of P. ramorum strain Pr102, enabled the construction of an oligonucleotide microarray of the entire genome of Pr102. The array contains 344,680 features (oligos) that represent the transcriptome of Pr102. P. ramorum RNA was extracted from mycelium and sporangia and used to compare gene expression across tissue types and in the presence of the host (Rhododendron sp.). The purpose of the experiment was to identify genes whose expression was responsive to tissue types and upon exposure to the host plant for further study. Gene expression studies were performed using a Nimblegen microarray. Genes were determined to be differentially expressed between tissue types if they were statistically significant P=0.05 after false discovery rate correction and resulted in a greater than 20-fold change in gene expression selecting only those genes with the greatest response to tissue changes or host influence. In the comparison between mycelia and sporangial tissues, 263 genes demonstrated a greater than 20-fold change in gene expression. Of hose genes, 52 genes were significantly downregulated in sporangia as compared to mycelium and 214 genes were significantly upregulated in sporangia as compared to mycelium. Several of the differentially expressed genes appear to be of the same type as those in a similar study in Phytophthora infestans by Kim and Judelson (Eukaryotic Cell, 2003, 2:1376?1385) and include genes involved in cell wall restructuring, cell division and signaling functions. Not surprisingly, several genes involved in energy production, electron transport chains and growth are reduced in sporangia. Fifty percent of the genes with differential expression have not yet been classified as to function in the current annotation.",2008,Biology,"list(name = ""Caroline M.

df6d4575bae8a6bb4ee783859136a8d4a7ccc71f,Significance testing for variable selection in high-dimension,"Assessing the uncertainty pertaining to the conclusions derived from experimental data is challenging when there is a high number of possible explanations compared to the number of experiments. We propose a new two-stage â€œscreen and cleanâ€ procedure for assessing the uncertainties pertaining to the selection of relevant variables in high-dimensional regression problems. In this two-stage method, screening consists in selecting a subset of candidate variables by a sparsity-inducing penalized regression, while cleaning consists in discarding all variables that do not pass a significance test. This test was originally based on ordinary least squares regression. We propose to improve the procedure by conveying more information from the screening stage to the cleaning stage. Our cleaning stage is based on an adaptively penalized regression whose weights are adjusted in the screening stage. Our procedure is amenable to the computation of p-values, allowing to control the False Discovery Rate. Our experiments show the benefits of our procedure, as we observe a systematic improvement of sensitivity compared to the original procedure.",2015,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jean-Michel BÃ©cu"", ids = ""3259172""); list(name = ""Christophe Ambroise"", ids = ""2952661""); list(name = ""Yves Grandvalet"", ids = ""1802711""); list(name = ""Cyril Dalmasso"", ids = ""4379542"")",,07e3035dbdf48221848c3ff39a114d4afa270433; 31d2918d7ee0c8c8f5fbaa4392b2d8c5945796e9; 078fb305820f2e2479f2c6f517524eea522373de; 772c8c016d60089ba42d94c223527e87a8e7c4ee; 4f86ac6903c26df7b3a03f11da0c715b87fb1f4f; 8125d755ad1fa64b869657d0f102836908af7a09; 8383d71822437fe8cb39eadaddaff90430756e6a; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; b8db0ca28c530dd0d0671af5d1a1c238a5a03fee; ff49e482f6bc7bd7dba4999eb16d02e9741300e9; 84b76e8d8390bab6ccadd9aef9286e92b74dc523; 90947c64553041bb83ce5fd97e7782a75ce77d25; 75637242a1c8c121974d26119bbed46e9442c1cc; ee6e0923c626b93f3ead58fc88c348f3b9651e99; f2f658581880b2d996558910f4f58d9c0fadf632; 7302febdec049235971895db54aef77e7624dc3e; 59eb7ea8cd528ee0cafcc858a90c42dadb10e006; ccdfb9985ce6c83428715bc93dd5eb325a785b74; 123261892642e377cf133a607b3199e60c7d4a41; 109974f8eee235de94ed270a1cc4bb3deff6d78c; 9c2bec7994fe1cb65e8fa8c84ede0b3f5ab36149; c3620866f75cf4d2cd498abc91b598ae1ddd1300; 4f9232f0a319f1b4747da4f022b38eb558a855da; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 717ce0992d640e385ae389f353e82c198b96958b; 500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06,2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB),,1-8
fef872feb9484ff76800de33e2cfdf7770d7c675,"A systematic, unbiased mapping of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell epitopes in Yellow Fever vaccinees","Examining CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses after primary Yellow Fever vaccination in a cohort of 210 volunteers, we have identified and tetramer-validated 92 CD8+ and 50 CD4+ T cell epitopes, many inducing strong and prevalent (i.e. immunodominant) T cell responses. Restricted by 40 and 14 HLA-class I and II allotypes, respectively, these responses have wide population coverage and might be of considerable academic, diagnostic and therapeutic interest. The broad coverage of epitopes and HLA overcame the otherwise confounding effects of HLA diversity and non-HLA background providing the first evidence of T cell immunodomination in humans. Also, double-staining of CD4+ T cells with tetramers representing the same HLA-binding core, albeit with different flanking regions, demonstrated an extensive diversification of the specificities of many CD4+ T cell responses. We suggest that this could reduce the risk of pathogen escape, and that multi-tetramer staining is required to reveal the true magnitude and diversity of CD4+ T cell responses. Our T cell epitope discovery approach uses a combination of 1) overlapping peptides representing the entire Yellow Fever virus proteome to search for peptides containing CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cell epitopes, 2) predictors of peptide-HLA binding to suggest epitopes and their restricting HLA allotypes, 3) generation of peptide-HLA tetramers to identify T cell epitopes, and 4) analysis of ex vivo T cell responses to validate the same. This approach is systematic, exhaustive, and can be done in any individual of any HLA haplotype. It is all-inclusive in the sense that it includes all protein antigens and peptide epitopes, and encompasses both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. It is efficient and, importantly, reduces the false discovery rate. The unbiased nature of the T cell epitope discovery approach presented here should support the refinement of future peptide-HLA class I and II predictors and tetramer technologies, which eventually should cover all HLA class I and II isotypes. We believe that future investigations of emerging pathogens (e.g. SARS-CoV-2) should include population-wide T cell epitope discovery using blood samples from patients, convalescents and/or long-term survivors, who might all hold important information on T cell epitopes and responses.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Anette Stryhn"", ids = ""3483185""); list(name = ""Michael Kongsgaard"", ids = ""50688965""); list(name = ""Michael Rasmussen"", ids = ""144661732""); list(name = ""Mikkel Harndahl"", ids = ""3335270""); list(name = ""Thomas Ã\230sterbye"", ids = ""5509027""); list(name = ""Maria Rosaria Bassi"", ids = ""39882096""); list(name = ""SÃ¸ren Thybo"", ids = ""35947047""); list(name = ""Mette Gabriel"", ids = ""1401366911""); list(name = ""Morten Bagge Hansen"", ids = ""40058540""); list(name = ""Morten Nielsen"", ids = ""143898643""); list(name = ""Jan Pravsgaard Christensen"", ids = ""1882564""); list(name = ""Allan Lind Thomsen"", ids = ""50349992""); list(name = ""Soren Buus"", ids = ""153664736"")",,77191ee21059efb5e683e16847647547e6826db7; 4d75af28156ccda78e1bfe9017970afdc97293e5; 1c8def6cd5d74dda838ee78c76f0e4151b4d3d8a; ded6403e634a9fa620dc071c71149ca5632e217b; 705ea180e07bebf5745a6d60ca609054977693db; 64bdb6990dc831ddfbb258959c5b2444a5b5ef36; 23edbfd4b54b6b6a169ac942cf31cdb20880358f; fd48065c874bd7908f299b32381dd63bb496b356; 900efe2ed2e9794738ce66493fd443d47340de96; 20e34deb30e5b9ffcd9f1a1f1e73ba1e7849150b; c2c6894ac3ab12b22c186c7966fcf07e4dcf23c2; cd3dfacf1ad41cc679535d867fd040ea2a1e0404; 89a97acc806f4185afb8aa06e026936012fb224b; 1fb0324baf70d0e1c7b2740d293eb0c2f8af9aa4; 9051063b6b92beda6c4a54e186eb5fce0de47de0; bcbd0c53d829f4475442eae722ee83ec133fc380; 36706fcee92ad9b92cebc280c72790d3f14904d1; 147d643d875d91013920d411a9c1930b037603cf; a7b212e7c280f5ad23423ab94d8cbd8812c51210; 4415d653c94bb130b2990202cc3cfc09f670d4a1; f26c3569337b72029c3c2d2638a4298f21ae0b3a; c28723c8c7d1a999142c279d88a4caf3a8e78609; 4424fbeb9541a2ae663229e1d6b3fa9adda8d07a; 66cd1b804acbf4a9d93761aa2c84583cf3d1db75; d6c1c6fa2466af8b80d6759a7d8d829e7396bb6c; 4413a257f7987dda28b56bff1a553837a205a9a3; c0e1a0711d48c442002e77956761e5d1d2e7e24b; 64b4b5d771a5f877a4dc8357576f53e8764893b0; 90f386463abfa1c48be61256c6744d81181d550a; 986a691a0b131e0cbdc2eb5c544bafec31c08e16; 8f8fc2d82e45f7f09c4af2aa54a87c8617b1fea1; 5c0fc07eabaef12a19f4c5c67988eda647695110; 172f8a549bdd40dcc887fb3c1a4088554d428d2f; e895424f5c5783cb892ad76e460f6305e2f2ad92; 433d810daa8c2280503d28203e5eece473409b89; 2a7ddc99754090b1cb539420d7dad7091eba5824; f7071b56c686453d89237f6fe8519f2180b8fb47; b909c0d6e38333679db722afa39949690260185d; aa780687050da00e43c34c5024d1f2432632f199; 385cfe77c51894ad0b899bc28f518b9d56ed1e80; f400982c96a47f5e69230f8b4f47b4e8f8c8ce1b; 43b1aafb5670f1bd2e6894c59ad54b2d5fba9e2a; 07fbcdd686400a31ff03adbaa5f311fad9f90b98; cb4b628f2da57c171d88bf29c2e489ab22dba73d; b9a5f197208cd79c6a47eeee2c03e9c622c4c50d; 7d97fe18cc4ad6b3b24bd6b8ec380113ea266da1; f3658ef78122f255eee02e1be7f49a41d7c37b1d; f2d62aba7529792c22a378bf213f4e485810b886; 596f7a8ec8d049a792ac02f74f90b6dd6071878e; 75a870f40c9676c4750ec1d1bd70f574dbce8fd6; 17f2bc4793a977c9c569fd76f887aa42ef9b20f6; 33e4ed9092a21196a48d3a6f225fd1ad4551f063; 25ee7acb7aca5adedf4bcb7e07b61c54f561a116; 5189d6a767de85b228ba0dbd8f4ae8ad0b3578b6; 829cab67df3254dab5e729a5cc5b15002a988040; 26bfd968d6c8e125f0db453a3d60c4a2c7bd52f0; a94c06f1e03c56c79491d78988de2a6cddf2a643; 51a3055d0d2de24db9eb743a0aafad292f8f4cf7; b2e59ef9f189fb221eda307f09abfedcc54ec599; 49954bc2658ad765cc7b93e072b1588e694ac602; 8a1cfd3cb67646a1e69ed94a6282d78d1722a16a; 413d6122b22e9af0b02b7f12107c2135e833c34f; ca99c32e96bb65c91e75d1004840dec20d47f3c6; c4961a717cd6a304f6658ef436582891b5921fd9; 9d61f72556a7cf18a12e919f3d2feb588d298442; f95b141d053e05d0effee989483dc21ceacb0559; 176160c60953ddcac9a543be02698ddb5605a0e6; 3de4ea05ba1480150fa81328e4ef0953d197dce6; 09aaf47a0eeaf0d3ab3dfff7cc6e529842e4b28a; 3a2be18d22a2c2efd7465490fe523261dd7e78ca,bioRxiv,,
91246d3fa8c3e1e903dee8a302fc6059634df1dd,Early Trichinella spiralis and Trichinella nativa infections induce similar gene expression profiles in rat jejunal mucosa.,"Trichinella spiralis causes a significantly higher parasite burden in rat muscle than Trichinella nativa. To assess whether the difference in infectivity is due to the early intestinal response, we analyzed gene expression changes in the rat jejunum during Trichinella infection with a whole-genome microarray. The rats were euthanized on day five of infection, and their jejunal mucosa was sampled for microarray analysis. In addition, intestinal histology and hematology were examined. Against our expectations, the gene expression changes were similar in both T.nativa- and T. spiralis-infected groups. The two groups were hence pooled, and in the combined Trichinella-infected group, 551 genes were overexpressed and 427 underexpressed when compared to controls (false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.001 and fold change at least 2 in either direction). Pathway analysis identified seven pathways significantly associated with Trichinella infection (p < 0.05). The microarray data suggested nonspecific damage and an inflammatory response in the jejunal mucosa. Histological findings, including hyperemia, hemorrhage and a marked infiltration of inflammatory cells, supported the microarray data. Trichinella infection caused complex gene expression changes that indicate a host response to tissue damage in the mucosa of the jejunum, but the changes were not notably dependent on the studied species of Trichinella.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Niina Airas"", ids = ""4603502""); list(name = ""Anu NÃ¤reaho"", ids = ""6317741""); list(name = ""Jere LindÃ©n"", ids = ""36972554""); list(name = ""Erkka Valo"", ids = ""6075278""); list(name = ""Sampsa Hautaniemi"", ids = ""2365319""); list(name = ""Pikka Jokelainen"", ids = ""6186584""); list(name = ""Antti Sukura"", ids = ""49135313"")",,0b0cd6f2f05d481cba43672aeeaf634f9686bf3a; f901de4d209203a285638081fb7043d83ebd7d5a; 2a0e693a310d99099785c6aba2185dc961a9941a; 019bd86e04e2a76382cb2884aec123a5da4a65a0; d83056427d74460d0f5da9b896cf51c52476e89b; 2c07c977f31096d12cfc2676514b3a1fcb2cde22; 0e31ec903daf5bb18bcd32ca3fcbeec21ffaf9cc; 3762ff066b253255db929867391e01a731938af6; bcba44c81fb103357ce096a6a46f2ee8ca96c22b; 39913d504331e492e2d3aba3e49b52f6359e2604; 4ead4d868721e8b38c266415a1f6201cd147a78a; bcb001c6ccf277cac70bfed784b3aa4c2a6a7ec0; c88a93546e8123a21d16cfa606a94fb094586a99; 3d1fe4799ebb3a3b77aabb0f544bfcdd03e41cd5; 72502072373a7d15f68a7675b7e71ff400fe7457; 13d0ad2ab7aaec51f8ed230c7d5b6770700adb27; 94b9f18daffd74602a0e44522fb915a18ed1ebf4; e754689205b1c996f874d44d6e2abf8acb25b1f1; 8494deb196010bb0e0a8e1d280c7761de018c091; 8e0170c9e5d51fefeb8934b2a0ab6bb98d624e58; 29a98118f9d2a333376a8bb60f825e67970a9bd3; 44bc2cd1574307d65a0de98b4c730a96b6bb7b95; 5bdaac3d04811253255b3de15f7c014df8672275; 5ca1d583e53ca84287a8767b7289dbd6fc4f46ed; 5878bd0bcadf414764978a774c9642ee210fb616; 2c1c3ae2eb1200cd1d400ff251c02b0f9fd1f274; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; bb346273fe786f47e9a4d9651b3813a3aa5f61db; b645b5f145b31c1ea501d7a307dc3c0ddd3346f3; d0585e1fbaf24d2987de284f82cb36068bf4fe1c,Experimental parasitology,135 2,"

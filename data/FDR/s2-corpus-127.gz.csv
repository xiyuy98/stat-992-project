ab383099574b690f7739a8ccdeda4119ff102a6c,Distributed Detection in Sensor Networks With Limited Range Multimodal Sensors,"We consider a multiobject detection problem over a sensor network (SNET) with limited range multimodal sensors. The general problem complements the widely considered decentralized detection problem where all sensors observe the same object. We develop a distributed detection approach based on recent development of the false discovery rate (FDR) and the associated Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure, which rank orders scalar test statistics. We first develop scalar test statistics for multidimensional data to handle multimodal sensor observations and establish its optimality in terms of the BH procedure. We then propose a distributed algorithm for an idealized model to detect the sensors that are in the immediate vicinity of an object. We show that the number of binary messages that need to be transmitted (communication cost) is upper bounded by the number of sensors that are in the vicinity of objects and is independent of the total number of sensors in the SNET. This brings forth an important principle for evaluating the performance of an SNET, namely, the need for scalability of communications and performance with respect to the number of objects or events in an SNET irrespective of the network size. We then account for nonideal models by developing robust extensions to our developments under the idealized model. The robustness properties ensure that both the error performance and communication cost degrade gracefully with interference.",2010,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Erhan Baki Ermis"", ids = ""1714936""); list(name = ""Venkatesh Saligrama"", ids = ""1699322"")",28c4cfd474bb459ad832127e6417a4ea1dd70eb3; 024d174dbb8016b47ee6a1313eb2fc9e4cce2e4c; 5da82519ac8ac2fae314c240342f839409edffc7; 40872e97936c09eca2791732620b9dd78ac84486; f09425d962cfda37b53c85108fdbbc4911caa7cc; 6755121f1ba0149e3f040e2ca272aaa39c47d551; 3c7429420509872c8a31b32702b35198b2701dd4; 3cb56f34301fadaac9f003e29cdb971162c63c51; b0e7f21658321a8f6f3e610917cdf2de2f3a9dbf; 573cffbf49069037a2fb73f671809ad2b3f0cafb; f1e2e975010225ad2757d01cdeec5875177766aa; a773b593000de339e5f180cdf02661553b45edd5; 6b9e0eef07d35a22c8755cd1123fd9ab71424170; 16a957bfff55bf73e2f92ffc5c0d302590d11f24; c0c84349192d32a3522c89865d1353d5db4d3e4c; 2142597e698416ae9a2e5eccb56cdac60887115b; e17e8caadef5676f8b272214ec0ecd2314db5b91; b98c4e3a653e6ebceabdfe41ea97d3cf7b5f187e,b2f85a170cdb4ef3636aa60c46feeaba20b6072d; 0fc079cc931c345448c2bc0408183f84569db30e; 6b518a8d952a4f832a28da1bf4bcdafbcc0ccf68; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 6e1f93ec4f97c2b334a556fe71abc2b192d1c021; 304eb8e164bb7f0995cf244ce44b91fc1f20e1ee; 54c0a8f1434fb9e43a3bb41f34de055fa5bcded5; 508811243bde1067c1dbbc72919353ee08a8b3e5; 36b9be6122cefacf7a77d1c147a80176916a5711; 0ff65ac698013cdd9d61326cab49a1d75404e001; 7888c46e293f787eda454f6fcdbf61ea9bdc5fb0; 5c6b83008f449671cff2b1d5e583b8bc74ca9196; e893831c0e65bd3f184297c028a32065f459816c; e569a37e8bc8b4fd21a4cab76c1bcfc94e3d5059; 8c5d70f001890f6559e959b82fe6a7ae69d2058b; 16655857d2e6fbae9002f603ac3083c9af8b0e44; 666010dc3621e1a08fb6830f03a1f7857c7377cc; eea1fa82f9330276bb59ceb3dfcfc861bec4a20c; 3e1651164c5a47890771d9f4193155d1960e53a4; 3077546bbea3b38acf3f6b0b8634e40ec4c3ed7e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e71673d749e3476930961e2c9adf181ec6408adc; 4d1f0f026639aa717fdb86572cbac9e4bad2ce20; fb4a1c2b20bfa81bb4b186f38f6adf8af97eb8f0; 8bc7edac220cc813cb43d7fd45b54d0e53bbad42; cb5790ceacac7c3f3b55794ba52cd2248b72d4b9,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,58,843-858
5421fc5f6c1bd8973a8cfa153ba68be7552b0461,A method to identify differential expression profiles of time-course gene data with Fourier transformation,"BackgroundTime course gene expression experiments are an increasingly popular method for exploring biological processes. Temporal gene expression profiles provide an important characterization of gene function, as biological systems are both developmental and dynamic. With such data it is possible to study gene expression changes over time and thereby to detect differential genes. Much of the early work on analyzing time series expression data relied on methods developed originally for static data and thus there is a need for improved methodology. Since time series expression is a temporal process, its unique features such as autocorrelation between successive points should be incorporated into the analysis.ResultsThis work aims to identify genes that show different gene expression profiles across time. We propose a statistical procedure to discover gene groups with similar profiles using a nonparametric representation that accounts for the autocorrelation in the data. In particular, we first represent each profile in terms of a Fourier basis, and then we screen out genes that are not differentially expressed based on the Fourier coefficients. Finally, we cluster the remaining gene profiles using a model-based approach in the Fourier domain. We evaluate the screening results in terms of sensitivity, specificity, FDR and FNR, compare with the Gaussian process regression screening in a simulation study and illustrate the results by application to yeast cell-cycle microarray expression data with alpha-factor synchronization.The key elements of the proposed methodology: (i) representation of gene profiles in the Fourier domain; (ii) automatic screening of genes based on the Fourier coefficients and taking into account autocorrelation in the data, while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR); (iii) model-based clustering of the remaining gene profiles.ConclusionsUsing this method, we identified a set of cell-cycle-regulated time-course yeast genes. The proposed method is general and can be potentially used to identify genes which have the same patterns or biological processes, and help facing the present and forthcoming challenges of data analysis in functional genomics.",2013,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jaehee Kim"", ids = ""49476443""); list(name = ""Robert Todd Ogden"", ids = ""144857992""); list(name = ""Haseong Kim"", ids = ""2392377"")",a29bafcb91e20472c42bac403a04e19147209cc4; 4ce62525cc081ae9a868c375762f376fe004c54e; 778be1719634acb8cf100511bfa064793be53d37; 48a438d9ac073f6f1740a5a9993676645b681658; 66866dd501f0becf2b5027b0b329e3ab2d1c2abd; 148d84747771a110f6b481d391fe00fddec4eef9; c8b2e13b316c0da477eae3a07618a7adccc66ef7; 6acfd0df40cb411cd981c0e4af3cebbc482f8fb6; 8d1cad5cf7e6c471b18acbbbe9bc093a7f65486b; a6615778b628a548748770c11bb827a688e9d903; 7587122ea7ec4d5b0469db712dbd0fac6018b232,64f9db44f17b71e62ebe0bf11bf1447eefe30cfa; daad3119e880b3e4e73bdfe7565c974ea716678a; 0d2db2b24c21db34afd51813e4ecd6add4cc3b6b; 84b7594dd606fe36f630ee0fdbadf5d8f7ac7c2e; 40902c80298752cfba32714f8dd29966ba016016; 637213c836ef7b06ccc57602fff1fb7f5b80b1d3; 9c8a81e1e9ad0926170c09f63c13c11752dffa2c; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; 426b56826c0f72efaddcceed2b521b94dcc4bfe3; a103688e2e6af42432f2ecc5de7ec4840305e128; f5f9746576929e187ecfbeddc2fe45968440cb6a; 71ec2c3f28e5833fbf2b29967982969ac4ddc24e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e25cbfc1abcdce6fd449e42cb3a7db613c398c67; 9c07c51fffda2a237fd9f7c4c0b2bb3f63f9b255; 0ad9f3c2baf70d1fdfdfa4688b46a0c660888dbe; a1a6a7a6cf0d6f40a34b331d3b2cc61ff873501c; 9b44b9b5c90e738e3298c393b82534383d31a49f; 387290646fe1f663c39ad7e545043542e10d97f3; 02af47268750a0b9ff987b383dc79fc4cece0557; 956d43b30629e6be5e8f2c4edb4cea2404598eff; 8e37afc05421154764814d939c5bc8afa16b0064; 9b7cc6b3f0f4318b2d71f7fd6f965702ca2c48fe; bf4c8bc8ddba4521eb0955707af4f28b5535658e; c8eea0f8ee3b81be2d3c539f1d76b630f51ac9c7; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 0c7ea9300a7588038e3d800ce2381251fca20876; a18ed951d0425bedea5ea61c3b5bceda1dd0dceb; 1b9964f8ff7e1973acf79c1a20d64957cc0a25b8; f2f85ec20bcae8d67035fd446b855a75b9a0aa8d; ed7e13c3319eb5740ebab5234b8ec949dfd67080; 66f28308eaac28c1f71ee9780441149e461ccf93; f16841e022038e94a59f7e0a82002102b78d79a4; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 9393721879cae0d9becd88aa9392800ec71dd005; 1a97f46a6d7ef5d261f10c3b07c811789ef47951,BMC Bioinformatics,14,310 - 310

To evaluate the repeatability of MRI and CT derived texture features and to investigate the feasibility of use in predictive single and multi-modality models for radiotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer. Methods: Fifty-nine texture features were extracted from unfiltered and wavelet filtered images. Repeatability of test-retest features from helical 4D CT scans, true fast MRI with steady state precession (TRUFISP), and volumetric interpolation breath-hold examination (VIBE) was determined by the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). A workflow was developed to predict overall survival at 12, 18, and 24 months and tumour response at end of treatment for tumour features, and normal muscle tissue features as a control. Texture features were reduced to repeatable and stable features before clustering. Cluster representative feature selection was performed by univariate or medoid analysis before model selection. P-values were corrected for false discovery rate. Results: Repeatable (CCC â‰¥ 0.9) features were found for both tumour and normal muscle tissue: CT: 54.4% for tumour and 78.5% for normal tissue, TRUFISP: 64.4% for tumour and 67.8% for normal tissue, and VIBE: 52.6% for tumour and 72.9% for normal muscle tissue. Muscle tissue control analysis found 7 significant models with 6 of 7 models utilizing the univariate representative feature selection technique. Tumour analysis revealed 12 significant models for overall survival and none for tumour response at end of treatment. The accuracy of significant single modality was about the same for MR and CT. Multi-modality tumour models had comparable performance to single modality models. Conclusion: MR derived texture features may add value to predictive models and should be investigated in a larger cohort. Control analysis demonstrated that the medoid representative feature selection method may result in more robust models. .",2019,Physics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rebecca Nichole Mahon"", ids = ""50390435""); list(name = ""Geoffrey D.

Understanding the pathogenesis in the early stages of late-onset AD can help gain important mechanistic insights into this disease as well as aid in effective drug development. The analysis of incipient AD is steeped in difficulties due to its slight pathological and genetic differences from normal ageing. The difficulty also lies in the choice of analysis techniques as statistical power to analyse incipient AD with a small sample size, as is common in pilot studies, can be low if the proper analytical tool is not employed. In this study, we propose the use of a new method of significant genes selection, multiple linear regression, which uses the cognitive index (MiniMental Status Examination (MMSE)) and pathological characteristic (neurofibrillary tangles (NFT)), along with gene expression profiles, to select genes. The data consists of 7 incipient AD affected subjects and 9 age-matched normal controls. The analysis resulted in 686 significant genes with a false discovery rate of 0.2. Among the various biological processes previously known to be associated with AD, we discovered a set of 14 DNA repair genes that had statistically elevated or lowered levels of mRNA expression. Many key players involved in the defense against DNA damage were present in this list of 14 genes. In this article we report the status of DNA repair activity in incipient AD. From this study we conclude that the much observed apoptosis in AD may also be due to the activity of DNA repair genes. These findings have not been previously reported with respect to incipient AD and may shed new light onto its pathogenesis. This is the first study that has incorporated multiple clinical phenotypes of AD affected individuals in order to select statistically significant genes. It is also the first in analysing DNA repair genes in the context of AD via microarray gene expres-",2016,,,,b1bf935b0bea8fc194570732d08ed2fb5cf7517b; a1ab52ec816982a5a69665db6780b3b5d8ceb216; 5bb54a72327bc53ace0033cb47a28ba9cda01a66,,,
533018567b9d84eecc8467fc0a556436f245eb91,Association of Common PALB 2 Polymorphismswith Breast Cancer Risk : ACase-Control Study,"Purpose:The PALB2 gene has an essential role in BRCA2-mediated DNA double-strand break repair and intra ^ S phase DNA damage checkpoint control, and its mutations are moderately associated with breast cancer susceptibility.This study was designed to investigate the common variants of PALB2 and their association with breast cancer risk. Experimental Design: Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; rs249954, rs249935, rs120963, and rs16940342) which tagged all 19 of the reported SNPs (minor allele frequency >0.05) covering PALB2 were selected and genotyped in 1,049 patients with breast cancer and 1,073 cancer-free controls in a female Chinese population. Results: Based on the multiple hypothesis testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method, tagging SNPs (tSNP) rs249954, rs120963, and rs16940342 were found to be associated with an increase of breast cancer risk (false discovery rate ^ adjusted P values of 0.004, 0.028, and 0.049, respectively) under the dominant model. tSNP rs249954 was associated with a 36% increase of breast cancer risk [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.36; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.13-1.64; P = 0.001; TT/TC versus CC genotypes]. The adjusted OR for rs120963 was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.04-1.49; P = 0.014; CC/CT versusTTgenotypes). For rs16940342, the adjusted OR was1.21 (95% CI,1.02-1.45; P = 0.037; GG/GAversus AA genotypes). Based on an additive model, tSNPs rs249954 and rs120963 were associated with an increase of breast cancer risk (P = 0.005 and 0.019; respectively), with the false discovery rate ^ adjusted P values being 0.020 and 0.038, respectively. Conclusions:Our data suggest that the variants of PALB2 confer low-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility in a Chinese population. Breast cancer is the most common cancer of women, with an estimated 178,000 new cases and 40,000 deaths in the United States in 2007 (1). Although the incidence of breast cancer in China is one-fifth of that in the United States, there has been a recent increase in the incidence of this disease (2, 3). The incidence of breast cancer is about twice as common in women with first-degree relatives affected by the disease compared with the general population, and the risk ratio increases with increasing numbers of affected first-degree relatives. This indicates that hereditary factors are involved in the development of breast cancer (4). In the 1990s, mutations of BRCA1, BRCA2 , and TP53, which confer a high risk (5to 10-fold) of breast cancer, were identified (5â€“7). However, these mutations account for less than 5% of all patients with breast cancer, and less than 25% of those with familial cancers (8). Moderatepenetrance mutations of CHEK2, BRIP1 , and ATM, which are rare but interact with BRCA1 and/or TP53, confer a 2-fold risk of breast cancer, have also been identified (9â€“11). Breast cancer susceptibility is thought to be associated with a â€˜â€˜polygenicâ€™â€™ model, in which a number of loci contribute to susceptibility, with each locus contributing only a small effect (12). Obviously, common variants of the abovementioned six genes are good candidates for breast cancer susceptibility. Their associations with breast cancer have been evaluated by a number of research groups, but studies have found conflicting results or no significant association (13â€“20). To date, several genomewide association studies have been accomplished in which several novel susceptibility loci have been identified (21â€“24).

Biallelic BRCA2 mutations cause the D1 subtype of FA, and the phenotype of this subtype is different from other types, with a high risk of childhood solid tumors (26). Two research groups recently identified a new subtype of FA, FA-N, which has a similar phenotype as FA-D1 but lacks BRCA2 mutations (26, 27). PALB2 (partner and localizer of BRCA2), a nuclear partner of BRCA2, is required for the intranuclear localization and stability of BRCA2 to execute its functions in error-free DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination and checkpoint control in intraâ€“S phase DNA damage processes (28). Reduction of the expression of PALB2 by small interfering RNA, similar to a BRCA2 small interfering RNA, sensitized HeLa cells to mitomycin C, and resulted in a phenotype typical of FA (28). Because the defects in PALB2 were related to this new FA subtype, and affected subjects had a tendency to develop childhood cancer, PALB2 is also known as FANCN (FA complementation group N). In a subsequent study in the United Kingdom, monoallelic truncating mutations of PALB2 were found to be associated with a 2.3-fold increased risk of breast cancer in individuals with familial breast cancer (29). In Finland, a new PALB2 mutation, found in patients with or without a family history of breast cancer, conferred a 4-fold increased risk (30). Other studies have also found that truncating mutations in PALB2 conferred a moderate risk (31, 32). These data indicate that PALB2 mutations are moderatepenetrance susceptibility factors for breast cancer. Still, these mutations are rare, they occur in less than 1% of unselected breast cancers, and in less than 3% of patients with familial breast cancers (29â€“32). Considering the fact that PALB2 is important for FA and DNA double-strand break repair, common variants of PALB2 are candidates for genetic susceptibility to breast cancer. However, no previous study has investigated common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of PALB2 for association with breast cancer susceptibility. In the present study, we analyzed common SNPs of PALB2 and their associations with breast cancer risk in a case-control study using a SNPtagging method. Translational Relevance Although many genetic and environmental factors have been suggested to be involved in the etiology of breast cancer, the underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms are not fully understood. The present investigation is a continuation of our efforts to determine the genetic risk factors involved in the development of human breast cancer. In this study, we identified several common PALB2 polymorphisms that confer low-penetrance susceptibility to breast cancer. Our findings support the concept that genetic variants of the PALB2 gene confer breast cancer susceptibility and that this gene can be a potential target for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. This discovery also offers an opportunity to use PALB2 as a biomarker in disease prediction and diagnosis of breast cancer. In addition, PALB2 variants, as personal genetic/ genomic profiling factors, can be used to predict cancer predisposition, leading to personalized approaches to cancer prevention and/or clinical management.Thus, these results may be applied to future clinical and basic cancer research and practice for improvements in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of breast cancer.

341a409d6bedaa577e846478e2d93f123657f05f,Multiplex and Label-Free Relative Quantification Approach for Studying Protein Abundance of Drug Metabolizing Enzymes in Human Liver Microsomes Using SWATH-MS.,"We describe a sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectra (SWATH-MS) based method for label-free, simultaneous, relative quantification of drug metabolism enzymes in human liver microsomes (HLM; n = 78). In-solution tryptic digestion was aided by a pressure cycling method, which allowed a 90 min incubation time, a significant reduction over classical protocols (12-18 h). Digested peptides were separated on an Acquity UHPLC Peptide BEH C18 column using a 60 min gradient method at a flow rate of 0.100 mL/min. The quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ESI-QTOFMS) was operated in positive electrospray ionization mode, and data were acquired by data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and SWATH-MSALL mode. A pooled HLM sample was used as a quality control to evaluate variability in digestion and quantification among different batches, and inter-batch %CV for various proteins was between 3.1 and 7.8%. Spectral library generated from the DDA data identified 1855 distinct proteins and 25â€¯681 distinct peptides at a 1% global false discovery rate (FDR). SWATH data were queried and analyzed for 10 major cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes using Skyline, a targeted data extraction software. Further, correlation analysis was performed between functional activity, protein, and mRNA expression for ten CYP enzymes. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between protein and activity for CYPs ranged from 0.314 (CYP2C19) to 0.767 (CYP2A6). A strong correlation was found between CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 abundance and activity determined using midazolam and testosterone (r > 0.600, p < 0.001). Protein-to-activity correlation was moderate (r > 0.400-0.600, p < 0.001) for CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2E1 and significant but poor (r < 0.400, p < 0.05) for CYP2C8, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. The findings suggest the suitability of SWATH-MS based method as a valuable and relatively fast analytical technique for relative quantification of proteins in complex biological samples. We also show that protein abundance is a better surrogate than mRNA to predict the activity of CYP activity.",2017,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Rohitash Jamwal"", ids = ""46829877""); list(name = ""Benjamin J.

ecdf40c7af78844d986f3692deed79cefdd4a1bb,Weighted Meta-Analysis for Small Sample Microarray Studies,"An abundance of data from microarray studies are available in publicly-accessible databases. Most of these studies are conducted by university based research labs. It is not uncommon for such studies to run only three or four replicates for each experimental condition tested. With this low sample size and the high variability and multiple testing problems inherent to microarray technology, it is difficult to draw statistically significant conclusions from any one such study. Meta-analysis could improve this situation by combining evidence from related studies to increase statistical power. In this work we discussed several meta-analysis methods for small sample gene expression studies. We compared the performances of the traditional Fisherâ€™s log-sum and Stoufferâ€™sZ meta-analysis methods, as well as three weighted variants of Stoufferâ€™s method. Higher false discovery rates were observed for the traditional methods compared to the weighted methods.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Dallas Joder"", ids = ""87774254""); list(name = ""Nusrat Jahan"", ids = ""145326416"")",,4bec12cbe4108817f18d7802af336d964b12558b; 8f31f1026b8e752b131f376e4b68d44775edddc0; 58cd525db8e3eba143dc0b1a71df86d3cea66fc2; fede2201777d6994d4c393936ae4779b57621185; a82bd848c17e720af211bfe3f353c500dcbfa16e; 46bf32620692f32f7ba9a307d2c1b6d7d2022269; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 3e594872839912ebe0de050b2d474406d52910c1; 22fd79170937faca1f0cc7f3ececf02d59e5aa3e; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; f1826eeffa3912bf86c0c0544c88bc320ff5f5d0; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; 0eaa28aa3612057f8af7c93c59e03f26e3f67ca8; 9c0cbf5c274100e29d0c4fee9d99387f450e129a; 404fa83c25731b22bf28c93265188b6ce3730a81; 16dd32d6459b19bc14dec1864d9dd7c12abe37a3; a5e82ee0621f35bc3c1123dfbba32bad9932ef4d; 08f0b646d4798e873b6fd92aab6a9d94dd15313c; 77fc8a9ab262e10fb4b5c8ddd457bc2aceb8c4c4; faa504151237a2f342612f7dc8c4989fd7b5ce39,Journal of Animal Science,2,
ba5afe49bff061c42b9d845559c014de616486d6,Detection and comparison of microRNA expression in the serum of Doberman Pinschers with dilated cardiomyopathy and healthy controls,"BackgroundDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common heart disease in Doberman Pinschers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs playing important roles in gene regulation. Different miRNA expression patterns have been described for DCM in humans and might represent potential diagnostic markers. There are no studies investigating miRNA expression profiles in canine DCM. The aims of this study were to screen the miRNA expression profile of canine serum using miRNA microarray and to compare expression patterns of a group of Doberman Pinschers with DCM and healthy controls.ResultsEight Doberman Pinschers were examined by echocardiography and 24-hour-ECG and classified as healthy (n = 4) or suffering from DCM (n = 4). Total RNA was extracted from serum and hybridized on a custom-designed 8x60k miRNA microarray (Agilent) containing probes for 1368 individual miRNAs. Although total RNA concentrations were very low in serum samples, 404 different miRNAs were detectable with sufficient signal intensity on miRNA microarray. 22 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the two groups (p < 0.05 and fold change (FC) > 1.5), but did not reach statistical significance after multiple testing correction (false discovery rate adjusted p > 0.05). Five miRNAs were selected for further analysis using quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR (qPCR) assays. No significant differences were found using specific miRNA qPCR assays (p > 0.05).ConclusionsNumerous miRNAs can be detected in canine serum. Between healthy and DCM dogs, miRNA expression changes could be detected, but the results did not reach statistical significance most probably due to the small group size. miRNAs are potential new circulating biomarkers in veterinary medicine and should be investigated in larger patient groups and additional canine diseases.",2013,Biology;

18f677e5ee3f15a5531f45052a2bc78c15a800a4,Robust estimation of the false discovery rate,"MOTIVATION
Presently available methods that use p-values to estimate or control the false discovery rate (FDR) implicitly assume that p-values are continuously distributed and based on two-sided tests. Therefore, it is difficult to reliably estimate the FDR when p-values are discrete or based on one-sided tests.


RESULTS
A simple and robust method to estimate the FDR is proposed. The proposed method does not rely on implicit assumptions that tests are two-sided or yield continuously distributed p-values. The proposed method is proven to be conservative and have desirable large-sample properties. In addition, the proposed method was among the best performers across a series of 'real data simulations' comparing the performance of five currently available methods.

4f84d52f6272acbcd0f4d9433c03e3e498818276,Transformation Invariant Control of Voxel-Wise False Discovery Rate,"Multiple testing for statistical maps remains a critical and challenging problem in brain mapping. Since the false discovery rate (FDR) criterion was introduced to the neuroimaging community a decade ago, many variations have been proposed, mainly to enhance detection power. However, a fundamental geometrical property known as transformation invariance has not been adequately addressed, especially for the voxel-wise FDR. Correction of multiple testing applied after spatial transformation is not necessarily equivalent to transformation applied after correction in the original space. Without the invariance property, assigning different testing spaces will yield different results. We find that normalized residuals of linear models with Gaussian noises are uniformly distributed on a unit high-dimensional sphere, independent of t-statistics and F-statistics. By defining volumetric measure in the hyperspherical space mapped by normalized residuals, instead of the image's Euclidean space, we can achieve invariant control of the FDR under diffeomorphic transformation. This hyperspherical measure also reflects intrinsic ""volume of randomness"" in signals.

2a24adc4389ffa798e9c3502568d1d98aff450ad,Linkage and association of myocilin (MYOC) polymorphisms with high myopia in a Chinese population,"PURPOSE
To test the association between myocilin gene (MYOC) polymorphisms and high myopia in Hong Kong Chinese by using family-based association study.


METHODS
A total of 162 Chinese nuclear families, consisting of 557 members, were recruited from an optometry clinic. Each family had two parents and at least one offspring with high myopia (defined as -6.00D or less for both eyes). All offspring were healthy with no clinical evidence of syndromic disease and other ocular abnormality. Genotyping was performed for two MYOC microsatellites (NGA17 and NGA19) and five tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spreading across the gene. The genotype data were analyzed with Family-Based Association Test (FBAT) software to check linkage and association between the genetic markers and myopia, and with GenAssoc to generate case and pseudocontrol subjects for investigating main effects of genetic markers and calculating the genotype relative risks (GRR).


RESULTS
FBAT analysis showed linkage and association with high myopia for two microsatellites and two SNPs under one to three genetic models after correction for multiple comparisons by false discovery rate. NGA17 at the promoter was significant under an additive model (p=0.0084), while NGA19 at the 3' flanking region showed significant results under both additive (p=0.0172) and dominant (p=0.0053) models. SNP rs2421853 (C>T) exhibited both linkage and association under additive (p=0.0009) and dominant/recessive (p=0.0041) models. SNP rs235858 (T>C) was also significant under additive (p=4.0E-6) and dominant/recessive (p=2.5E-5) models. Both SNPs were downstream of NGA19 at the 3' flanking region. Positive results for these SNPs were novel findings. A stepwise conditional logistic regression analysis of the case-pseudocontrol dataset generated by GenAssoc from the families showed that both SNPs could separately account for the association of NGA17 or NGA19, and that both SNPs contributed separate main effects to high myopia. For rs2421853 and with C/C as the reference genotype, the GRR increased from 1.678 for G/A to 2.738 for A/A (p=9.0E-4, global Wald test). For rs235858 and with G/G as the reference, the GRR increased 2.083 for G/A to 3.931 for A/A (p=2.0E-2, global Wald test). GRR estimates thus suggested an additive model for both SNPs, which was consistent with the finding that, of the three models tested, the additive model gave the lowest p values in FBAT analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
Linkage and association was shown between the MYOC polymorphisms and high myopia in our family-based association study.

4465032f9097ebc64fc31fc60cecdfc7dd35b803,In vivo tissue sampling using solid-phase microextraction for non-lethal exposome-wide association study of CYP1A1 induction in Catostomus commersonii.,"Fish are widely used for monitoring aquatic ecosystem health and water contamination by organic toxicants from natural and anthropogenic sources. However, most of these studies only focused on the measurement of specific toxicants and did not examine the impact of chemical mixtures. In this study, we examined whether the tissue exposome captured in vivo with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) without lethal sampling and analyzed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry can detect differences between Catostomus commersonii exhibiting a significant induction of CYP1A1, through case/control comparisons, controlling for false discovery rates. We observed the presence of environmental toxicants in induced case fish known as potential inducers of CYP1A1. We also found significant changes in the levels of anti-oxidants, short-lived oxysterols and other lipids associated with CYP1A1 induction, possibly due to oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and free fatty acids mobilization to maintain homeostatic state. In vivo SPME opens the way to perform repeated sampling on the same animal over the time and explore the individual internal exposome trajectory for better characterization of the links between toxicant load and health effects, at the individual scale.",2016,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bessonneau Vincent"", ids = ""26833648""); list(name = ""I.

cb5790ceacac7c3f3b55794ba52cd2248b72d4b9,Adaptive statistical sampling methods for decentralized estimation and detection of localized phenomena,"Sensor networks (SNETs) for monitoring spatial phenomena has emerged as an area of significant practical interest. We focus on the important problem of detection of distributed events, sources, or abnormalities that are localized, i.e., only a small number of sensors in the vicinity of the phenomena are in the field of observation. This problem complements the standard decentralized detection problem, where noisy information about an event is measured by the entire network. For localized phenomena the main difficulty arises from the coupling of: a) noisy sensor observations that lead to local false positives/negatives; and b) limited energy, which constrains communication among sensor nodes. Together these difficulties call for reaching a decentralized statistical ordering based on limited collaboration. We are then led to the following fundamental problem: determine the most probable event locations while minimizing communication cost. Our objective in this paper is to characterize the fundamental trade offs between global performance (false alarms and miss rate) and communication cost. We develop a framework to minimize the communication cost subject to worst-case misclassification constraints by making use of the false discovery rate (FDR) concept along with an optimal local measure transformation at each sensor node. The preliminary results show that the FDR concept applied in a sensor networks context leads to significant reduction in the communication cost of the system. A very interesting implication of this work is that the detection performance of a wireless sensor network is comparable to that of a wired network of sensors.",2005,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Erhan Baki Ermis"", ids = ""1714936""); list(name = ""Venkatesh Saligrama"", ids = ""1699322"")",ab383099574b690f7739a8ccdeda4119ff102a6c; b98c4e3a653e6ebceabdfe41ea97d3cf7b5f187e,846ccc8288589bcc398f48fe3ddbd91e7defb388; dc80487c9184728d9146ef1c4dd691a8f2d3e618; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 51039228ffb918fd8f509babb52818286f92d7f6; 16655857d2e6fbae9002f603ac3083c9af8b0e44; bed8aa6c3ad8dff41a825e1f66984291ad66477c; c610be12d315eaae14922cfee78e24726f4db569; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; 806be313fb9d8e1de381c563864918ed11720a58; eb215dbd0d1456898a83247c5f62413b6563f8c3,"IPSN 2005.

bfdb129552d17e728de5d7443b977d8b89fccdf9,The Analysis of microRNA Expression Profiling for Coronary Artery Disease,"Objectives: To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of coronary artery disease (CAD) using microarray expression profiles. Methods: The microRNA (miRNA) expression-profiling dataset GSE28858 was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, including 24 samples from 12 patients with CAD and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified with false discovery rate (FDR) = 1% by the SAM (Significant Analysis of Microarray) algorithm. The target genes of selected differentials expressed miRNAs that were not only related to CAD, but were also in two databases (TargetScan, miRanda). Then, the interactive objects of selected target genes were predicted using the STRING database to construct an interaction network (confidence score = 0.4). These target genes and interactive objects were put into the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database, and the significant signaling pathway was obtained by hypergeometric function enrichment analysis (p < 0.05). Results: MiRNA-526b was the only differentially expressed miRNA that was upregulated in patients with CAD (FDR = 1%). Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was the target gene of miRNA-526b that occurred with the highest frequency. The objects that interacted with TLR4 were predicted using the STRING database and the interaction network was obtained. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway was the only selected significant pathway related with CAD in the interaction network (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The miRNA-526b is significantly upregulated in patients with CAD and the target gene of miRNA-526b participates in the VEGF signaling pathway.

We thus evaluated differential gene expression in thyroid tissue in relation to iodine-131 (I-131) doses received from the Chernobyl accident. Sixty three of 104 papillary thyroid cancers diagnosed between 1998 and 2008 in the Ukrainian-American cohort with individual I-131 thyroid dose estimates had paired RNA specimens from fresh frozen tumor (T) and normal (N) tissue provided by the Chernobyl Tissue Bank and satisfied quality control criteria. We first hybridized 32 randomly allocated RNA specimen pairs (T/N) on 64 whole genome microarrays (Agilent, 4Ã—44 K). Associations of differential gene expression (log(2)(T/N)) with dose were assessed using Kruskall-Wallis and trend tests in linear mixed regression models. While none of the genes withstood correction for the false discovery rate, we selected 75 genes with a priori evidence or P kruskall/P trend <0.0005 for validation by qRT-PCR on the remaining 31 RNA specimen pairs (T/N). The qRT-PCR data were analyzed using linear mixed regression models that included radiation dose as a categorical or ordinal variable. Eleven of 75 qRT-PCR assayed genes (ACVR2A, AJAP1, CA12, CDK12, FAM38A, GALNT7, LMO3, MTA1, SLC19A1, SLC43A3, ZNF493) were confirmed to have a statistically significant differential dose-expression relationship. Our study is among the first to provide direct human data on long term differential gene expression in relation to individual I-131 doses and to identify a set of genes potentially important in radiation carcinogenesis.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael Abend"", ids = ""35521770""); list(name = ""Ruth M.

7a7bcb33de14d553168bda75e05acb9a28760643,FDRAnalysis: a tool for the integrated analysis of tandem mass spectrometry identification results from multiple search engines.,"Confident identification of peptides via tandem mass spectrometry underpins modern high-throughput proteomics. This has motivated considerable recent interest in the postprocessing of search engine results to increase confidence and calculate robust statistical measures, for example through the use of decoy databases to calculate false discovery rates (FDR). FDR-based analyses allow for multiple testing and can assign a single confidence value for both sets and individual peptide spectrum matches (PSMs). We recently developed an algorithm for combining the results from multiple search engines, integrating FDRs for sets of PSMs made by different search engine combinations. Here we describe a web-server and a downloadable application that makes this routinely available to the proteomics community. The web server offers a range of outputs including informative graphics to assess the confidence of the PSMs and any potential biases. The underlying pipeline also provides a basic protein inference step, integrating PSMs into protein ambiguity groups where peptides can be matched to more than one protein. Importantly, we have also implemented full support for the mzIdentML data standard, recently released by the Proteomics Standards Initiative, providing users with the ability to convert native formats to mzIdentML files, which are available to download.",2011,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""David C.

64de1821456fd3cae6058121ac31fb9079f45138,Surface-based TBM boosts power to detect disease effects on the brain: An N=804 ADNI study,"Computational anatomy methods are now widely used in clinical neuroimaging to map the profile of disease effects on the brain and its clinical correlates. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), many research groups have modeled localized changes in hippocampal and lateral ventricular surfaces, to provide candidate biomarkers of disease progression for drug trials. We combined the power of parametric surface modeling and tensor-based morphometry to study hippocampal differences associated with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in 490 subjects (97 AD, 245 MCI, 148 controls) and ventricular differences in 804 subjects scanned as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; 184 AD, 391 MCI, 229 controls). We aimed to show that a new multivariate surface statistic based on multivariate tensor-based morphometry (mTBM) and radial distance provides a more powerful way to detect localized anatomical differences than conventional surface-based analysis. In our experiments, we studied correlations between hippocampal atrophy and ventricular enlargement and clinical measures and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. The new multivariate statistics gave better effect sizes for detecting morphometric differences, relative to other statistics including radial distance, analysis of the surface tensor and the Jacobian determinant. In empirical tests using false discovery rate curves, smaller sample sizes were needed to detect associations with diagnosis. The analysis pipeline is generic and automated. It may be applied to analyze other brain subcortical structures including the caudate nucleus and putamen.

daa0ac024bd84ba2572003d382a8d3afff56cabf,Profile of Circulatory Metabolites in a Relapsing-remitting Animal Model of Multiple Sclerosis using Global Metabolomics.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the CNS. Although, MS is well characterized in terms of the role played by immune cells, cytokines and CNS pathology, nothing is known about the metabolic alterations that occur during the disease process in circulation. Recently, metabolic aberrations have been defined in various disease processes either as contributing to the disease, as potential biomarkers, or as therapeutic targets. Thus in an attempt to define the metabolic alterations that may be associated with MS disease progression, we profiled the plasma metabolites at the chronic phase of disease utilizing relapsing remitting-experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (RR-EAE) model in SJL mice. At the chronic phase of the disease (day 45), untargeted global metabolomic profiling of plasma collected from EAE diseased SJL and healthy mice was performed, using a combination of high-throughput liquid-and-gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. A total of 282 metabolites were identified, with significant changes observed in 44 metabolites (32 up-regulated and 12 down-regulated), that mapped to lipid, amino acid, nucleotide and xenobiotic metabolism and distinguished EAE from healthy group (p<0.05, false discovery rate (FDR)<0.23). Mapping the differential metabolite signature to their respective biochemical pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomics (KEGG) database, we found six major pathways that were significantly altered (containing concerted alterations) or impacted (containing alteration in key junctions). These included bile acid biosynthesis, taurine metabolism, tryptophan and histidine metabolism, linoleic acid and D-arginine metabolism pathways. Overall, this study identified a 44 metabolite signature drawn from various metabolic pathways which correlated well with severity of the EAE disease, suggesting that these metabolic changes could be exploited as (1) biomarkers for EAE/MS progression and (2) to design new treatment paradigms where metabolic interventions could be combined with present and experimental therapeutics to achieve better treatment of MS.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""A.

Appropriate multiplicity adjustment is crucial to guarantee replicability of findings, and False Discovery Rate (FDR) is frequently adopted as a measure of global error. In the interest of interpretability, results are often summarized so that reporting focuses on variants discovered to be associated to some phenotypes. We show that applying FDR-controlling procedures on the entire collection of hypotheses fails to control the rate of false discovery of associated variants as well as the average rate of false discovery of phenotypes influenced by such variants. We propose a simple hierarchical testing procedure which allows control of both these error rates and provides a more reliable basis for the identification of variants with functional effects. We demonstrate the utility of this approach through simulation studies comparing various error rates and measures of power for multiple traits genetic association studies. Finally, we apply the proposed method to identify genetic variants which impact flowering phenotypes in Arabdopsis thaliana, expanding the set of discoveries.",2015,,"list(name = ""Christine B.

d3168922983d461bab1e92ccea4c3d3d24cc0821,Concordance of genetic variation that increases risk for Tourette Syndrome and that influences its underlying neurocircuitry,"There have been considerable recent advances in understanding the genetic architecture of Tourette Syndrome (TS) as well as its underlying neurocircuitry. However, the mechanisms by which genetic variation that increases risk for TSâ€”and its main symptom dimensionsâ€”influence relevant brain regions are poorly understood. Here we undertook a genome-wide investigation of the overlap between TS genetic risk and genetic influences on the volume of specific subcortical brain structures that have been implicated in TS. We obtained summary statistics for the most recent TS genome-wide association study (GWAS) from the TS Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Working Group (4644 cases and 8695 controls) and GWAS of subcortical volumes from the ENIGMA consortium (30,717 individuals). We also undertook analyses using GWAS summary statistics of key symptom factors in TS, namely social disinhibition and symmetry behaviour. SNP effect concordance analysis (SECA) was used to examine genetic pleiotropyâ€”the same SNP affecting two traitsâ€”and concordanceâ€”the agreement in single nucelotide polymorphism (SNP) effect directions across these two traits. In addition, a conditional false discovery rate (FDR) analysis was performed, conditioning the TS risk variants on each of the seven subcortical and the intracranial brain volume GWAS. Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR) was used as validation of the SECA method. SECA revealed significant pleiotropy between TS and putamen (pâ€‰=â€‰2â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’4) and caudate (pâ€‰=â€‰4â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’4) volumes, independent of direction of effect, and significant concordance between TS and lower thalamic volume (pâ€‰=â€‰1â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’3). LDSR lent additional support for the association between TS and thalamus volume (pâ€‰=â€‰5.85â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’2). Furthermore, SECA revealed significant evidence of concordance between the social disinhibition symptom dimension and lower thalamus volume (pâ€‰=â€‰1â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’3), as well as concordance between symmetry behaviour and greater putamen volume (pâ€‰=â€‰7â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’4). Conditional FDR analysis further revealed novel variants significantly associated with TS (pâ€‰<â€‰8â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’7) when conditioning on intracranial (rs2708146, qâ€‰=â€‰0.046; and rs72853320, qâ€‰=â€‰0.035) and hippocampal (rs1922786, qâ€‰=â€‰0.001) volumes, respectively. These data indicate concordance for genetic variation involved in disorder risk and subcortical brain volumes in TS. Further work with larger samples is needed to fully delineate the genetic architecture of these disorders and their underlying neurocircuitry.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mary Mufford"", ids = ""29829208""); list(name = ""Josh W Cheung"", ids = ""80692147""); list(name = ""Neda Jahanshad"", ids = ""1721831""); list(name = ""Celia van der Merwe"", ids = ""30774828""); list(name = ""Linda Ding"", ids = ""3266255""); list(name = ""Nynke A.

ffb9367a1264bc5a838e71cb12d4139385833b70,Gene regulation and the emergence of phenotypes â€“ a network approach,"Despite being a highly studied model organism, most genes of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 encode proteins with completely unknown function. To facilitate studies of gene regulation in Synechocystis, we have developed Synergy (http://synergy.plantgenie.org), a web application integrating coexpression networks and regulatory motif analysis. Co-expression networks were inferred from publicly available microarray experiments, while regulatory motifs were identified using a phylogenetic footprinting approach. Automatically discovered motifs were shown to be enriched in the network neighborhoods of regulatory proteins much more often than in the neighborhoods of non-regulatory genes, showing that the data provide a sound starting point for studying gene regulation in Synechocystis. Concordantly, we provide several case studies demonstrating that Synergy can be used to find biologically relevant regulatory mechanisms in Synechocystis. Synergy can be used to interactively perform analyses such as gene/motif search, network visualization and motif/function enrichment. Considering the importance of Synechocystis for photosynthesis and biofuel research, we believe that Synergy will become a valuable resource to the research community. Introduction Cyanobacteria are the only prokaryotic organisms that produce oxygen in the process of photosynthesis, and are the ancestors of higher plant chloroplasts.

PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0113496 November 24, 2014 1 / 18 only did cyanobacteria establish the aerobic Earthâ€™s atmosphere, they also play a crucial role in the global biochemical cycle today by fixing CO2 and producing half of the global biomass. Being prokaryotes, cyanobacteria can be genetically modified easily and due to their fast photoautotrophic growth, they have a great potential for large scale production of renewable biofuels [1, 2] and other valuable products [1, 3, 4]. The popularity of the cyanobacteria phylum in photosynthesis and biotechnology research is reflected in the high number of sequenced cyanobacterial genomes available in Cyanobase (http://genome.microbedb.jp/ cyanobase/) [5] and other public databases [6]. After the genome of the unicellular fresh water cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis) was sequenced in 1996 [7], large amounts of gene expression data have been generated from cells exposed to diverse experimental conditions. Identifying groups of genes with similar expression patterns (i.e. co-expressed genes) in such data sets allows inference of functional and regulatory similarities among genes. For example, light response in Synechocystis has been studied using gene co-expression networks [8â€“10]. While these studies give insight into how cells react to single modifications, only the integration of multiple transcriptome data sets will allow a holistic understanding of the cellular response. The first meta-analysis of transcriptomics data in Synechocystis used a co-expression network inferred from 163 different environmental and genetic perturbations to identify a large number of genes (referred to as the Core Transcriptional Response) that are commonly regulated under most perturbations [9]. The growing interest in integrated transcriptome analysis has also led to the development of a web database, CyanoEXpress [11]. Although this tool comprises a vast set of experimental data, and integrates microarray data obtained with different experimental platforms, its use is restricted to the visualization and analysis of gene expression clusters. However, genes regulated by the same transcription factor (i.e. co-regulated genes) should not only be co-expressed, but also contain similar cis-regulatory elements in their promoter region. In Synechocystis, co-expression has not yet been linked with motif discovery in order to obtain a more mechanistic understanding of gene regulation. We have developed Synergy, a web resource for exploring Synechocystis gene regulation, which integrates co-expression network analysis with motif analysis. Synergy is available at http://synergy.plantgenie.org. Considering the importance of Synechocystis as a model organism in biofuel production [2] and photosynthetic research [12, 13], we believe Synergy will become a valuable resource to many researchers. Results and Discussion In this article we provide an integrated analysis of co-expression networks, promoter motifs and existing gene function annotations in Synechocystis. See Figure 1 for an overview. Synergy: Exploring Gene Regulation in Synechocystis PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0113496 November 24, 2014 2 / 18 Co-expression network inference Co-expression networks were inferred from 371 individual microarray experiments obtained from KEGG Expression (Table 1; http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ expression/; [14]). We used locally corrected mutual information scores (CLR scores, see Materials and Methods) to measure co-expression between pairs of genes, and constructed co-expression networks by linking genes with a CLR score above a preset threshold. Thus, a co-expression network is a set of nodes representing genes, which are connected by links representing co-expression above a threshold. Since some of the expression values were missing in the published data, we decided to investigate their impact by inferring two different networks; one based on a subset of samples that contained expression values for all the genes across all microarrays (subset co-expression), and another one based on all microarrays (complete co-expression). The subset co-expression network contained 3,077 genes (i.e. nodes) and 59,595 links with a CLR score above 4.0, while the corresponding complete co-expression network contained 3,067 nodes and 52,081 links. Figure 2 shows a simplified version of the complete co-expression network where highly connected sub-networks are collapsed into single nodes (clusters) that thus represent several co-expressed genes (see Materials and Methods). Some of these clusters are associated with Gene Ontology (GO) [15] terms that are assigned more often to genes in that cluster than what one would expect by chance Figure 1. Overview of the data and methods used in the study. A co-expression network was inferred from gene expression, and promoter motifs were identified de novo from the genome sequences of orthologous species. The motif information was used to investigate if transcription factor neighborhoods were enriched for motifs compared to random network neighborhoods. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0113496.g001 Synergy: Exploring Gene Regulation in Synechocystis PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0113496 November 24, 2014 3 / 18 (false discovery rate (FDR) [16] corrected p-value ,0.05 or, equivalently, q-value ,0.05). We will refer to such statistically significant overrepresentation as enrichment. The dominating clusters in the network display genes encoding proteins related to energy metabolism, photosynthesis, translation and protein folding. These clusters stand out not only because they contain genes with stringent regulation under the majority of stress conditions tested, but also because these genes encode proteins with inter-functional dependency. As also previously noticed [9], the expression of ribosomal genes is correlated with the expression of energy producing pathways (photosynthesis and energy metabolism); shutting down the major energy producing pathways will result in temporary translational stop. Protection from reactive oxygen species (ROS) is of tremendous importance for an oxygen-producing organism like Synechocystis, which is reflected by the central location of the cluster representing genes coding for enzymes involved in protein folding. Co-expression networks can be used to quantify the importance of a gene by reporting several different measures of network centrality calculated for the node representing that gene. The degree centrality of a node is defined as the fraction of all nodes in the network that are directly connected to it (i.e. neighbors). The betweenness centrality of a node is the fraction of times that node is in the shortest path between two other nodes in the network (the shortest path between two nodes in a network is the fewest number of links needed to travel from one node to the other).

An alternative simple approach for validation of peptide assignments is based on addition of decoy (reversed, randomized, or shuffled) sequences to the searched protein sequence database. The probabilistic modeling approach of PeptideProphet and the decoy strategy can be combined within a single semisupervised framework, leading to improved robustness and higher accuracy of computed probabilities even in the case of most challenging data sets. We present a semisupervised expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for constructing a Bayes classifier for peptide identification using the probability mixture model, extending PeptideProphet to incorporate decoy peptide matches. Using several data sets of varying complexity, from control protein mixtures to a human plasma sample, and using three commonly used database search programs, SEQUEST, MASCOT, and TANDEM/k-score, we illustrate that more accurate mixture estimation leads to an improved control of the false discovery rate in the classification of peptide assignments.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hyungwon Choi"", ids = ""33372512""); list(name = ""Alexey I.

7dbec4e9d0cf01aa94e19aaa44fc711cf619fcd3,Novel T7 Phage Display Library Detects Classifiers for Active Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Infection,"Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and transmitted through inhalation of aerosolized droplets. Eighty-five percent of new TB cases occur in resource-limited countries in Asia and Africa and fewer than 40% of TB cases are diagnosed due to the lack of accurate and easy-to-use diagnostic assays. Currently, diagnosis relies on the demonstration of the bacterium in clinical specimens by serial sputum smear microscopy and culture. These methods lack sensitivity, are time consuming, expensive, and require trained personnel. An alternative approach is to develop an efficient immunoassay to detect antibodies reactive to MTB antigens in bodily fluids, such as serum. Sarcoidosis and TB have clinical and pathological similarities and sarcoidosis tissue has yielded MTB components. Using sarcoidosis tissue, we developed a T7 phage cDNA library and constructed a microarray platform. We immunoscreened our microarray platform with sera from healthy (n = 45), smear positive TB (n = 24), and sarcoidosis (n = 107) subjects. Using a student t-test, we identified 192 clones significantly differentially expressed between the three groups at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.01. Among those clones, we selected the top ten most significant clones and validated them on independent test set. The area under receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for the top 10 significant clones was 1 with a sensitivity of 1 and a specificity of 1. Sequence analyses of informative phage inserts recognized as antigens by active TB sera may identify immunogenic antigens that could be used to develop therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines, as well as identify molecular targets for therapy.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Harvinder S.

Amygdala Subnuclei Volumes in First-episode Psychosis: Association with Childhood Adversity,"s for the Sixth Biennial SIRS Conference Poster Session III S391 targeting mitochondrial 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) to determine microglial activation and a T1 MRI scan to study structural brain characteristics including brain volume, cortical thickness, and hippocampal shape. Results: Using a vertex-wise analysis, we observed a significant microglial activation-by-diagnostic group interaction in morphological measures across the left hippocampus. We observed associations between microglial activation and outward and inward morphological alterations in the dorsal and ventro-medial portions of the left hippocampus, respectively. These associations were only observed in first-episode psychosis group. There was no association between [18F]FEPPA binding and other structural brain characteristics. Discussion: Our results, for the first time, suggest a connection between microglial activation and morphological alterations in hippocampus of first-episode psychosis. S170. AMYGDALA SUBNUCLEI VOLUMES IN FIRST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS: ASSOCIATION WITH CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY Reetta-Liina Armio*,1, Heikki Laurikainen1, Raimo Salokangas1, Lauri Tuominen2, Jarmo Hietala1 1University of Turku; 2Harvard University, University of Turku Background: The amygdala volume is reduced already in the first episode of psychosis. The amygdala is a key region in emotional processing, and its volume reduction has been associated with severity of childhood adversity in psychotic patients. Since the amygdala is comprised of separate subnuclei with distinct anatomy and function we wanted to study whether these effects are present in some subnuclei more than others in first episode of psychosis. Methods: We studied amygdala subnuclei volumes in 68 first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients (mean age = 27.1 Â± 6.2, 35 females) and 65 healthy controls (mean 28.9 Â± 6.5, 33 females) randomly selected from the general population. Subjects underwent a T1-weighted MRI with 1mm isotropic resolution (Philips Ingenuity 3T). The subnuclei volumes were generated with a new automated algorithm in FreeSurfer. Childhood adversity was measured using the Trauma and Distress Scale Scores (TADS). Baseline group differences in the amygdala subnuclei volumes were tested using repeated measures general linear model. The analyses were restricted to the four largest subnuclei: the lateral, basal, accessory basal, and the corticoamygdaloid transition area with volumes > 100 mm3. There were no differences between hemispheres nor group by hemisphere interactions so left and right hemispheres were averaged. All group comparisons were corrected for age, sex, and total intracranial volume. Association between the volumes and the TADS scores in the FEP group were also corrected for cumulative exposure to antipsychotic medication. Results: We found that amygdala subnuclei were smaller in the FEP patients than in the the controls with regional specifity (subnucleus ROI*Group p  =  0.015). In the FEP, the most robust reductions were in the lateral nucleus (Bonferroni corrected p = 0.036, Î² = -64.15). No statistically significant difference was observed in the basal nucleus, the accessory basal nucleus or the corticoamygdaloid transition area. The FEP patients had in average higher TADS total score (19.00 Â± 13.56) compared to the HC (7.68 Â± 7.07) (p < 0.001, t = 5.84). We found that particularly the TADS physical abuse score (FEP(n)=63, HC(n)=59) associated significantly differently with some subnuclei in patients and control group (ROI*Group*Physical abuse p  =  0.016). The difference was significant only in the lateral nucleus (Group*Physical abuse p = 0.048, Î² = -34.97). However, there was an overall nonsignificant trend of the negative association between lateral nucleus volume and all TADS scores in the FEP. Similar trend was not seen in the controls. Discussion: We show that the amygdala subnuclei are differently affected already in the first episode of psychosis. Compared to the controls, the FEP patients had smaller lateral nucleus volume, but not basal, accessory basal nucleus or corticoamygdaloid transition area. The lateral nucleus volume was also negatively associated with childhood traumatic experiences, particularly physical abuse in the FEP patients. These findings suggest the involvement of the lateral nucleus of amygdala in the association between childhood traumatic experiences and psychotic disorders. This is well in agreement with studies suggesting that the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is associated with fear learning, recovery from fear and regulation of fear expression. S171. ALTERED WHITE MATTER CONNECTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA USING PUBLIC NEUROIMAGING DATA FROM SCHIZCONNECT Sung Woo Joo1, Woon Yoon2, Seung-Hyun Shon2, Saetbyeol Chat2, JungSun Lee*,3 1University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center; 2Asan Medical Center; 3University of Ulsan College of Medicine Background: Several studies have produced a large body of evidence for white matter abnormalities related to schizophrenia. The literature has yet to achieve a state of consistency and reproducibility, and reported low integrity of white matter tracts vary between studies. Whole brain image study with large sample size is needed to address this issue. We investigated white matter integrity in connections between regions of interests (ROI) in the same hemisphere in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls with public neuroimaging data from SchizConnect (http://schizconnect. org). Methods: A final data set was consisted of 129 healthy controls and 122 schizophrenia patients. For each diffusion weighted image (DWI), a twotensor full-brain tractography was performed, and DWI images were parcellated by processing and registering the T1 images with FreeSurfer and the Advanced Normalization Tools. We extracted a total of 36 tracts in the both hemisphere connecting ROIs in the same hemisphere with white matter query language. We compared means of diffusion measures between patients and controls, and evaluated correlations with Letter-number sequencing (LNS) test, Vocabulary test, letter fluency test, category fluency test, and trails A of the Trail Making Test (TMT). The BenjaminiHochberg procedure with false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Results: We found a significant RD and TR increase of the left thalamooccipital tracts and the right uncinate fascicle (UF), and a significant RD increase of the right middle longitudinal fascicle (MDLF), and the right superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF) ii in schizophrenia. There were correlations between the TR in the left thalamo-occipital tracts and letter fluency test, and the RD in the right SLF ii and LNS test, which did not survive after correction for multiple comparisons. Discussion: These results indicate widespread abnormalities of white matter fiber tracts in schizophrenia, contributing to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. S172.

c6a3b7a2194c8adab3d9b268a8c99d8fb4ea70ea,THU0519 Xanthine Oxidase Gene Variants and Their Association with Blood Pressure and Incident Hypertension: A Population Study,"Background Uric acid has been associated with blood pressure and hypertension. During the final stage of purine metabolism xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) produces uric acid, while at the same time reactive oxygen species are formed. We hypothesized that uric acid production, as assessed indirectly from XOR variants, is associated with hypertension (figure 1). Objectives The aim of the present study is to investigate the association of variants in the XOR gene with blood pressure and the development of hypertension. Methods Analyses were conducted in the prospective Flemish FLEMENGHO and European EPOGH study. Among 2769 participants (48.3% men; mean age 40.7 years) we genotyped 25 XOR SNPs and measured blood pressure at baseline and follow-up (median 8.8 years). The relation between variants of the XOR gene with changes in pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure over time; and incidence of hypertension, were analysed using multivariable mixed models and cox-regression, respectively. Results Compared with major allele homozygotes, pulse pressure increased approximately 2 mm Hg more in minor allele carriers of rs11904439 ( P= value 0.01), whereas mean arterial pressure and diastolic blood pressure increased approximately 1 mm Hg less in minor allele carriers of rs2043013 ( P =0.01). In 2050 participants normotensive at baseline, hazard ratios contrasting risk of hypertension in minor allele carriers vs. major allele homozygotes was 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03â€“1.68) for rs11904439 and 1.69 (95% CI 1.11â€“2.57) for rs148756340. With the false discovery rate set at 0.25, the aforementioned associations retained significance. The changes in systolic blood pressure from baseline to follow-up and the serum levels of uric acid at baseline (n=1949) were not associated with XOR . Conclusions In conclusion, pending confirmation in appropriately powered cohort studies, our findings suggest that variation in uric acid production, as captured by genetic variation in XOR , might be a predictor of changes in pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure and in the risk of hypertension.

e62b1f0b9429e01a6f296aaa9df71c443d741303,Identifying potentially common genes between dyslipidemia and osteoporosis using novel analytical approaches,"Dyslipidemia (DL) is closely related to osteoporosis (OP), while the exact common genetic mechanisms are still largely unknown. We proposed to use novel genetic analysis methods with pleiotropic information to identify potentially novel and/or common genes for the potential shared pathogenesis associated with OP and/or DL. We assessed the pleiotropy between plasma lipid (PL) and femoral neck bone mineral density (FNK BMD). We jointly applied the conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method and the genetic analysis incorporating pleiotropy and annotation (GPA) method to the summary statistics provided by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of FNK BMD (nâ€‰=â€‰49,988) and PL (nâ€‰=â€‰188,577) to identify potentially novel and/or common genes for BMD/PL. We found strong pleiotropic enrichment between PL and FNK BMD. Two hundred and forty-five PL SNPs were identified as potentially novel SNPs by cFDR and GPA. The corresponding genes were enriched in gene ontology (GO) terms â€œphospholipid homeostasisâ€ and â€œchylomicron remnant clearanceâ€. Three SNPs (rs2178950, rs9939318, and rs9368716) might be the pleiotropic ones and the corresponding genes NLRC5 (rs2178950) and TRPS1 (rs9939318) were involved in NF-ÎºB signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway as well as inflammation and innate immune processes. Our study validated the pleiotropy between PL and FNK BMD, and corroborated the reliability and high-efficiency of cFDR and GPA methods in further analyses of existing GWASs with summary statistics. We identified potentially common and/or novel genes for PL and/or FNK BMD, which may provide new insight and direction for further research.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xu Ping Lin"", ids = ""48030238""); list(name = ""Cheng Peng"", ids = ""144343071""); list(name = ""Jonathan Greenbaum"", ids = ""39598482""); list(name = ""Zhang-Fang Li"", ids = ""15401167""); list(name = ""Ke-hao Wu"", ids = ""3878335""); list(name = ""Zeng-Xin Ao"", ids = ""35050395""); list(name = ""Tong Zhang"", ids = ""47593026""); list(name = ""Jie Shen"", ids = ""144539948""); list(name = ""Hong-Wen Deng"", ids = ""144156424"")",d3fece08204d4a0208b019f763f6724e094d6385; 0cd671c33f3806e8adeec5e1dab5ab656ad532ca,e42fd58666ae0917353547e99744f9fccd5cfd68; c58e7c86a854efd8f1527621ab844f7673072261; 4bd5ae573dce419f5c63585d7f5a3f9b19e33c32; fb11029ae237335e1230f5329980c314fcb02597; 8e93aa1389bb07b75cde0899bb3ed45d53e81d2c; 1018674a361826d31f3e69f2941160e5ac4ff517; 3cd84380e71441e5231711900c6144da39b6e6dc; 9f06b58ddb77d8d70a1f0f6ba954d2a5cd2e4799; 02942a34ef900d182a6a5a79c3063dbffc513edc; 89150a1ddaca5f4e0aa1a4ecb9afd53faf77f1e5; c1912d567cc5226f9d0a63d2760cbac500d52f73; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; 18ab49c412c20a6ec8a4f1db5b3c1b6fe52cfd4d; 80ae5a321d761df8c56051e9c35138dd3ae7767b; 6480039b32988cf83bde873263b09897e14d551e; d283043903624ffe63fbbd970d75924405fe4107; 0cb7796010d4c67556a9dbb29e2a8faf3a283252; 1135388ec329834d8f66a1af044d2396062caa3e; 59e6c21674764f2b1e71b734e6e8e49a3a96c7a9; 9fdfba4f245a342bb8190ccae08de49aee231bf5; 496ec4ee00a9468215ebf634e5998a91939d36ae; 44dd0df968f730590625299e03e0e231b7692bcf; 97a9a693d68f56eaa812afef4e2db2bef490a963; 27a2b2a749a9d6cc12ab67283efcabdc6065a0cc; 11a3ac464b7cc5afe48172efe12ce4346dbf452d; 84fa2b2628d98e210bf1a9d48b7bf1d3f5ca34a5; 677259d97ae79c7ba13a66cd0b1e86eb7d847705; 7a332d53e30c0d2e3991a64614e3c44369a262f7; 85eb3a83bca3663b7f963267693b868ef3eee6a5; 65ae34915b43cd7c0030c74a7c2def7b321bed89; dfb897857a2c2dac8f656ea44362287274ed33a1; 9aeff5467a054bc032fef3b6d52f6f66fe05fdf3; f40600e93af08c47a51ad3f54588df798a6fbf5d; 1dcce488b859d208d5be2212693d9af4af4c91ca; 7a0962d050491c914be9fcb33c14a4618497902f; bf569f16da00b8941a61d9ffc4d18c5faedca081; f68c3280c9397343652add21b4e15de0f14cb4ac; a1dde44dc7240018c725cfec175ee4b06e7356e2; 1d7c51a2928d87ed3cb5fc89477c1b5ee015f09b; 23bade38355e9257eab9d9a78cff56515c82a5b1; f677f3271e3115581d8ab7aec8cb5a91ce23c231; 86cd7d29d023097741300662ee029a7c93f27be0; f8772e7932ca2f43a0baf37271f7dad124e1ef3b; 35cd2171fc6e4545eb53d3adf82f61fee2efbe3f; 0b31c136b25d81fd85aefd70b47788fe75aadc26; b53bc77ba8ec43da573acaec4bb36ea04541713b; efbe00cc2430f0b722f267a6660d892d0179b929; 357a29d507b392c022dc78c11d7353d75810ac55,Molecular Genetics and Genomics,293,711-723

One of the important problems in the analysis of microarray data is the identification of differentially expressed genes. Commonly used approaches for identifying differentially expressed genes are fold change, standard t-test, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) and regularized t-test (Cyber-T). In the present study the generalized p-value method is used to test the differential expression of individual genes. We used the environmental microarray data set to test the proposed method and compared with existing methods considering univariate testing problem for each gene.

f3e02285bb38a07586acff269957a27549385fd2,Bioinformatics analysis of a long non-coding RNA and mRNA regulation network in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion based on RNA sequencing,"Long nonâ€‘coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proven to be critical gene regulators of development and disease. The main aim of the present study was to elucidate the lncRNAâ€‘mRNA regulation network in ischemic stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using RNA sequencing (RNAâ€‘seq) in rats. lncRNA expression profiles were screened in brain tissues to identify a number of differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) and genes (DEGs) by RNAâ€‘seq. Reverse transcriptionâ€‘quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to further confirm the lncRNA expression data. Furthermore, Gene OntologyÂ (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and GenomesÂ (KEGG) pathway analysis were used to mine mRNA functions, and a lncRNAâ€‘mRNA network was constructed. Additionally, cisâ€‘Â and transâ€‘regulatory gene analyses of DELs were predicted. A total of 134Â DELs (fold changeÂ >2, false discovery rateÂ <0.05) and 1,006Â DEGs (fold changeÂ >2 and P<0.05) were identified. Eighteen lncRNAs were predicted to regulate heme oxygenaseÂ 1, mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinaseÂ B, chemokine ligandÂ 2 and DNA TopoisomeraseÂ IIÎ±, amongst other genes. These genes are all associated with a cellular response to inorganic substances, alkaloids, estradiol, reactive oxygen species, metal ions, oxidative stress, and are associated with metabolic pathways, chemokine signaling pathways, malaria, Parkinson's disease, the cell cycle and other GO and KEGGÂ pathway enrichments.

a80ba5b7c4ea6551a6f4ab64fde15819125bd1cb,Statistical Methods for Detecting Differentially Abundant Features in Clinical Metagenomic Samples,"Numerous studies are currently underway to characterize the microbial communities inhabiting our world. These studies aim to dramatically expand our understanding of the microbial biosphere and, more importantly, hope to reveal the secrets of the complex symbiotic relationship between us and our commensal bacterial microflora. An important prerequisite for such discoveries are computational tools that are able to rapidly and accurately compare large datasets generated from complex bacterial communities to identify features that distinguish them.We present a statistical method for comparing clinical metagenomic samples from two treatment populations on the basis of count data (e.g. as obtained through sequencing) to detect differentially abundant features. Our method, Metastats, employs the false discovery rate to improve specificity in high-complexity environments, and separately handles sparsely-sampled features using Fisher's exact test. Under a variety of simulations, we show that Metastats performs well compared to previously used methods, and significantly outperforms other methods for features with sparse counts. We demonstrate the utility of our method on several datasets including a 16S rRNA survey of obese and lean human gut microbiomes, COG functional profiles of infant and mature gut microbiomes, and bacterial and viral metabolic subsystem data inferred from random sequencing of 85 metagenomes. The application of our method to the obesity dataset reveals differences between obese and lean subjects not reported in the original study. For the COG and subsystem datasets, we provide the first statistically rigorous assessment of the differences between these populations. The methods described in this paper are the first to address clinical metagenomic datasets comprising samples from multiple subjects. Our methods are robust across datasets of varied complexity and sampling level. While designed for metagenomic applications, our software can also be applied to digital gene expression studies (e.g. SAGE). A web server implementation of our methods and freely available source code can be found at http://metastats.cbcb.umd.edu/.",2009,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""James Robert White"", ids = ""49884811"");

f6ce93a1cb3f56b04360612dcbe362064b02ca77,MicroRNAs enrichment in GWAS of complex human phenotypes,"BackgroundThe genotype information carried by Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) seems to have the potential to explain more of the â€˜missing heritabilityâ€™ of complex human phenotypes, given improved statistical approaches. Several lines of evidence support the involvement of microRNA (miRNA) and other non-coding RNA in complex human traits and diseases.We employed a novel, genetic annotation-informed enrichment method for GWAS that captures more polygenic effects than standard GWAS analysis, to investigate if miRNA-tagging Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are enriched of associations with 15 complex human phenotypes. We then leveraged the enrichment using a conditional False Discovery Rate (condFDR) approach to assess any improvement in the detection of individual miRNA SNPs associated with the disorders.ResultsWe found SNPs tagging miRNA transcription regions to be significantly enriched of associations with 10 of 15 phenotypes. The enrichment remained significant after controlling for affiliation to other genomic categories, and was confirmed by replication. Albeit only nominally significant, enrichment was found also in miRNA binding sites for 10 phenotypes out of 15. Leveraging the enrichment in the condFDR framework, we observed a 2-4-fold increase in discovery of SNPs tagging miRNA regions.ConclusionsOur results suggest that miRNAs play an important role in the polygenic architecture of complex human disorders and traits, and therefore that miRNAs are a genomic category that can and should be used to improve gene discovery.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Luiz F Goulart"", ids = ""46480575""); list(name = ""Francesco Bettella"", ids = ""2792807""); list(name = ""Ida E SÃ¸nderby"", ids = ""3693852""); list(name = ""Andrew J.

02f616785a796c5550c5abae2f5b65464e2d4e20,Effect of culture conditions on microRNA expression in primary adult control and COPD lung fibroblasts in vitro,"In vitro cell cultures, including lung fibroblasts, have been used to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis. However, culture conditions may affect miRNA expression. We examined whether miRNA expression in primary adult lung fibroblasts varies with cell density or passage in vitro and whether culture conditions confound the identification of altered miRNA expression in COPD lung fibroblasts. Primary adult control and COPD lung fibroblasts were cultured until passage 3 or 8, after which cells were further cultured for 3 or 7Â d (low vs. high density). Then, cells at low density were cultured with serum-free media, and those at high density were cultured with serum-free media in the absence or presence of interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) for 24Â h. RNA was extracted to perform miRNA microarray from which 1.25-fold differential expression and 10% false discovery rate were applied to identify â€œinvariantâ€ and â€œvariantâ€ miRNA for the various culture conditions. Of the 2226 miRNAs evaluated, 39.0% for cell density, 40.7% for cell passage, and 29.4% for both conditions were identified as â€œinvariantâ€ miRNAs. Furthermore, 38.1% of the evaluated miRNAs were â€œinvariantâ€ for cell passage with IL-1Î² and TNF-Î±. Differentially expressed miRNAs between control and COPD lung fibroblasts were identified with and without IL-1Î² and TNF-Î±, and of these, 32 out of the 34 top-ranked miRNAs exceeded the differences due to culture conditions. Thus, culture conditions may affect miRNA expression of adult human lung fibroblasts. Nevertheless, in vitro cultures can be used to assess differential miRNA expression in COPD lung fibroblasts.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jun Ikari"", ids = ""2487115""); list(name = ""Lynette M Smith"", ids = ""144643124""); list(name = ""Amy J.

48c365fb304da4cad6389df84d8dac2828724d77,Marginal false discovery rate control for likelihood-based penalized regression models.,"The popularity of penalized regression in high-dimensional data analysis has led to a demand for new inferential tools for these models. False discovery rate control is widely used in high-dimensional hypothesis testing, but has only recently been considered in the context of penalized regression. Almost all of this work, however, has focused on lasso-penalized linear regression. In this paper, we derive a general method for controlling the marginal false discovery rate that can be applied to any penalized likelihood-based model, such as logistic regression and Cox regression. Our approach is fast, flexible and can be used with a variety of penalty functions including lasso, elastic net, MCP, and MNet. We derive theoretical results under which the proposed method is valid, and use simulation studies to demonstrate that the approach is reasonably robust, albeit slightly conservative, when these assumptions are violated. Despite being conservative, we show that our method often offers more power to select causally important features than existing approaches.

43d1f04b4bd3f19d00cacc52837a8efc300f66a0,Metabolic signatures and risk of type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population: an untargeted metabolomics study using both LC-MS and GC-MS,"Aims/hypothesisMetabolomics has provided new insight into diabetes risk assessment. In this study we characterised the human serum metabolic profiles of participants in the Singapore Chinese Health Study cohort to identify metabolic signatures associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.MethodsIn this nested caseâ€“control study, baseline serum metabolite profiles were measured using LC-MS and GC-MS during a 6-year follow-up of 197 individuals with type 2 diabetes but without a history of cardiovascular disease or cancer before diabetes diagnosis, and 197 healthy controls matched by age, sex and date of blood collection.ResultsA total of 51 differential metabolites were identified between cases and controls. Of these, 35 were significantly associated with diabetes risk in the multivariate analysis after false discovery rate adjustment, such as increased branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), non-esterified fatty acids (palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid) and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) species (16:1, 18:1, 18:2, 20:3, 20:4 and 22:6). A combination of six metabolites including proline, glycerol, aminomalonic acid, LPI (16:1), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionic acid and urea showed the potential to predict type 2 diabetes in at-risk individuals with high baseline HbA1c levels (â‰¥6.5% [47.5Â mmol/mol]) with an AUC of 0.935. Combined lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG) (12:0) and LPI (16:1) also showed the potential to predict type 2 diabetes in individuals with normal baseline HbA1c levels (<6.5% [47.5Â mmol/mol]; AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.781).Conclusions/interpretationOur findings show that branched-chain amino acids and NEFA are potent predictors of diabetes development in Chinese adults.

790ee595ae9cddf5253a402a8e5a30903a90490f,ROCker: accurate detection and quantification of target genes in short-read metagenomic data sets by modeling sliding-window bitscores,"Functional annotation of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data sets relies on similarity searches based on e-value thresholds resulting in an unknown number of false positive and negative matches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ROCker, aimed at identifying position-specific, most-discriminant thresholds in sliding windows along the sequence of a target protein, accounting for non-discriminative domains shared by unrelated proteins. ROCker employs the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to minimize false discovery rate (FDR) and calculate the best thresholds based on how simulated shotgun metagenomic reads of known composition map onto well-curated reference protein sequences and thus, differs from HMM profiles and related methods. We showcase ROCker using ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) genes, mediating oxidation of ammonia and the reduction of the potent greenhouse gas, N2O, to inert N2, respectively. ROCker typically showed 60-fold lower FDR when compared to the common practice of using fixed e-values. Previously uncounted â€˜atypicalâ€™ nosZ genes were found to be two times more abundant, on average, than their typical counterparts in most soil metagenomes and the abundance of bacterial amoA was quantified against the highly-related particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA). Therefore, ROCker can reliably detect and quantify target genes in short-read metagenomes.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Luis H Orellana"", ids = ""145505087""); list(name = ""Luis M Rodriguez-R"", ids = ""1400869603""); list(name = ""Konstantinos T.

991d8d7039f5b24ed26bb29b196de0b3196484d3,Immune adaptation to chronic intense exercise training: new microarray evidence,"BackgroundEndurance exercise training, especially the high-intensity training, exhibits a strong influence on the immune system. However, the mechanisms underpinning the immune-regulatory effect of exercise remain unclear. Consequently, we chose to investigate the alterations in the transcriptional profile of blood leukocytes in young endurance athletes as compared with healthy sedentary controls, using Affymetrix human gene 1.1 ST array.ResultsGroup differences in the transcriptome were analyzed using Intensity-based Hierarchical Bayes method followed by a Logistic Regression-based gene set enrichment method.We identified 72 significant transcripts differentially expressed in the leukocyte transcriptome of young endurance athletes as compared with non-athlete controls with a false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05, comprising mainly the genes encoding ribosomal proteins and the genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Gene set enrichment analysis identified three major gene set clusters: two were up-regulated in athletes including gene translation and ribosomal protein production, and mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation and biogenesis; one gene set cluster identified as transcriptionally downregulated in athletes was related to inflammation and immune activity.ConclusionOur data indicates that in young healthy individuals, intense endurance exercise training (exemplifed by athletic training) can chronically induce transcriptional changes in the peripheral blood leukocytes, upregulating genes related to protein production and mitochondrial energetics, and downregulating genes involved in inflammatory response.

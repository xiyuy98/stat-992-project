6e3fb03bdb53fb1a462f31e2a18198a858f912be,[Genome-wide association study on complex diseases: genetic statistical issues].,"Since the first genome-wide association study on human age-related macular degeneration was reported by Sci-ence journal in 2005,a series of genome-wide association studies have been published on human complex diseases or traits,such as obesity,type 2 diabetes,coronary artery disease,Alzheimer's disease and so on.The study of human genetics has recently undergone a dramatic transition which is called ""the first wave of genome-wide association study"".Some issues in statistical analysis of genome-wide association studies were reviewed by this paper.First,statistical analysis guidelines,methods and examples for genome-wide association studies of different designs,including unrelated case-control studies,population-based studies,and family-based association studies;second,multiple testing correction of P values,including Bonferroni correction,step-down Bonferroni correction,permutation correction,and the correction based on false discovery rate;third,population stratification and its effect on inference of genotype-phenotype associations.The False Positive Re-port Probability has been successfully applied in a recent genome-wide association study on coronary artery disease to con-trol the population stratification.Although genetic statistical methodology has been greatly developed in control of false positive associations caused by multiple testing or population stratification,it is still not sufficient to achieve the goal.Rep-licating genotype-phenotype associations is the only way to identify true association between genetic markers and common disease traits.The first wave of genome-wide association studies is producing an impressive list of unexpected associations between genes or chromosomal regions and a broad range of diseases.Traditional statistical techniques are adequate for the analysis and interpretation of these results.However,much more sophisticated methods of statistical analysis are likely to be required as we delve further into the genome in the search for networks of interacting gene variants,or interactions be-tween gene-gene networks and environmental factors.Finally,some useful links about statistical software for genome-wide association studies were provided.",2008,Biology,"list(name = ""Yan Wl"", ids = ""83326374"")",,,Hereditas,30,543

PANTHER showed HFF proteins were involved in complement and coagulation cascade, growth factor and hormone, immunity, and transportation, KEGG indicated their pathway, and STRING demonstrated their interaction networks. In comparison, 32% and 50% of proteins have not been reported in previous human follicular fluid and plasma.ConclusionsOur HFF proteome research provided a new complementary high-confidence dataset of folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation environment. Those proteins associated with innate immunity, complement cascade, blood coagulation, and angiogenesis might serve as the biomarkers of female infertility and IVF outcome, and their pathways facilitated a complete exhibition of reproductive process.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaofang Shen"", ids = ""2638612""); list(name = ""Xin Liu"", ids = ""1731144""); list(name = ""Peng Zhu"", ids = ""144180897""); list(name = ""Yuhua Zhang"", ids = ""1819253""); list(name = ""Jiahui Wang"", ids = ""3067121""); list(name = ""Yanwei Wang"", ids = ""6483085""); list(name = ""Wenting Wang"", ids = ""2750211""); list(name = ""Juan Liu"", ids = ""37427978""); list(name = ""Ning Li"", ids = ""144419331""); list(name = ""Fujun Liu"", ids = ""12217443"")",d4c7c509e8f7e3f8166e153f1a44c9636c154ca4; 0b0972bec0d2b41b750f51118af87af6877266bb; 0f2aedd129d2c41c07205731de4f75db1533b5dd; b907e2c2da2f0467435b96a8e1c3d3ef906fba21; 7447a338cec8fb0b8315df66b42a2097559bc2ef; 00c6d58549250a894ce1819a2d76ae5adea70f56; 6d609d3fa9fc117ad3b6573adec7bfb01141885c; 29eed05b639fda5ee4204cf3316f7e8351b1abea,b6dabbfedd0affd953ab0e208d829be8b94a2a85; 44e9724e896010039eddc9d9a3d2f67f2f2ecdf8; d4be4fdeaf557ffa55fd41e648bad2d4315b2efa; 098a5a8e7e79df67c3765daf9abada159604d8cd; 85f1fb1da488a14811420461628f41763d952150; aa512601e19d0aeba1e9fe2f538f33c3138806b9; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 3b7f4962786c088b23920e33e9cb464cdb20ab70; f1ade076d4599c4805cbeaf74e0d0ab39d0a401e; 9f9463e5daf10a2698109ebd523d99708cd69866; 56a26b8b749e408a1ec6194b4bdf69a90a51ccd0; a4272f516f54cb97dfef737377ffbb444cc88fdb; fab4ab266c7ae7f29eeeaee27a156d29be98a3d3; 5cefe7b9631fb53efe248a178ce6c43ed5c5203b; e105fc25e9f5011c5947a7a4a5eb6bc53bfe0c47; 467afcea94fe064c93e69bbacdb477108f1e42c1; b20dfd96fd307124811d3fefe575e4bcf4c5a510; 11cc4bd8c8bd3ba7cf708c52bedec53753034ff6; 7700fb9bdca3a716c7f5b89f66cf7540ba117a83; 300c3e81c70b00be34654e7289c3de17d859602f; 5057d8492659c2a9949ebac50be2ca3e484b1066; 089bfe6854bef8bed594aabccb8b6699ed6a2a53; 2415d04e892acf155e5f1ca7f827551f6ac3bd06; c258d0814ac16455fa48f752c22b3bd4bdce03c1; cd0617b0877995cb5a16a4b958c9e1ce25865227; 15150a8119441f782db71c8c6c788315154ca594; cca8890276765358e56264305aecc88cac695b47; 51c79b5b54208ea62966b685c49b88ff6d4d6b40; 6514654d76880decef9f4d5379fad69060716b4b; dbbe5e497c552e12c2c535ca6401b32ab56127a7; 37701b853250f6bbb4bab4c94e13b8486f6a89b2; 4dd579f8877583852da9ad4d64cf3c79fa49cd63; bab047cc2e4328d31eae2cef2ce5a1151d686660; 6cd37be50f29ae9a182d8779a91c904566afdee4; 9b0c28a4ecb273d653a2d3c44fe1dc6511ee1238; 8cf6d256b1cab0edd0bb67b65b28ec5e0cad21f2; 485fbf965a6464882a17e32172ad5b3e925b188b; acc9108516d9e02ce558995dfc8be87e9c613324; 6c60d930cee8d6ce463912bcee9f4b24bbfe90c3; 3a6e3cd3a0b763865b6c432bf03d507185373211; 55e7f879c26109cea0cf059b8de640bcf6a0843b; 9e870e779742521fa376031f7d2f8dacb84b87b9; b133e978fa83cbd8b0c857f018ceda21b2ad3b65; 5af4ec93f207db98e2ea1f49c9db10b691144996; d27211bbcb870ba9363aa257909376a030393196; 2ee11c60e43f4733c377d8415573a9ba730d5a08; 3bfd12145b964f202162b98bd7f29b8ecd94e3dc,Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology : RB&E,15,

The successful predictively treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains a major challenge. Until now there is no definite marker to distinguish responder from non-responder and more and more important, metastasis occurred within different organs lead to serious variations of overall survival. In this study, paclitaxel and anthracyclines pretreated153 patients with MBC received 606 cycles of docetaxel plus thiotepa. 65 of 153 patients were concurrently diagnosed as MBC involved liver metastasis (LM). Among 153 patients, the response were 1 complete response (CR) (0.7%), 25 partial responses (PR) (16.3%), 73 stable diseases (SD) (47.7%), 46 progressive diseases (PD) (30.1%) and 8 unevaluable(5.2%). For LM patients, the localized liver response were 2 CR (3.1%), 20 PR (30.8%), 16 SD (24.6%), 22 PD (33.8%),5 unevaluable (7.7%). Median PFS and OS for both entire and LM subgroup were 6.5 (95% CI, 5.6 to 7.4) versus 4.2 (95%CI, 2.3-6.1), and 20.0 (95% CI, 15.6 to 24.4) versus 14.2 (95%CI, 9.5-18.9) months respectively. 79 SNPs in CYP450, whose minor allele frequency were â‰¥ 10% were genotyped. There was no significant difference of SNPs in therapeutic responses, PFS or OS. Of importance, there were two distinctive SNPs, rs2277119 and rs4646487 \*2/\*3 alleles, which tended to have the better liver metastases response than *1 when choosing a false discovery rate as 12%. It seemed that docetaxel plus thiotepa might be regarded as an active specific regimen for MBC with liver metastasis. The generation of conceptually specific chemotherapy targeting the organ with cancer metastasis should be considered in the future.

Herein, we report a comprehensive, replicated, false discovery rate-controlled dataset of DNase-hypersensitive (DHS) open chromatin regions for rat microglia. We compared the open chromatin landscapes in untreated primary microglial cultures and cultures stimulated for 6â€‰hr with either glioma-conditioned medium (GCM) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Glioma-secreted factors induce proinvasive and immunosuppressive activation of microglia, and these cells then promote tumor growth. The open chromatin landscape of the rat microglia consisted of 126,640 reproducible DHS regions, among which 2,303 and 12,357 showed a significant change in openness following stimulation with GCM or LPS, respectively. Active genes exhibited constitutively open promoters, but there was no direct dependence between the aggregated openness of DHS regions near a gene and its expression. Individual regions mapped to the same gene often presented different patterns of openness changes. GCM-regulated DHS regions were more frequent in areas away from gene bodies, while LPS-regulated regions were more frequent in introns. GCM and LPS differentially affected the openness of regions mapped to immune checkpoint genes. The two treatments differentially affected the aggregated openness of regions mapped to genes in the Toll-like receptor signaling and axon guidance pathways, suggesting that the molecular machinery used by migrating microglia is similar to that of growing axons and that modulation of these pathways is instrumental in the induction of proinvasive polarization of microglia by glioma. Our dataset of open chromatin regions paves the way for studies of gene regulation in rat microglia.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Piotr Przanowski"", ids = ""49049532""); list(name = ""Shamba S Mondal"", ids = ""7658044""); list(name = ""Aleksandra Cabaj"", ids = ""35106743""); list(name = ""Konrad J.

For this test, maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates for propagation delay, direction of arrival, direction of departure, and Doppler shifts are required for each potential number of propagation paths. The ML-estimator is implemented via a variant of the space alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. The proposed test is based on the Benjamini- Hochberg procedure for guaranteeing a false discovery rate and employs the simple bootstrap approach for approximating the required p-values for the multiple test.

However, the molecular mechanisms of action are still unclear. Therefore, this study used a transcriptomic approach to help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying such isomer-specific effects. Caco-2 cells were treated with 80 micromol/L linoleic acid (control), 80 micromol/L trans-10, cis-12 CLA, or 80 micromol/L cis-9, trans-11 CLA for 12 d. Ca transport was measured radio-isotopically. RNA was isolated from the cells, labeled, and hybridized to the Affymetrix U133 2.0 Plus arrays (n = 3). Data and functional analysis was preformed using Bioconductor. Using a minimum fold-change criterion of 1.6 and a false discovery rate criterion of P-value <or= 0.05, trans-10, cis-12 CLA altered the expression of 918 genes, whereas, cis-9, trans-11 CLA had no effect on gene expression. Gene ontology analysis revealed that trans-10, cis-12 CLA strongly modulated a number of processes inherently related to carcinogenesis, such as cell cycle, cell proliferation, and DNA metabolism. Trans-10, cis-12 CLA, but not cis-9, trans-11 CLA, increased transepithelial Ca transport in Caco-2 cells, which corresponded to changes in molecular mediators of paracellular (including claudin 2 and 4) and transcellular (calbindin D(9)k and vitamin D receptor) Ca transport. This microarray-based study highlighted a number of gene expression patterns of relevance to 2 important intestinal processes (carcinogenesis and Ca transport), which were modulated by trans-10, cis-12 CLA.

67087acca9684a8dddddbbf5782ee5063aad498c,Abstract P4-04-20: Subtype specific differential expression and immunogenicity of endogenous retrovirus elements in breast cancer,"Background: Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are germline encoded DNA sequences that entered the human genome millions of years ago. While they are mostly inactivated due to accumulated termination codons and deletions, previous studies have demonstrated overexpression and antibody-targeted immunotherapeutic potential, of ERV-related env proteins in breast cancer. We sought to elucidate subtype specificity, immunogenicity, and correlation with innate immunity related gene signatures of ERVs in breast cancer. Methods: We utilized publically available RNASeq gene expression data of breast cancer samples along and corresponding matched normals from TCGA. The dataset included 191 ER-/HER2- (TN), 197 HER2+, and 627 ER+/HER2- (Luminal) breast cancers. ERV expression was obtained by mapping bowtie2-aligned reads of recently annotated to be transcriptionally active to the RNAseq bam files (Rooney et al 2015, Mayer et al 2011). ERVs preferentially expressed in tumors compared normal tissue were identified as those for which the 5th percentile of ERV expression in the tumors exceeded the 95th percentile of ERV expression in the normal samples. A gene signature involving GZMB, PRF1, CXCL13, IRF1, IKZF1, and HLA-E was used as a measure of immune activity. To assess the immunogenic potential of the tumor-specific ERVs, we compared the expression level of the ERV within the lower and higher immune signature tertiles using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. To elucidate mechanism of potential immune response, ERVs found to be significantly associated with immune response at a false discovery rate of Results: Out of the 66 original annotated ERVs, 47 were found to be expressed at significantly higher levels in breast cancer compared to normal tissue and 22 were immunogenic. Examples include members of the ERV-K family, as have also been previously detected by flow cytometry and IHC. Subtype-specific immunogenic potential was demonstrated in 4 ERVs in TNBC (ERVK10, ERVK17, ERVFRD.1, ERVPABLB.1) and in 7 ERVs in the luminal subtype (ERV3.1, ERVE.4, ERVFRD.2, ERVK.15, ERVK.19, ERVK.20, ERVK.25, ERVW.3). Twelve of the 22 immunogenic ERVs were significantly correlated with expression of all ten TLR evaluated, while four ERVs showed more specific correlation patterns with TLRs. High ERV3.1 expression was associated with high TLR3, TLR8, TLR9 that specifically target double stranded or single stranded RNA, suggesting a potential mechanism for mediation of ERV related immune response. Conclusion: Our results suggest breast cancer subtype specific ERV dysregulation and immunogenicity. The potentially immunogenic ERVs were generally not self-correlated or located in the same amplicon as HLA genes, suggesting an independent immune response pathway. Furthermore, ERV expression correlates with specific endosomal nucleic-acid recognizing toll-like receptors, which may prompt further investigation into subtype-specific TLR-targeted therapy.

6ae3450e6c10d94298bfb1f5a61125f997bf4c26,Detection of genes influencing economic traits in three French dairy cattle breeds,"A project of QTL detection was carried out in the French Holstein, Normande, and MontbÃ©liarde dairy cattle breeds. This granddaughter design included 1 548 artificial insemination bulls distributed in 14 sire families and evaluated after a progeny-test for 24 traits (production, milk composition, persistency, type, fertility, mastitis resistance, and milking ease). These bulls were also genotyped for 169 genetic markers, mostly microsatellites. The QTL were analysed by within-sire linear regression of daughter yield deviations or deregressed proofs on the probability that the son receives one or the other paternal QTL allele, given the marker information. QTL were detected for all traits, including those with a low heritability. One hundred and twenty QTL with a chromosome-wise significance lower than 3% were tabulated. This threshold corresponded to a 15% false discovery rate. Amongst them, 32 were genome-wise significant. Estimates of their contribution to genetic variance ranged from 6 to 40%.

ddc0baf38784a6a9aaf5c3285d4a3b900fcc9885,Which patients improve: characteristics increasing sensitivity to a supportive patient-practitioner relationship.,"Supportive social relationships, including a positive patient-practitioner relationship, have been associated with positive health outcomes. Using the data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) undertaken in the Boston area of the United States, this study sought to identify baseline factors predictive of patients' response to an experimentally applied supportive patient-practitioner relationship. To sort through the hundreds of potential attributes affecting the patient-practitioner relationship, we applied a false discovery rate method borrowed from the field of genomics and bioinformatics. To our knowledge such a method has not previously been applied to generate hypotheses from clinical trial data. In a previous RCT, our team investigated the effect of the patient-practitioner relationship on symptom improvement in patients with irritable Bowel syndrome (IBS). Data were collected on a sample of 289 individuals with IBS using a three-week, single blind, three arm, randomized controlled design. We found that a supportive patient-practitioner relationship significantly improved symptomatology and quality of life. A complex, multi-level measurement package was used to prospectively measure change and identify factors associated with improvement. Using a local false discovery rate procedure, we examined the association of 452 baseline subject variables with sensitivity to treatment. Out of 452 variables, only two baseline factors, reclusiveness, and previous trial experience increased sensitivity to the supportive patient-practitioner relationship. A third variable, additional opportunity during the study for subjects to discuss their illness through experiential interview, was associated with improved outcomes among subjects who did not receive the supportive patient-practitioner relationship. The few variables associated with differential benefit suggest that a patient-centered supportive patient-practitioner relationship may be beneficial for most patients. This may be especially important for reclusive individuals. Within the context of our study, additional study attention in the form of repeated experiential interviews compensated for a lack of positive patient-practitioner support.

a976d956bc29a5a6ca92a66150b1f4b7de0d43b9,Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Autoantibody Positivity in Type 1 Diabetes Cases,"The genetic basis of autoantibody production is largely unknown outside of associations located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. The aim of this study is the discovery of new genetic associations with autoantibody positivity using genome-wide association scan single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients with autoantibody measurements. We measured two anti-islet autoantibodies, glutamate decarboxylase (GADA, n = 2,506), insulinoma-associated antigen 2 (IA-2A, n = 2,498), antibodies to the autoimmune thyroid (Graves') disease (AITD) autoantigen thyroid peroxidase (TPOA, n = 8,300), and antibodies against gastric parietal cells (PCA, n = 4,328) that are associated with autoimmune gastritis. Two loci passed a stringent genome-wide significance level (p<10(-10)): 1q23/FCRL3 with IA-2A and 9q34/ABO with PCA. Eleven of 52 non-MHC T1D loci showed evidence of association with at least one autoantibody at a false discovery rate of 16%: 16p11/IL27-IA-2A, 2q24/IFIH1-IA-2A and PCA, 2q32/STAT4-TPOA, 10p15/IL2RA-GADA, 6q15/BACH2-TPOA, 21q22/UBASH3A-TPOA, 1p13/PTPN22-TPOA, 2q33/CTLA4-TPOA, 4q27/IL2/TPOA, 15q14/RASGRP1/TPOA, and 12q24/SH2B3-GADA and TPOA. Analysis of the TPOA-associated loci in 2,477 cases with Graves' disease identified two new AITD loci (BACH2 and UBASH3A).",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Vincent Plagnol"", ids = ""2021489""); list(name = ""Joanna M M Howson"", ids = ""4530422""); list(name = ""Deborah J.

cfce55ac7f315eda631ee6099537c5b06aecbd66,Transcriptome analysis reveals the effect of oral contraceptive use on cervical cancer,"Differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) correlated to oral contraceptives (OCs) were identified by comparing the transcriptomes of cervical cancer patients who have taken OCs and those who have not. Their biological functions and relevance to clinical manifestations were investigated further in order to gain an understanding of the pathogenesis of cervical cancer and provide potential therapeutic targets. Level 3 RNA-sequencing (seq) data for cervical squamous-cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma and the clinical information were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The present study analyzed the RNAâ€‘seq data and information on OC use of 35 patients [OC users (n=18) and those who have never used OCs (n=17)]. Student's tâ€‘test was used in order to identify DEGs and the false discovery rate (FDR) was estimated by a Beta-Uniform Mixture model, which was adopted in multiple testing corrections. A functional enrichment analysis was performed with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery tool and BioCarta. A total of 80 DEGs were identified in OC users while FDR=0.3 was set as the cut-off value. The metabolic process and human telomerase RNA gene transcription were significantly upregulated in DEGs. Furthermore, secreted LY6/PLAUR domain containing 1 was identified to be correlated to the pathological response, while the synapse defective 1 Rho GTPase homolog 2 was found to be significantly associated with the histological grade and overall survival time. In conclusion, present study shed light on the effect of OC use on the oncogenesis of the cervix and may indicate novel approaches for a targeted therapy of cervical cancer.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tian Gao"", ids = ""145331222""); list(name = ""Jianjun Wang"", ids = ""19175228""); list(name = ""Min Yang"", ids = ""144069924""); list(name = ""Huaifang Li"", ids = ""6197709"")",98dfb19fa2f63a4b7ebeff08408a16d01d0d54c6; e3495a68e8a5c03939ceefedd7d1e91c2ca237f9,edffc49fbe4568482ff0c0d416f61804a5a857c2; 294a4faf7f428c95d543f4b6515a3444abe6f46b; 7b05177814338002d83b64c786e6dccf7e57f51a; 121f0ef2aa1bd327eb2e183d1da8c9d8ee8097f0; 8db224ee7dbf360bbced1f67d605a12cbc10edaa; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 18843e61fbdebf7a0e55a6b841d89f66a2de99a3; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 5676f7b4488837d37052ddba667b4349cc63ec32; dd2cac67e5b6739eac239ebb27a03c88f3a6fac4; efb47506e082b9b7c290bee1c75f36560656a7cd; cab92a12d5baf147ce0e7fe1d9312792b4c6f53a; 6f8e3a8aed4edd9e8d2ec45b5478647d3c628f88; 00e89785dbc0621a0a58dd9a85ec0a7779975e22; befa2e527b300711d3eb47e14a4273cc34396f5e; 19fe7fd776ecb84f7dbb14049a4992f251a78e6a; da17518ea6a091f2d4a0d9bde9d3a25ddc3f65b7; 86e70a7473cb784979a93bfd781332e4f4182e79; fcf7baf95215565efe5d32d37c2e95d0318c60a5; aa92798ddbd31e87898a3ca59e4f822dfae9cff3; 02f195a8a80f4ab507119ed9a5d1f523d2b745e4; 03e51550b50aa96b9f64a8558661eeb34ea4134b; dc8e9e33cca8bb1faa0a20b2d693c94484e4ca2c; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; fb3efc67992699cce0c5a2b20bbe32365921021e; 1bc7ad6f95d0a13822f52f0dfbb489d5019e997e,Molecular Medicine Reports,10,1703 - 1708

cc8955137a56ab8e792f42faeb7ecee2245f2668,Abstract 1600: Interleukin-8 (IL-8) in TGF-Î² immunotherapy and chemotherapies,"Background: Increased expression of IL-8 and/or its receptors has been characterized in cancer cells, endothelial cells, infiltrating neutrophils, and tumor-associated macrophages, suggesting that IL-8 may function as a significant regulatory factor within the tumor microenvironment. OT-101 is a phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeting transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-Î²2). Herein, we examined the role of IL-8 in OT-101 treatment followed with chemotherapies during our Phase II trial in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (PAC). Methods: Time evolution of a panel of 31 cyto-/chemokine levels in plasma were tracked over 3 cycles of OT-101 administration (140 mg/m2/day) for 12 PAC patients. Samples were acquired before onset of OT-101 therapy and at 8 selected time points (Cycle 1 [Day 2 and 5], Cycle 2 [Days 1, 2, and 5], Final Visit, Cycle 3 [Day 5]) during the therapy. Samples were measured in duplicate and concentrations were expressed in pg/mL. Standardized log10 transformed values calculated from the mean and standard deviation of each cyto-/chemokine in each patient was utilized in an ANCOVA model to investigate the correlation with Overall Survival (OS). Results: Clustering of correlation coefficients resulted in the identification of three highly correlated subsets of cyto-/chemokines (Cluster 1: EGF, MIP-1Î±, MIP-1Î²; Cluster 2: FGF-2, IL-1RA, MIG, IP-10, IL-15, IFN-Î±, IL-12A/IL-12; Cluster 3: HGF, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8). Protein-Protein Interaction networks constructed using STRING10 algorithm identified a relationship between IL-8 and TGFÎ²R2 inhibition. The ANCOVA model explained a significant proportion of the observed data for Cycle 1[Day 2] measurements of cyto-/chemokines (R2 = 0.3, F59,217 = 1.575, P = 0.0103). Other time points did not exhibit a significant model fit or significant relationships in the interaction term. IL-8 expression showed significant association with OS (positive association, N=12, T-value = 2.92, P = 0.0039) at Cycle 1[Day 2] measurements (7% False Discovery Rate). Linear regression of the increase in IL-8 levels during Cycle 1[Day 2] treatment with OT-101 was related to an increase in OS outcome (R2 = 0.54). To further define the appropriate chemoagent to combine with OT-101, we evaluated paclitaxel (PTX), gemcitabine (GEM), and dacarbazine (DTIC) in animal model. Synergy was observed with PTX and DTIC, but not with GEM. Both PTX and DTIC induced IL-8 expression whereas, surprisingly, GEM reduced IL-8 expression. Conclusion: IL-8 expression during early phase of OT-101 treatment cycle was positively associated with OS across 12 patients. IL-8 is also induced by PTX and DTIC which synergized with OT-101. The data suggests that PAC and DTIC are acting on the same target as our TGF-Î²2 inhibitor; and potentially, the beneficial effect of these chemoagents is a result of chemoagent-induced immune/IL-8 response.

d3637d69a7710ecc6e985e8fc74e71cac486b914,Ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate for shotgun membrane proteomics,"The solubility and digestion efficiency are two crucial factors that might affect the identification of integral membrane proteins (IMPs). In this work, 1% (v/v) ionic liquid (IL), 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIM BF4), added in NH4HCO3 buffer (pHÂ 8.3), was applied as a sample preparation buffer for IMPs analysis. Compared to the commonly used sodium dodecyl sulfate and methanol methods, the number of identified IMPs from rat brain by microcolumn reversed phase liquid chromatography (Î¼RPLC)-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) was improved by over three times, which might be due to the fact that BMIM BF4 offered high solubilizing ability for IMPs and good compatibility for tryptic digestion. Furthermore, compared to Rapigest and urea methods, with BMIM BF4 method, the number of identified IMPs from rat brain could be improved 25% and 80%, respectively, which might be contributed to the good solubilizing ability and high thermal stability of such IL. With the sample treated by BMIM BF4 method, by 2D-nanoSCX-RPLC-ESI-MS/MS, 1,450 non-redundant proteins and 7,978 unique peptides were identified from rat brain, and 418 proteins contained at least one predicted transmembrane domain, with false discovery rates of less than 1% for peptide identification, and at least two identified unique peptides per protein. All these results demonstrate that the BMIM BF4 method is of high potential for the large-scale identification of IMPs.",2011,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Liangliang Sun"", ids = ""2454822""); list(name = ""Dingyin Tao"", ids = ""4988355""); list(name = ""Bin Han"", ids = ""48140011""); list(name = ""Junfeng Ma"", ids = ""145608503""); list(name = ""Guijie Zhu"", ids = ""4024546""); list(name = ""Zhen Liang"", ids = ""143741147""); list(name = ""Yichu Shan"", ids = ""145609108""); list(name = ""Lihua Zhang"", ids = ""1930287""); list(name = ""Yukui Zhang"", ids = ""13584666"")",c807dbcce0cb2d1aba07327533b60f30f72d3dc6; 77fa87c4dd53bf0ecae15748d8c300a80a0b8339; a51fb6ddfd177b0cba89057fa5ec87f8ea11e753; 7456baf58a67cda94f282371ab2ccd0d7f1710fc; 41648a5400bcdc21719323ecb6868d6565a1d54b; 5a8cbc93670ae5c4ac4ff06ab8c301c72ef4d55e; 6b36c25996b671e122434de046749ef5319cfa87; af228cc46f4b85d4fbbd83487950fba6e506391b,,Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry,399,3387-3397
fea90599d8025a84a41cfef3e967041703f31b00,Identification of Candidate Genes for Calcium and Magnesium Accumulation in Brassica napus L. by Association Genetics,"Calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) are essential plant nutrients and vital for human and animal nutrition. Biofortification of crops has previously been suggested to alleviate widespread human Ca and Mg deficiencies. In this study, new candidate genes influencing the leaf accumulation of Ca and Mg were identified in young Brassica napus plants using associative transcriptomics of ionomics datasets. A total of 247 and 166 SNP markers were associated with leaf Ca and Mg concentration, respectively, after false discovery rate correction and removal of SNPs with low second allele frequency. Gene expression markers at similar positions were also associated with leaf Ca and Mg concentration, including loci on chromosomes A10 and C2, within which lie previously identified transporter genes ACA8 and MGT7. Further candidate genes were selected from seven loci and the mineral composition of whole Arabidopsis thaliana shoots were characterized from lines mutated in orthologous genes. Four and two mutant lines had reduced shoot Ca and Mg concentration, respectively, compared to wild type plants. Three of these mutations were found to have tissue specific effects; notably reduced silique Ca in all three such mutant lines.

dee9137311589d42759d956f1d711ff2eb8f323e,Locating Multiple Interacting Quantitative Trait Loci with the Zero-Inflated Generalized Poisson Regression,"We consider the problem of locating multiple interacting quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing traits measured in counts. In many applications the distribution of the count variable has a spike at zero. Zero-inflated generalized Poisson regression (ZIGPR) allows for an additional probability mass at zero and hence an improvement in the detection of significant loci. Classical model selection criteria often overestimate the QTL number. Therefore, modified versions of the Bayesian Information Criterion (mBIC and EBIC) were successfully used for QTL mapping. We apply these criteria based on ZIGPR as well as simpler models. An extensive simulation study shows their good power detecting QTL while controlling the false discovery rate. We illustrate how the inability of the Poisson distribution to account for over-dispersion leads to an overestimation of the QTL number and hence strongly discourages its application for identifying factors influencing count data. The proposed method is used to analyze the mice gallstone data of Lyons et al. (2003). Our results suggest the existence of a novel QTL on chromosome 4 interacting with another QTL previously identified on chromosome 5.

An easy to apply and noninvasive assessment for the timely detection of disease-associated complications would be of high value. We aimed to detect volatile organic compound (VOC) breath signatures of children with CF by real-time secondary electrospray ionisation high-resolution mass spectrometry (SESI-HRMS). A total of 101 children, aged 4-18â€…years (CF=52; healthy controls=49) and comparable for sex, body mass index and lung function were included in this prospective cross-sectional study. Exhaled air was analysed by a SESI-source linked to a high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Mass spectra ranging from m/z 50 to 500 were recorded. Out of 3468â€…m/z features, 171 were significantly different in children with CF (false discovery rate adjusted p-value of 0.05). The predictive ability (CF versus healthy) was assessed by using a support-vector machine classifier and showed an average accuracy (repeated cross-validation) of 72.1% (sensitivity of 77.2% and specificity of 67.7%). This is the first study to assess entire breath profiles of children with SESI-HRMS and to extract sets of VOCs that are associated with CF. We have detected a large set of exhaled molecules that are potentially related to CF, indicating that the molecular breath of children with CF is diverse and informative.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ronja Weber"", ids = ""1486575726""); list(name = ""Naemi Haas"", ids = ""1486592872""); list(name = ""Astghik Baghdasaryan"", ids = ""1486600972""); list(name = ""Tobias Bruderer"", ids = ""47574888""); list(name = ""Demet Inci"", ids = ""4736656""); list(name = ""Srdjan J.

Our objective was to discover novel genes, pathways and functions which serotonin modulates during lactation. The rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of non-neuronal serotonin is tryptophan-hydroxylase (TPH1). Therefore, we used TPH1 deficient dams (KO; serotonin deficient, n = 4) and compared them to wild-type (WT; n = 4) and rescue (RC; KO + 100 mg/kg 5-hydroxytryptophan injected daily, n = 4) dams. Mammary tissues were collected on day 10 of lactation. Total RNA extraction, amplification, library preparation and sequencing were performed following the Illumina mRNA-Seq. Overall, 97 and 204 genes (false discovery rate, FDR â‰¤ 0.01) exhibited a minimum of a 2-fold expression difference between WT vs. KO and WT vs. RC dams, respectively. Most differentially expressed genes were related to calcium homeostasis, apoptosis regulation, cell cycle, cell differentiation and proliferation, and the immune response. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology and Medical Subject Headings databases revealed the alteration of several biological processes (FDR â‰¤ 0.01) including fat cell differentiation and lipid metabolism, regulation of extracellular signal-related kinase and mitogen-activated kinase cascades, insulin resistance, nuclear transport, membrane potential regulation, and calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. The majority of the biological processes and pathways altered in the KO dams are central for mammary gland homeostasis.

e2d42a89f9ddbf7a8e8f1479a959f91c5564df51,Subnuclei atrophy in the amygdala in patients with persistent insomnia and its relation with insomnia progression and depression,"Introduction Despite high comorbidity rates of insomnia and depression, the pathways in which insomnia and depression are linked are still unclear. The high comorbidity and heightened level of arousal in both neuropsychiatric conditions calls for a study of the amygdala, which plays a crucial role in the neurobiological mechanisms underlying emotional disorders. We thus studied MR local volumentry of the amygdala in insomnia patients and controls with a longitudinal study design. Materials and methods Sixty patients presenting persistent insomnia at three time points spaced two years apart (PI, ageÂ =Â 51.13iâ€˜3/48.06, malesÂ =Â 60%) and 44 good sleepers (GS, ageÂ =Â 48.09iâ€˜3/46.47, malesÂ =Â 56.8%) were randomly selected from a larger population-based study. All participants underwent 1.5 Tesla MRI at endpoint. Vertex-wise volumetry was performed using spherical harmonic-based surface models extracted from manual delineation of the amygdala. We performed vertex-wise t -tests for group comparisons between PI and GS. Participants also completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at each visitation. We defined longitudinal change of PSQI scores as iâ€˜Â®PSQI at the 3rd PSQI at 1st time pointiâ€˜ Â¯ to measure insomnia progression. Linear regression analysis was then conducted to predict amygdalar volume, with insomnia progression and insomnia groups as independent variables. All statistical tests included age and sex, and depression as covariates. Multiple comparisons were corrected using the False Discovery Rate. Results PI presented atrophy in the laterobasal subnuclei of the amygdala (LBA) relative to GS ( p r p F Â =Â 3.2, p Conclusion This pioneer neuroimaging study reveals the presence of LBA atrophy in patients with PI, which increases in relation to progressively worsening insomnia. Extracellular recordings suggest that the neuronal activity pattern in LBA is deeply related to the sleep-wake cycle, whereas an MRI study observes that volume changes in CMA are associated with anxiety. Our findings may facilitate further clarification of the bidirectional relationship between insomnia and depression.

c0e691074e12483027aab2b25a0e41022d8d4abf,False discovery rate control incorporating phylogenetic tree increases detection power in microbiomeâ€wide multiple testing,"Motivation: Next generation sequencing technologies have enabled the study of the human microbiome through direct sequencing of microbial DNA, resulting in an enormous amount of microbiome sequencing data. One unique characteristic of microbiome data is the phylogenetic tree that relates all the bacterial species. Closely related bacterial species have a tendency to exhibit a similar relationship with the environment or disease. Thus, incorporating the phylogenetic tree information can potentially improve the detection power for microbiomeâ€wide association studies, where hundreds or thousands of tests are conducted simultaneously to identify bacterial species associated with a phenotype of interest. Despite much progress in multiple testing procedures such as false discovery rate (FDR) control, methods that take into account the phylogenetic tree are largely limited. Results: We propose a new FDR control procedure that incorporates the prior structure information and apply it to microbiome data. The proposed procedure is based on a hierarchical model, where a structureâ€based prior distribution is designed to utilize the phylogenetic tree. By borrowing information from neighboring bacterial species, we are able to improve the statistical power of detecting associated bacterial species while controlling the FDR at desired levels. When the phylogenetic tree is misâ€specified or nonâ€informative, our procedure achieves a similar power as traditional procedures that do not take into account the tree structure. We demonstrate the performance of our method through extensive simulations and real microbiome datasets. We identified far more alcoholâ€drinking associated bacterial species than traditional methods. Availability and implementation: R package StructFDR is available from CRAN.

089f998ecc03b04114cd0269286c4c4e0e58c7ab,Effect of early parenteral nutrition during paediatric critical illness on DNA methylation as a potential mediator of impaired neurocognitive development: a pre-planned secondary analysis of the PEPaNIC international randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND
Early use of parenteral nutrition in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) negatively affects development of executive functions, externalising behaviour, and visual-motor integration 2 years later, compared with omitting parenteral nutrition until PICU day 8 (late parenteral nutrition). The molecular basis of this finding is uncertain. We aimed to test the hypothesis that DNA methylation changes occur during critical illness and that early parenteral nutrition (or a specific macronutrient component hereof) contributes to these changes, which could explain its negative effects on neurocognitive development.


METHODS
This pre-planned secondary analysis of the multicentre PEPaNIC trial (2012-18) included all patients with a last PICU day blood sample (n=825, aged 0-17 years at PICU admission) who were randomly allocated (1:1) to early parenteral nutrition or late parenteral nutrition, as compared with 352 demographically matched healthy children. Investigators were masked to treatment allocation. We used the Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip to determine the genome-wide peripheral blood leukocyte DNA methylation of 865â€ˆ859 CpG sites, yielding high-quality results for 403 patients allocated to early parenteral nutrition and for 411 patients allocated to late parenteral nutrition. Applying a false discovery rate of less than 0Â·05, DNA methylation of patients on the last PICU day was compared with that of healthy children, after excluding all CpG sites differentially methylated upon PICU admission, because these reflected pre-admission conditions and altered leukocyte composition. We used bootstrapped multivariable linear and non-linear regression analyses to assess the effect of early parenteral nutrition versus late parenteral nutrition on illness-induced alterations in DNA methylation and to what extent differentially methylated CpG sites explained impaired neurocognitive development 2 years later.


FINDINGS
During PICU stay, 159 CpG sites were methylated differently in patients admitted to the PICU than in healthy children, with mean effect sizes of 2Â·6% (SD 2Â·5) up to 21Â·6% (p<0Â·02). These differentially methylated CpG sites occurred in genes involved in brain development, plasticity, and signalling; neuronal differentiation, migration, and growth; metabolism; transcriptional regulation; physical development and locomotion; and several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Early parenteral nutrition and, in particular, the dose of amino acids, independently contributed to the differential methylation of 37 (23%) of these 159 CpG sites (p=0Â·0001 to 0Â·050), which could explain the adverse effect of early parenteral nutrition on neurocognitive development at 2-year follow-up (R2 0Â·61 [SD 0Â·01]).


INTERPRETATION
Early parenteral nutrition during paediatric critical illness altered DNA methylation, which suggests a plausible molecular basis for its negative effect on long-term neurocognitive development. Early administration of amino acids, rather than of glucose or lipids, mostly explained the aberrant DNA methylation-a finding that requires further investigation.

a2fd170e6bb741079805390906dc6012ab5d73cf,Altered cord blood mitochondrial DNA content and pregnancy lead exposure in the PROGRESS cohort.,"INTRODUCTION
Lead (Pb) crosses the placenta and can cause oxidative stress, reduced fetal growth and neurological problems. The principal source of oxidative stress in human cells is mitochondria. Therefore, disruption of normal mitochondrial function during pregnancy may represent a primary mechanism behind the adverse effects of lead. We sought to assess the association of Pb exposure during pregnancy with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, a sensitive marker of mitochondrial function, in cord blood.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study comprised mother-infant pairs from the Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment and Social Stressors (PROGRESS) study, a prospective birth-cohort that enrolled 1050 pregnant women from Mexico City who were receiving prenatal care between December 2007 and July 2011. Quantitative PCR was used to calculate relative MtDNA content (mitochondrial-to-nuclear DNA ratio (mtDNA/nDNA)) in cord blood. Lead concentrations in both maternal blood (2nd and 3rd trimester and at delivery day) and in cord blood were measured by ICP-MS. Multivariable regression models adjusting for multiple confounders were fitted with 410 mother-infant pairs for whom complete data for mtDNA content, lead levels, and covariates were available.


RESULTS
Maternal blood Pb measured in the second (mean 3.79â€¯Î¼g/dL, SD 2.63; Î²â€¯=â€¯0.059, 95% CI 0.008, 0.111) and third trimester (mean 3.90â€¯Î¼g/dL; SD 2.84; Î²â€¯=â€¯0.054, 95% CI 0.002, 0.107) during pregnancy and PB in cord blood (mean 3.50â€¯Î¼g/dL, SD 2.59; Î²â€¯=â€¯0.050, 95% CI 0.004; 0.096) were associated with increased cord blood mtDNA content (mean 1.46, SD 0.44). In two-way interaction analyses, cord blood Pb marginally interacted with gestational age leading to an increase in mtDNA content for pre-term births (Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate correction; BH-FDRâ€¯=â€¯0.08).


CONCLUSION
This study shows that lead exposure in pregnancy alters mtDNA content in cord blood; therefore, alteration of mtDNA content might be a mechanism underlying the toxicity of lead.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Marco SÃ¡nchez-Guerra"", ids = ""1439016656""); list(name = ""Cheng Peng"", ids = ""3108339""); list(name = ""Letizia Trevisi"", ids = ""6788827""); list(name = ""Andres Cardenas"", ids = ""143997795""); list(name = ""Ander Wilson"", ids = ""2098356""); list(name = ""Citlalli Osorio-YÃ¡Ã±ez"", ids = ""1403571844""); list(name = ""Megan M Niedzwiecki"", ids = ""5723332""); list(name = ""Jia Zhong"", ids = ""144700606""); list(name = ""Katherine Svensson"", ids = ""48269776""); list(name = ""MarÃ­a T.

062dd0931dd01425acda77339a6be4f850ba7ae3,Modeling prior information of common genetic variants improves gene discovery for neuroticism,"Neuroticism reflects emotional instability, and is related to various mental and physical health issues. However, the majority of genetic variants associated with neuroticism remain unclear. Inconsistent genetic variants identified by different genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may be attributable to low statistical power. We proposed a novel framework to improve the power for gene discovery by incorporating prior information of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and combining two relevant existing tools, relative enrichment score (RES) and conditional false discovery rate (FDR). Here, SNP's conditional FDR was estimated given its RES based on SNP prior information including linkage disequilibrium (LD)-weighted genic annotation scores, total LD scores and heterozygosity. A known significant locus in chromosome 8p was excluded before estimating FDR due to long-range LD structure. Only one significant LD-independent SNP was detected by analyses of unconditional FDR and traditional GWAS in the discovery sample (Nâ€‰=â€‰59â€‰225), and notably four additional SNPs by conditional FDR. Three of the five SNPs, all identified by conditional FDR, were replicated (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in an independent sample (Nâ€‰=â€‰170â€‰911). These three SNPs are located in intronic regions of CADM2, LINGO2 and EP300 which have been reported to be associated with autism, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, respectively.

eecd956eabd8522764eff8eba3689f84ffc33cc0,Transcriptome Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes Related to the Growth and Development of the Jinghai Yellow Chicken,"The growth traits are important traits in chickens. Compared to white feather broiler breeds, Chinese local broiler breeds have a slow growth rate. The main genes affecting the growth traits of local chickens in China are still unclear and need to be further explored. This experiment used fast-growth and slow-growth groups of the Jinghai Yellow chicken as the research objects. Three males and three females with similar body weights were selected from the two groups at four weeks old and eight weeks old, respectively, with a total of 24 individuals selected. After slaughter, their chest muscles were taken for transcriptome sequencing. In the differentially expressed genes screening, all of the genes obtained were screened by fold change â‰¥ 2 and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. For four-week-old chickens, a total of 172 differentially expressed genes were screened in males, where there were 68 upregulated genes and 104 downregulated genes in the fast-growth group when compared with the slow-growth group. A total of 31 differentially expressed genes were screened in females, where there were 11 upregulated genes and 20 downregulated genes in the fast-growth group when compared with the slow-growth group. For eight-week-old chickens, a total of 37 differentially expressed genes were screened in males. The fast-growth group had 28 upregulated genes and 9 downregulated genes when compared with the slow-growth group. A total of 44 differentially expressed genes were screened in females. The fast-growth group had 13 upregulated genes and 31 downregulated genes when compared with the slow-growth group. Through gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, many genes were found to be related to cell proliferation and differentiation, muscle growth, and cell division such as SNCG, MCL1, ARNTL, PLPPR4, VAMP1, etc. Real-time PCR results were consistent with the RNA-Seq data and validated the findings. The results of this study will help to understand the regulation mechanism of the growth and development of Jinghai Yellow chicken and provide a theoretical basis for improving the growth rate of Chinese local chicken breeds.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Fuxiang Chen"", ids = ""49102963""); list(name = ""Pengfei Wu"", ids = ""8327139""); list(name = ""Manman Shen"", ids = ""3890745""); list(name = ""Mingliang He"", ids = ""8362584""); list(name = ""Lan Chen"", ids = ""12948531""); list(name = ""Cong Qiu"", ids = ""14008966""); list(name = ""Huiqiang Shi"", ids = ""134079839""); list(name = ""Tao Zhang"", ids = ""144124345""); list(name = ""Jiahong Wang"", ids = ""1519274692""); list(name = ""Kaizhou Xie"", ids = ""9028747""); list(name = ""Guojun Dai"", ids = ""145259797""); list(name = ""Jinyu Wang"", ids = ""49606144""); list(name = ""Genxi Zhang"", ids = ""47776687"")",46f75e120927f1abb1c9b8c38d4ec9b7dc8f6a8f; dcf1b6ba736e62790db01162df2482ca568477da,95765d29a58f9cd8cc22123a9952dd9aab5ac4ed; a719ca55f980d140dd35ca64d582eccf54f4b5ac; ea09a9fbe0e0c392c4880e4664812c091e159365; a83a4a91683ff32aa7911c5428922eab28e61dba; 2a73511369c0f0919c0c604e469fb4fdc694dfe5; 3852a695b2688e8430c682a6a0d55a73758c61d2; 35c82c0e334e5e93090696ff9cbdf8370e88aedd; 8b7c8a8cd9daa0f328ff4ad932422c8be2c90274; 6db21f1da56fd7d773a3ea82418717d4961f8f85; f8fdc88af8baacddcf0187140d47046c3d99c56a; c26b00201540dff297ddf1f2844549ae09bdfd6d; 6107fcd97bc98686f6cceace3e80c92342a89541; b6f22fdd765e8dfb27e7629dcd84f4462407220e; 9e349db4fcfc457bd7c5f733b6e42744c297f683; 4dd5845aca177809f48a36ab562823d54416dee3; dbbb8795deece47b972e507b2f0b2f0f5c10a763; e4d627407f83e5bd3fb2e8e79334e1c3c597066c; b3cd21ed399993cd8f1a0d60be67477e82426cc8; 415dd3b8ed01b25554f65098c5be50ea32155a93; 28b671554d13649be17fce1a7e7c3ecdb2a728d6; 91e85dafc4a5b9d7209a542cf8a0a1956951dee4; d913c2d12875f77133295e5448acfdadafae3fab; a7b70b2e75c813c7ac3227c5a9e8a18658e97cdd; 93507716d80b9834a1ee584b038c1be54c0790a8; 7cba05db9443fec690ebeff4f26119d91a6065a3; ba119f0ad11664b68d4c90bafc774ccb756523d6; efc5b982cc4159361027351c9133bf36f0223291; 30408b6d7b5f2c38fbcef6737559d7cf62f9c222; 8a43b989c14673f28a0f3a37353f2d3274d3ee29; 1d1ac82e26771cf16c6c59f3d0ded625efb8dc17; d0fd8f59b937734e64e224e5890c1a45d12d6209; 8e9faf73ea795ee3ffc7ad53e0005205b8bac2d4; 4c2f5b92e31e0ccc2217abb89baf17d778465c99; 0e1c68a37634ab4d3ec2125f7b7509e54be78021; 8f0f8f82d2410576ce0a8a5787a4f653ae2f8831; 7b608e9af8f317595d17fe0624dc146476d4da68; 05fd29eaee4ed2aad1c21a72968540b39c7be7e8; 313b844354a8c6d790df48bba3aa2fc82d0eb5fd; 54b933df267bd44bf99d95b2e383abf594314ab1,Genes,10,
fe33439c59381a1b01c4da7b854185a2ff2b6699,CNV-CH: A Convex Hull Based Segmentation Approach to Detect Copy Number Variations (CNV) Using Next-Generation Sequencing Data,"Copy number variation (CNV) is a form of structural alteration in the mammalian DNA sequence, which are associated with many complex neurological diseases as well as cancer. The development of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology provides us a new dimension towards detection of genomic locations with copy number variations. Here we develop an algorithm for detecting CNVs, which is based on depth of coverage data generated by NGS technology. In this work, we have used a novel way to represent the read count data as a two dimensional geometrical point. A key aspect of detecting the regions with CNVs, is to devise a proper segmentation algorithm that will distinguish the genomic locations having a significant difference in read count data. We have designed a new segmentation approach in this context, using convex hull algorithm on the geometrical representation of read count data. To our knowledge, most algorithms have used a single distribution model of read count data, but here in our approach, we have considered the read count data to follow two different distribution models independently, which adds to the robustness of detection of CNVs. In addition, our algorithm calls CNVs based on the multiple sample analysis approach resulting in a low false discovery rate with high precision.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rituparna Sinha"", ids = ""20982039""); list(name = ""Sandip Samaddar"", ids = ""49670574""); list(name = ""Rajat K.

Analysis of the entire transcriptome benefits from summarization of genes at the functional level. As a cellular response of interest not previously explored with RNA-Seq, peritoneal macrophages from mice under two conditions (control and immunologically challenged) were analyzed for gene expression differences. Quantification of individual transcripts modeled RNA-Seq read distribution and uncertainty (using a Beta Negative Binomial distribution), then tested for differential transcript expression (False Discovery Rate-adjusted p-value < 0.05). Enrichment of functional categories utilized the list of differentially expressed genes. A total of 2079 differentially expressed transcripts representing 1884 genes were detected. Enrichment of 92 categories from Gene Ontology Biological Processes and Molecular Functions, and KEGG pathways were grouped into 6 clusters. Clusters included defense and inflammatory response (Enrichment Score = 11.24) and ribosomal activity (Enrichment Score = 17.89).

ff7867fb5c4fe2ae44e7c8b116a6985338af11c2,Phenotypic effects of the circadian gene Cryptochrome 2 on cancer-related pathways,"BackgroundCircadian genes continue to gain attention as important transcriptional regulators with the potential to influence a variety of biological pathways, including many cancer-related processes. The core circadian gene cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) is essential for proper circadian timing, and is a key component of the negative arm of the circadian feedback loop. As such, aberrant expression of CRY2 may influence carcinogenic processes and thereby impact cancer susceptibility.MethodsWe silenced CRY2 in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) using small-interfering oligos (siRNA) and measured the impact of CRY2 knockdown on a number of cancer-relevant parameters. Cell cycle distribution, cell viability, and apoptotic response were measured in CRY2 knockdown (CRY2-) and normal (CRY2+) cell populations using flow cytometry in cells with and without exposure to a mutagen challenge. DNA damage accumulation was measured using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay, and damage was quantified using the Olive tail moment, which considers the amount and distance of DNA migration away from the nucleus, indicative of DNA strand breaks. Expression changes in cancer-relevant transcripts were measured by whole genome microarray. The Student's t-test was used for statistical comparisons, and P-values obtained from the microarray were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate correction, in order to obtain an adjusted Q-value for each observation.ResultsThe comet assay results indicated that upon exposure to the same dose of chemical mutagen, CRY2- cells accumulate significantly more unrepaired DNA damage than CRY2+ cells (P = 0.040), suggesting that CRY2 may be important for DNA repair. In addition, a number of transcripts with relevance for DNA damage repair displayed altered expression following CRY2 silencing. These included BCCIP (Q = 0.002), BCL2 (Q = 0.049), CCND1 (Q = 0.009), CDKN1A (Q < 0.001), GADD45A (Q = 0.002), HERC5 (Q < 0.001), MCM5 (Q = 0.042), PPP1R15A (Q < 0.001), SUMO1 (Q < 0.001), and UBA1 (Q = 0.023). However, no significant influence of CRY2 knockdown on cell cycle distributions, cell cycle checkpoints in response to mutagen challenge, or apoptotic response was detected.ConclusionsIn total, these data suggest a limited, but potentially important role for CRY2 in the regulation of DNA damage repair and the maintenance of genomic stability. Future investigations may focus on identifying the mechanisms by which CRY2 may regulate the expression of transcripts with known relevance for carcinogenesis.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Aaron E.

The image is first transformed into the wavelet domain in order to decorrelate any noise components, following which the coefficients at each resolution are standardised. Statistical tests (in a multiple hypothesis testing setting) are then carried out to find the anomalies. The power of EFDR exceeds that of standard FDR, which would carry out tests on every wavelet coefficient: EFDR choose which wavelets to test based on a criterion described in Shen et al. (2002).

12099c28a3ad1ea3081f2644c2ca5ca66dcf9326,Smoking is Associated to DNA Methylation in Atherosclerotic Carotid Lesions,"Background: Tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic disease and has been associated with DNA methylation (DNAm) changes in blood cells. However, whether smoking influences DNAm in the diseased vascular wall is unknown but may prove crucial in understanding the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. In this study, we associated current tobacco smoking to epigenome-wide DNAm in atherosclerotic plaques from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Methods: DNAm at commonly methylated sites (cytosine-guanine nucleotide pairs separated by a phospho-group [CpGs]) was assessed in atherosclerotic plaque samples and peripheral blood samples from 485 carotid endarterectomy patients. We tested the association of current tobacco smoking with DNAm corrected for age and sex. To control for bias and inflation because of cellular heterogeneity, we applied a Bayesian method to estimate an empirical null distribution as implemented by the R package bacon. Replication of the smoking-associated methylated CpGs in atherosclerotic plaques was executed in the second sample of 190 carotid endarterectomy patients, and results were meta-analyzed using a fixed-effects model. Results: Tobacco smoking was significantly associated to differential DNAm in atherosclerotic lesions of 4 CpGs (false discovery rate <0.05) mapped to 2 different genes (AHRR, ITPK1) and 17 CpGs mapped to 8 genes and RNAs in blood. The strongest associations were found for CpGs mapped to the gene AHRR, a repressor of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor transcription factor involved in xenobiotic detoxification. One of these methylated CpGs were found to be regulated by local genetic variation. Conclusions: The risk factor tobacco smoking associates with DNAm at multiple loci in carotid atherosclerotic lesions. These observations support further investigation of the relationship between risk factors and epigenetic regulation in atherosclerotic disease.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Marten A.

958af62fbcb24e6f128abacd0f6fee81c02f4db7,False Discovery Rate Control via Debiased Lasso,"We consider the problem of variable selection in high-dimensional statistical models where the goal is to report a set of variables, out of many predictors $X_1, \dotsc, X_p$, that are relevant to a response of interest. For linear high-dimensional model, where the number of parameters exceeds the number of samples $(p>n)$, we propose a procedure for variables selection and prove that it controls the \emph{directional} false discovery rate (FDR) below a pre-assigned significance level $q\in [0,1]$. We further analyze the statistical power of our framework and show that for designs with subgaussian rows and a common precision matrix $\Omega\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times p}$, if the minimum nonzero parameter $\theta_{\min}$ satisfies $$\sqrt{n} \theta_{\min} - \sigma \sqrt{2(\max_{i\in [p]}\Omega_{ii})\log\left(\frac{2p}{qs_0}\right)} \to \infty\,,$$ then this procedure achieves asymptotic power one. 
Our framework is built upon the debiasing approach and assumes the standard condition $s_0 = o(\sqrt{n}/(\log p)^2)$, where $s_0$ indicates the number of true positives among the $p$ features. Notably, this framework achieves exact directional FDR control without any assumption on the amplitude of unknown regression parameters, and does not require any knowledge of the distribution of covariates or the noise level.

191027b362a4dc39f30fddca221adca697eec7fd,Comparison between Glioblastoma and Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma Using MR Image-based Texture Analysis,"PURPOSE
To elucidate differences between glioblastoma (GBM) and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) with MR image-based texture features.


METHODS
This was an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved retrospective study. Consecutive, pathologically proven, initially treated 44 patients with GBM and 16 patients with PCNSL were enrolled. We calculated a total of 67 image texture features on the largest contrast-enhancing lesion in each patient on post-contrast T1-weighted images. Texture analyses included first-order features (histogram) and second-order features calculated with gray level co-occurrence matrix, gray level run length matrix (GLRLM), gray level size zone matrix, and multiple gray level size zone matrix. All texture features were measured by two neuroradiologists independently and the intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated. Reproducible features with the intraclass correlation coefficients of greater than 0.7 were used for hierarchical clustering between the cases and the features along with unpaired t statistics-based comparisons under the control of false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to find the predominant features in evaluating the differences between GBM and PCNSL.


RESULTS
Twenty-one out of the 67 features satisfied the acceptable intraclass correlation coefficient and the FDR constraints. PCA suggested first-order entropy, median, GLRLM-based run length non-uniformity, and run percentage as the distinguished features. Compared with PCNSL, run percentage and median were significantly lower, and entropy and run length non-uniformity were significantly higher in GBM.


CONCLUSIONS
Among MR image-based textures, first-order entropy, median, GLRLM-based run length non-uniformity, and run percentage are considered to enhance differences between GBM and PCNSL.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Akira Kunimatsu"", ids = ""3134060""); list(name = ""Natsuko Kunimatsu"", ids = ""2954589""); list(name = ""Kouhei Kamiya"", ids = ""2987661""); list(name = ""Takeyuki Watadani"", ids = ""3709250""); list(name = ""Harushi Mori"", ids = ""1709112""); list(name = ""Osamu Abe"", ids = ""143815291"")",ee5a1dad9f5377d84a8cd93280ce159cfac98dae; 77375ea77062e9eedb534c3e5ae57d8ffda86dc0; 9c0ca5ec676ff1294c762dfd2df2417c188ffb6d; f2eaf2c19752737d945db27095a3ced745804fce; 6436907b7bd9f61c6827f8fcbe0dc80398cc2206; 8028687297926668fe50b21f4b21e2da296f1ab6; ba9d0f165134dbedabd38a24933389cbdf9160f3; c438def613675aae38ce5f49764055d3ceebdd40; 4955335096c038f2cf39fdb4cc2bc79edaf363f9; bdb545971670879821fad256363e066d2d8bdbb6,4834bdb470a3ff097cb1f6712527a5077b62e4f1; e0475a8fa6fb1d888989850e7d991c2a21bf70ef; dcd99d49af33bd14e9e0750bcf854e7b306c808a; 89e7bd3d984888208b61a670409602ac72d72092; f0e92ab85fc4f761ae553308d529365dc6dbbf2b; c1027d074a37bf55181c0fc6ea9e8fe2ae80b58d; a74be6105fde018be2c2ee2388b79e64f3dfac8a; 8ab2c11ac0a620b83a91be9e7e8bd0b1b0de0f98; 1efd36ed78512ee1a36602cb4564a0c04bf57aae; 21d4afdd0dc0ccfdc5a692177e71fe9ebc7aeb2b; 93c621f8a17a3853a51e3fb9929da50233f9f058; 9cc8dac76abeab46a30a7efec1740322d235581e; 73d491704a20ac0db6c26cb9715b2f6bc165c9cd; e4b17209bfffb5809810c87fbb2079cb9263f7d0; 934a2055975c7953d3587acd2d91827660d8a180; 5cbb9f6cb079844282efebb2855e1e43276b40ee; 18292001f06b3fe7fe622df696351d8ceff793e2; c42d75cec7a302573747a01a343ddd07b676f434; 582a3d25f2358a1772573626ea09ae3a9d87d17e; 5bd5fb68287c699fab3c913a1d6a4cfd6fc36cb1; 8cd654ce970f0187c5ecdd0542674382821f91d0; 75db415c33edd8d8827d885fca9a5550ddf14e70; 8bb0627e2d2dc80d3d45cc73a5cbbb7ab296de08,Magnetic Resonance in Medical Sciences,17,50 - 57
7da52b7568efb7d5fdffc23b4d4cb5c49ce27ae1,Concave 1-norm group selection.,"Grouping structures arise naturally in many high-dimensional problems. Incorporation of such information can improve model fitting and variable selection. Existing group selection methods, such as the group Lasso, require correct membership. However, in practice it can be difficult to correctly specify group membership of all variables. Thus, it is important to develop group selection methods that are robust against group mis-specification. Also, it is desirable to select groups as well as individual variables in many applications. We propose a class of concave [Formula: see text]-norm group penalties that is robust to grouping structure and can perform bi-level selection. A coordinate descent algorithm is developed to calculate solutions of the proposed group selection method. Theoretical convergence of the algorithm is proved under certain regularity conditions. Comparison with other methods suggests the proposed method is the most robust approach under membership mis-specification. Simulation studies and real data application indicate that the [Formula: see text]-norm concave group selection approach achieves better control of false discovery rates. An R package grppenalty implementing the proposed method is available at CRAN.",2015,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dingfeng Jiang"", ids = ""48219931""); list(name = ""Jian Huang"", ids = ""1732234"")",ff92100806b8cae0fa92ae4acb90bbe3d3f774b7; 10dc14f46f3e206dab2db027c13cdf26a83acf3b,,Biostatistics,16 2,"

3000799a703633feed1899721a52ddc9743b81c2,The clinical value of the delta finger to palm distance in systemic sclerosis.,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a collagen-vascular disorder characterized by fibrosis and vasculopathy. Delta finger to palm distance (delta FTP) is an index measuring the distance between the tip of the third finger to the distal palmar crease in the flexed and extended position. The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical value of delta FTP and to assess the correlation of delta FTP with modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) and forced vital capacity (FVC) over the 12-month follow-up. This prospective longitudinal study began with 50 participants who were followed for twelve months. Lowess smoothing and linear regression were applied to detect and assess the relationship between delta FTP and mRSS. p-values were adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg method (BHM) as a control for false discovery rate. Delta FTP was lower among patients with higher disease duration (p-valueadj: 0.008), diffuse cutaneous SSc (p-valueadj: 0.006), digital ulcers (p-valueadj: 0.003), telangiectasia (p-valueadj: 0.006) and dysphagia (p-valueadj: 0.036). The mRSS has a significant negative linear effect on the delta FTP at the baseline and the end of the follow-up (r: -0.31 and -0.40, respectively). Moreover, changes of mRSS and delta FTP showed a negative linear association over time (r: -0.22). These linear effects remained significant after regrouping the patients based on their SSc subtype. Delta FTP and FVC were not correlated either at the baseline or at the end. It seems that the delta FTP can be a valuable clinical index, supported by its correlated changes with mRSS and other SSc clinical manifestations over the one-year follow-up.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ali Javinani"", ids = ""13305736""); list(name = ""Shayan Mostafaei"", ids = ""1387465491""); list(name = ""Farhad Gharibdoost"", ids = ""4477509""); list(name = ""Ahmadreza Jamshidi"", ids = ""153467509""); list(name = ""R Atef Yekta"", ids = ""1633520034""); list(name = ""T Kiani Fard"", ids = ""1633545613""); list(name = ""Zahra Tamartash"", ids = ""1413807996""); list(name = ""Fatemeh Gorgani"", ids = ""6614875""); list(name = ""Mona Mirbeyk"", ids = ""1413821107""); list(name = ""Mahdi Mahmoudi"", ids = ""143779175""); list(name = ""Kourosh Sadeghi"", ids = ""152549044""); list(name = ""Hoda Kavosi"", ids = ""14680225"")",,,Reumatismo,72 1,"

Previous studies have associated fine particulate (PM2.5) exposure with changes in gene-specific DNA methylation. However, the evidence was still limited and inconsistent in genome-wide DNA methylation.


OBJECTIVE
To examine the impact of short-term PM2.5 exposure on genome-wide DNA methylation.


METHODS
We designed a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial among 36 healthy young adults in Shanghai, China. A two-stage intervention with alternative use of real and sham air purifiers in dormitory rooms for consecutive 9â€¯days were conducted to create natural low and high exposure scenarios of PM2.5. Blood genome-wide DNA methylation was analyzed using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip (850k). Mixed-effect models were used to evaluate the impacts of changes in PM2.5 levels on genome-wide DNA methylation.


RESULTS
There was a drastic contrast for PM2.5 exposure levels in the two scenarios (24-h averages: 53.1 and 24.3â€¯Î¼g/m3). Between the high and low exposure groups, methylation levels were changed significantly with a false discovery rateâ€¯<â€¯0.01 at 49 CpG loci, of which 31 CpG sites were annotated to the specific genes. DNA methylation of these annotated genes were elevated in response to increased PM2.5 exposure, which were implicated in insulin resistance, glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, platelet activation, and cell survival and apoptosis.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results provided novel biological pathways linking ambient PM2.5 exposure to systemic adverse response through variations in DNA methylation and reinforced the hypothesized role of epigenetics in the development of cardiometabolic diseases induced by PM2.5 exposure.",2018,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Huichu Li"", ids = ""13032147""); list(name = ""Renjie Chen"", ids = ""145890722""); list(name = ""Jing Cai"", ids = ""50490194""); list(name = ""Xiao Cui"", ids = ""144278291""); list(name = ""Nan Huang"", ids = ""144336379""); list(name = ""Haidong Kan"", ids = ""2136813"")",8271832a98bb4b6aaeb2c9d0c9614ecbc8090459; a7ac31e2d6172afeddaf89df9a114e6f19a5615d; 20c28351304bbdc91533c9ae6cfb7fa095a271a3,,Environment international,120,"

Variable selection was conducted by stepwise Akaike information criterion or least angle regression and both methods led to the same final model. Significant predictors (where P values were adjusted for false discovery rate) included type of blood sample [whole blood (WB) vs. plasma-depleted WB; P < 0.001] used for folate analysis, gender (P < 0.001), and SNP in genes SPTLC1 (rs11790991; P = 0.040), CRBP2 (rs2118981; P < 0.001), BHMT (rs3733890; P = 0.019), and CETP (rs5882; P = 0.017).

The relation of nHcy concentrations with the significant SNP (SPTLC1, BHMT, CETP, CRBP2, MTHFR, and SCARB1) is of interest, especially because we surveyed the main and interaction effects in healthy adults, but it is an important area for future study.

5c6496c325375e75cfe77579b71ff5e15bbaadf9,Genetic polymorphisms in host antiviral genes: Associations with humoral and cellular immunity to measles vaccine,"
 Abstract
 
 Host antiviral genes are important regulators of antiviral immunity and plausible genetic determinants of immune response heterogeneity after vaccination. We genotyped and analyzed 307 common candidate tagSNPs from 12 antiviral genes in a cohort of 745 schoolchildren immunized with two doses of measlesâ€“mumpsâ€“rubella (MMR) vaccine. Associations between SNPs/haplotypes and measles virus-specific immune outcomes were assessed using linear regression methodologies in Caucasians and African-Americans.
 Genetic variants within the DDX58/RIG-I gene, including a coding polymorphism (rs3205166/Val800Val), were associated as single-SNPs (p
 â‰¤0.017; although these SNPs did not remain significant after correction for false discovery rate/FDR) and in haplotype-level analysis, with measles-specific antibody variations in Caucasians (haplotype allele p-value=0.021; haplotype global p-value=0.076). Four DDX58 polymorphisms, in high LD, demonstrated also associations (after correction for FDR) with variations in both measles-specific IFN-Î³ and IL-2 secretion in Caucasians (p
 â‰¤0.001, q
 =0.193). Two intronic OAS1 polymorphisms, including the functional OAS1 SNP rs10774671 (p
 =0.003), demonstrated evidence of association with a significant allele-dose-related increase in neutralizing antibody levels in African-Americans. Genotype and haplotype-level associations demonstrated the role of ADAR genetic variants, including a non-synonymous SNP (rs2229857/Arg384Lys; p
 =0.01), in regulating measles virus-specific IFN-Î³ Elispot responses in Caucasians (haplotype global p-value=0.017). After correction for FDR, 15 single-SNP associations (11 SNPs in Caucasians and 4 SNPs in African-Americans) still remained significant at the q-value<0.20.
 In conclusion, our findings strongly point to genetic variants/genes, involved in antiviral sensing and antiviral control, as critical determinants, differentially modulating the adaptive immune responses to live attenuated measles vaccine in Caucasians and African-Americans.

e9f76d056bbc5b47bcd0d0b06b8e6549dfe7c634,VDAC1 and prognosis in surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer.,"7029 Background: The likelihood of relapse following surgery for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is determined by clinical and genetic factors. Metabolic status of tumors may influence outcome. The voltage dependent anion channel type 1 (VDAC1), regulates mitochondrial ATP/ADP exchange and was explored in relation to survival following surgical resection. Methods: A NSCLC gene expression library curated from publically available data (NCBI GEO), comprised ten independent datasets (N=618 samples). The VDAC1 expression distribution was stratified into tertiles, prior to logrank univariate and Cox multivariate survival analyses. Analysis was performed using R and TMev. Across all the datasets, p values were corrected for multiple comparisons by calculating q values based on the method of false discovery rates. Genes that were determined as significant in at least 50% of the datasets were retained to generate a meta-signature comprising consistently differentially expressed genes correlated with VDAC1.

3460534612a59d2d7f0a5dcc404ed21d4778c11b,Reduced brain gray matter concentration in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.,"STUDY OBJECTIVES
To investigate differences in brain gray matter concentrations or volumes in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) and healthy volunteers.


DESIGNS
Optimized voxel-based morphometry, an automated processing technique for MRI, was used to characterize structural differences in gray matter in newly diagnosed male patients.


SETTING
University hospital.


PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS
The study consisted of 36 male OSA and 31 non-apneic male healthy volunteers matched for age (mean age, 44.8 years).


INTERVENTIONS
Using the t-test, gray matter differences were identified. The statistical significance level was set to a false discovery rate P < 0.05 with an extent threshold of k(E) > 200 voxels.


MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS
The mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of patients was 52.5/h. On visual inspection of MRI, no structural abnormalities were observed. Compared to healthy volunteers, the gray matter concentrations of OSA patients were significantly decreased in the left gyrus rectus, bilateral superior frontal gyri, left precentral gyrus, bilateral frontomarginal gyri, bilateral anterior cingulate gyri, right insular gyrus, bilateral caudate nuclei, bilateral thalami, bilateral amygdalo-hippocampi, bilateral inferior temporal gyri, and bilateral quadrangular and biventer lobules in the cerebellum (false discovery rate P < 0.05).

497ec7a2845d625abc483bfde3ad362922187280,Genetic overlap between multiple sclerosis and several cardiovascular disease risk factors,"Background: Epidemiological findings suggest a relationship between multiple sclerosis (MS) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, although the nature of this relationship is not well understood. Objective: We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to identify shared genetic factors (pleiotropy) between MS and CVD risk factors. Methods: Using summary statistics from a large, recent GWAS (total nâ€‰>â€‰250,000 individuals), we investigated overlap in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with MS and a number of CVD risk factors including triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure, and C-reactive protein level. Results and conclusion: Using conditional enrichment plots, we found 30-fold enrichment of MS SNPs for different levels of association with LDL and TG SNPs, with a corresponding reduction in conditional false discovery rate (FDR). We identified 133 pleiotropic loci outside the extended major histocompatibility complex with conditional FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.01, of which 65 are novel. These pleiotropic loci were located on 21 different chromosomes. Our findings point to overlapping pathobiology between clinically diagnosed MS and cardiovascular risk factors and identify novel common variants associated with increased MS risk.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yunpeng Wang"", ids = ""40566190""); list(name = ""Steffan D Bos"", ids = ""50783820""); list(name = ""Hanne F.

782b5102432d341384d5a58590ee1ad30bf0cbc5,The Power of Batching in Multiple Hypothesis Testing,"One important partition of algorithms for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple testing is into offline and online algorithms. The first generally achieve significantly higher power of discovery, while the latter allow making decisions sequentially as well as adaptively formulating hypotheses based on past observations. Using existing methodology, it is unclear how one could trade off the benefits of these two broad families of algorithms, all the while preserving their formal FDR guarantees. To this end, we introduce $\text{Batch}_{\text{BH}}$ and $\text{Batch}_{\text{St-BH}}$, algorithms for controlling the FDR when a possibly infinite sequence of batches of hypotheses is tested by repeated application of one of the most widely used offline algorithms, the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method or Storey's improvement of the BH method. We show that our algorithms interpolate between existing online and offline methodology, thus trading off the best of both worlds.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Tijana Zrnic"", ids = ""7830023""); list(name = ""Daniel L.

7c4ca54d3daa93a2ad97cde898ab2dfcf28fe1d5,KRAKEN results: taxonomic abundance tables and discriminant analysis,"Tables of estimated abundances of taxa present in metagenomic samples (including human) using Kraken (Wood & Salzberg, Genome Biology, 2013), based on k-mer identity with a reference database extracted from a large set of complete genomes. Kraken assigns reads to all taxonomic levels in a cumulative manner, and relative abundance of taxa can be computed using the ratio of read counts at one specific level over the total. Read counts were computed 1) with a conservative filter on read confidence scores, i.e. keeping only reads with more than 20% k-mers assigned to congruent taxa (using kraken-filter executable with option â€œ--thresh 0.20â€); and 2) in a sensitive mode, i.e. without confidence score filtering. Relative abundances were computed at the species and genus level. Distribution of relative abundances per sample (from sensitive mode) showed significant bias relative to sequencing depth for values under 10-12, with low-depth samples being depleted in rare species (Fig. S1), so the species relative abundance dataset was truncated to species with values above 10-12, decreasing the number of represented species from 8,226 to 5,323. We used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) (Segata et al., 2011) to detect taxa that significantly differentiate groups of samples based on their subsistence strategy (accounting for the underlying grouping by population). We then used a simple LDA, as implemented in the ade4 R package (Dufour & Dray, 2007), to identify the species that specifically differentiate microbiomes along the human lifestyle gradient opposing HGs to Western controls (WCs); significance was assessed with pairwise t-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate [FDR] correction procedure for multiple testing) and ANCOM test (with low stringency multiple testing correction, option â€˜multcorr=2â€™). Figures : Taxa discriminating between subsistence strategies under conservative and sensitive settings, respectively. WGS-based estimates of taxonomic abundance (Kraken classification from reads with assignment confidence over 20% or unfiltered reads, respectively) were used to find (A) the best discriminant taxa based on a three-way comparison of the HG, TF and WC groups with the LEfSe algorithm (score over 3), and (B) the best discriminant species between HG and WC groups based on a simple LDA.

27cad217b6d4c58de61e0a6d69f0abdce2eabdbe,Variance model selection with application to joint analysis of multiple microarray datasets under false discovery rate control,"We study the problem of selecting homogeneous variance models vs. heterogeneous variance models in the context of joint analysis of multiple microarray datasets. We provide a modified multiresponse permutation procedure (MRPP), modified cross-validation procedures, and the right AICc (corrected Akaikeâ€™s information criterion) for choosing a variance model. In a simple univariate setting, our modified MRPP outperforms commonly used competitors. For microarray data analysis, we suggest using the sum of genespecific selection criteria to choose one best gene-specific model for use with all genes. Through realistic simulations based on three real microarray studies, we evaluated the proposed methods and found that using the correct model does not necessarily provide the best separation between differentially and equivalently expressed genes, but it does control false discovery rates (FDR) at desired levels. A hybrid procedure to decouple FDR control and differential expression detection is recommended.",2010,Computer Science,"list(name = ""N. Bacciu"", ids = ""50156498""); list(name = ""Jack C. M.

29f1fd2fb4cc2832fdee577f87a27f709febbaf7,Alternative Splicing of RNA Triplets Is Often Regulated and Accelerates Proteome Evolution,"Thousands of human genes contain introns ending in NAGNAG (N any nucleotide), where both NAGs can function as 3' splice sites, yielding isoforms that differ by inclusion/exclusion of three bases. However, few models exist for how such splicing might be regulated, and some studies have concluded that NAGNAG splicing is purely stochastic and nonfunctional. Here, we used deep RNA-Seq data from 16 human and eight mouse tissues to analyze the regulation and evolution of NAGNAG splicing. Using both biological and technical replicates to estimate false discovery rates, we estimate that at least 25% of alternatively spliced NAGNAGs undergo tissue-specific regulation in mammals, and alternative splicing of strongly tissue-specific NAGNAGs was 10 times as likely to be conserved between species as was splicing of non-tissue-specific events, implying selective maintenance. Preferential use of the distal NAG was associated with distinct sequence features, including a more distal location of the branch point and presence of a pyrimidine immediately before the first NAG, and alteration of these features in a splicing reporter shifted splicing away from the distal site. Strikingly, alignments of orthologous exons revealed a âˆ¼15-fold increase in the frequency of three base pair gaps at 3' splice sites relative to nearby exon positions in both mammals and in Drosophila. Alternative splicing of NAGNAGs in human was associated with dramatically increased frequency of exon length changes at orthologous exon boundaries in rodents, and a model involving point mutations that create, destroy, or alter NAGNAGs can explain both the increased frequency and biased codon composition of gained/lost sequence observed at the beginnings of exons. This study shows that NAGNAG alternative splicing generates widespread differences between the proteomes of mammalian tissues, and suggests that the evolutionary trajectories of mammalian proteins are strongly biased by the locations and phases of the introns that interrupt coding sequences.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Robert K.

32c8592d1001e1ba6257806bc2b9eb1cfde60df9,Expression data dnalysis and regulatory network inference by means of correlation patterns,"With the advance of high-throughput techniques, the amount of available data in the bio-molecular field is rapidly growing. It is now possible to measure genome-wide aspects of an entire biological system as a whole. 
Correlations that emerge due to internal dependency structures of these systems entail the formation of characteristic patterns in the corresponding data. The extraction of these patterns has become an integral part of computational biology. 
By triggering perturbations and interventions it is possible to induce an alteration of patterns, which may help to derive the dependency structures present in the system. In particular, differential expression experiments may yield alternate patterns that we can use to approximate the actual interplay of regulatory proteins and genetic elements, namely, the regulatory network of a cell. 
 
In this work, we examine the detection of correlation patterns from bio-molecular data and we evaluate their applicability in terms of protein contact prediction, experimental artifact removal, the discovery of unexpected expression patterns and genome-scale inference of regulatory networks. 
 
Correlation patterns are not limited to expression data. Their analysis in the context of conserved interfaces among proteins is useful to estimate whether these may have co-evolved. Patterns that hint on correlated mutations would then occur in the associated protein sequences as well. We employ a conceptually simple sampling strategy to decide whether or not two pathway elements share a conserved interface and are thus likely to be in physical contact. We successfully apply our method to a system of ABC-transporters and two-component systems from the phylum of Firmicute bacteria. 
 
For spatially resolved gene expression data like microarrays, the detection of artifacts, as opposed to noise, corresponds to the extraction of localized patterns that resemble outliers in a given region. We develop a method to detect and remove such artifacts using a sliding-window approach. Our method is very accurate and it is shown to adapt to other platforms like custom arrays as well. 
Further, we developed Padesco as a way to reveal unexpected expression patterns. We extract frequent and recurring patterns that are conserved across many experiments. For a specific experiment, we predict whether a gene deviates from its expected behaviour. We show that Padesco is an effective approach for selecting promising candidates from differential expression experiments. 
 
In Chapter 5, we then focus on the inference of genome-scale regulatory networks from expression data. Here, correlation patterns have proven useful for the data-driven estimation of regulatory interactions. We show that, for reliable eukaryotic network inference, the integration of prior networks is essential. We reveal that this integration leads to an over-estimate of network-wide quality estimates and suggest a corrective procedure, CoRe, to counterbalance this effect. CoRe drastically improves the false discovery rate of the originally predicted networks. We further suggest a consensus approach in combination with an extended set of topological features to obtain a more accurate estimate of the eukaryotic regulatory network for yeast. 
 
In the course of this work we show how correlation patterns can be detected and how they can be applied for various problem settings in computational molecular biology. We develop and discuss competitive approaches for the prediction of protein contacts, artifact repair, differential expression analysis, and network inference and show their applicability in practical setups.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Tobias Petri"", ids = ""70590076"")",,,,,

Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) pursues this aim at proteome-wide scale by inferring target engagement from its effects on temperature-dependent protein denaturation. However, a key challenge of TPP is the statistical analysis of the measured melting curves with controlled false discovery rates at high proteome coverage and detection power. We present non-parametric analysis of response curves (NPARC), a statistical method for TPP based on functional data analysis and nonlinear regression. We evaluate NPARC on five independent TPP datasets and observe that it is able to detect subtle changes in any region of the melting curves, reliably detects the known targets, and outperforms a melting point-centric, single-parameter fitting approach in terms of specificity and sensitivity. NPARC can be combined with established analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistics and enables flexible, factorial experimental designs and replication levels. To facilitate access to a wide range of users, a freely available software implementation of NPARC is provided.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dorothee Childs"", ids = ""49861113""); list(name = ""Karsten Bach"", ids = ""8197595""); list(name = ""Holger Franken"", ids = ""46654455""); list(name = ""Simon Anders"", ids = ""1922254""); list(name = ""Nils Kurzawa"", ids = ""5461780""); list(name = ""Marcus Bantscheff"", ids = ""2707349""); list(name = ""Mikhail M Savitski"", ids = ""46945863""); list(name = ""Wolfgang Huber"", ids = ""144493753"")",1e33326d1fa761be6ab9efbbfc0c739d5dc17247; 055684ba47919be5393580a3f0729acf2b7f54a9,,Molecular & Cellular Proteomics : MCP,18,2506 - 2515

We hypothesized that such gene variants may also be associated with mortality after cerebral ischemia of arterial origin because of an increased risk of fatal vascular events. Methods: We performed a case-control study in 316 long-term survivors and 887 patients with recent cerebral ischemia of arterial origin. False discovery rate q values were calculated to account for multiple testing. The mean duration between occurrence of cerebral ischemia and DNA collection was 16.8 years in long-term survivors and 3.2 months in recent patients. Results: Two of 23 variants were associated with mortality: the 95Arg allele of the coagulation factor XIII subunit B (F13B) His95Arg variant (OR, 1.5 for Arg/Arg and His/Arg vs. His/His genotype; 95% CI, 1.1â€“2.2, q = 0.29) and the 4G allele of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) 4G/5G variant (OR, 1.5 for 4G/4G and 5G/4G vs. 5G/5G genotype; 95% CI, 1.1â€“2.0, q = 0.29). Both associations disappeared after accounting for multiple testing. Data analysis restricted to recently deceased patients (n = 133) yielded similar results. Conclusions: In this hospital-based study none of 23 prothrombotic gene variants were associated with long-term mortality after cerebral ischemia of arterial origin. Prothrombotic gene variants do not appear to play an important role in long-term mortality after cerebral ischemia.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""D Martijn O Pruissen"", ids = ""8005619""); list(name = ""Frits R Rosendaal"", ids = ""15700941""); list(name = ""Catharina J.

In common exploratory microarray experiments, most genes are not expected to be differentially expressed. The family-wise error (FWE) rate and false discovery rate (FDR) are two common approaches used to account for multiple hypothesis tests to identify differentially expressed genes. When the number of hypotheses is very large and some null hypotheses are expected to be true, the power of an FWE or FDR procedure can be improved if the number of null hypotheses is known. The mean of differences (MD) of ranked p-values has been proposed to estimate the number of true null hypotheses under the independence model. This article proposes to incorporate the MD estimate into an FWE or FDR approach for gene identification. Simulation results show that the procedure appears to control the FWE and FDR well at the FWE=0.05 and FDR=0.05 significant levels; it exceeds the nominal level for FDR=0.01 when the null hypotheses are highly correlated, a correlation of 0.941.

7d31e912e7e31594395770186b28f442ac38058e,Whole-genome sequencing to understand the genetic architecture of common gene expression and biomarker phenotypes,"Initial results from sequencing studies suggest that there are relatively few low-frequency (<5%) variants associated with large effects on common phenotypes. We performed low-pass whole-genome sequencing in 680 individuals from the InCHIANTI study to test two primary hypotheses: (i) that sequencing would detect single low-frequency-large effect variants that explained similar amounts of phenotypic variance as single common variants, and (ii) that some common variant associations could be explained by low-frequency variants. We tested two sets of disease-related common phenotypes for which we had statistical power to detect large numbers of common variant-common phenotype associations-11 132 cis-gene expression traits in 450 individuals and 93 circulating biomarkers in all 680 individuals. From a total of 11 657 229 high-quality variants of which 6 129 221 and 5 528 008 were common and low frequency (<5%), respectively, low frequency-large effect associations comprised 7% of detectable cis-gene expression traits [89 of 1314 cis-eQTLs at P < 1 Ã— 10(-06) (false discovery rate âˆ¼5%)] and one of eight biomarker associations at P < 8 Ã— 10(-10). Very few (30 of 1232; 2%) common variant associations were fully explained by low-frequency variants. Our data show that whole-genome sequencing can identify low-frequency variants undetected by genotyping based approaches when sample sizes are sufficiently large to detect substantial numbers of common variant associations, and that common variant associations are rarely explained by single low-frequency variants of large effect.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrew R Wood"", ids = ""8493079""); list(name = ""Marcus A Tuke"", ids = ""3773703""); list(name = ""M.

05b0d71e861f971e6c6d25af4fb908e0f0c174fe,Multiple Testing Procedures and Applications to Genomics,"The Bioconductor R package multtest implements widely applicable resampling-based single-step and stepwise multiple testing procedures (MTP) for controlling a broad class of Type I error rates, in testing problems involving general data generating distributions (with arbitrary dependence structures among variables), null hypotheses, and test statistics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The current version of multtest provides MTPs for null hypotheses concerning means, differences in means, and regression parameters in linear and Cox proportional hazards models. Both bootstrap and permutation estimators of the test statistics (tor F -statistics) null distribution are available. Procedures are provided to control Type I error rates defined as tail probabilities and expected values of arbitrary functions of the numbers of Type I errors, Vn, and rejected hypotheses, Rn. These error rates include: the generalized family-wise error rate, gFWER(k) = Pr(Vn > k), or chance of at least (k+1) false positives (the special case k = 0 corresponds to the usual family-wise error rate, FWER); tail probabilities TPPFP (q) = Pr(Vn/Rn > q) for the proportion of false positives among the rejected hypotheses; the false discovery rate, FDR = E[Vn/Rn]. Single-step and step-down common-cut-off (maxT) and common-quantile (minP) procedures, that take into account the joint distribution of the test statistics, are implemented to control the FWER. In addition, augmentation procedures are provided to control the gFWER, TPPFP, and FDR, based on any initial FWER-controlling procedure. The results of a multiple testing procedure are summarized using rejection regions for the test statistics, confidence regions for the parameters of interest, and adjusted p-values. The modular design of the multtest package allows interested users to readily extend the packageâ€™s functionality, ii S. Pollard, Sandrine Dudoit, Mark J. van der Laan by inserting additional functions for test statistics and testing procedures.

53b56e066120ad55e4f70a41cf74caa9b36db568,"Air pollution, particulate matter composition and methylation-based biologic age.","BACKGROUND
Epigenetic age, as defined by DNA methylation, may be influenced by air pollution exposure.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the relationship between NO2, particulate matter (PM), PM components and accelerated epigenetic age.


METHODS
In a sample of non-Hispanic white women living in the contiguous U.S. (nâ€¯=â€¯2747), we estimated residential exposure to PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 using a model incorporating land-use regression and kriging. Predictive k-means was used to assign participants to clusters representing different PM2.5 component profiles. We measured DNA methylation (DNAm) in blood using the Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and calculated DNAm age using the Hannum, Horvath and Levine epigenetic clocks. Age acceleration was defined based on residuals after regressing DNAm age on chronological age. We estimated associations between interquartile range (IQR) increases in pollutants and age acceleration using linear regression. For PM2.5, we stratified by cluster membership. We examined epigenome-wide associations using robust linear regression models corrected with false discovery rate q-values.


RESULTS
NO2 was inversely associated with age acceleration using the Hannum clock (Î²â€¯=â€¯-0.24, 95% CI: -0.47, -0.02). No associations were observed for PM10. For PM2.5, the association with age acceleration varied by PM2.5 component cluster. For example, with the Levine clock, an IQR increase in PM2.5 was associated with an over 6-year age acceleration in a cluster that has relatively high fractions of crustal elements relative to overall PM2.5 (Î²â€¯=â€¯6.57, 95% CI: 2.68, 10.47), and an almost 2-year acceleration in a cluster characterized by relatively low sulfur fractions (Î²â€¯=â€¯1.88, 95% CI: 0.51, 3.25). In a cluster distinguished by lower relative nitrate concentrations, PM2.5 was inversely associated with age acceleration (Î²â€¯=â€¯-1.33, 95% CI: -2.43, -0.23). Across the epigenome, NO2 was associated with methylation at 2 CpG sites.


CONCLUSION
Air pollution was associated with epigenetic age, a marker of mortality and disease risk, among certain PM2.5 component profiles.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexandra J White"", ids = ""6874085""); list(name = ""Jacob K.

c2228f493a4dc5ea84d9b96c14428bd42403e2f0,Abstract 884: Circulating microRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. In 2008, 1.61 million new cases, and 1.38 million deaths due to lung cancer were recorded. This high mortality rate is mainly due to the late stage at which lung cancer is diagnosed. While early diagnosis has been successfully implemented through tomography-based population screenings in high-risk individuals, there is a need for simpler, non-invasive and more accessible methodologies for effective early cancer detection programs. Circulating microRNA (miRNA) profiles have been suggested as promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for cancer, including lung cancer. However, the results have so far been inconsistent between studies. The objective of this study was to explore the potential of circulating miRNAs in plasma for early detection of lung cancer using global profiling approach. Plasma samples were collected from 100 early stage (I to IIIA) non-small-cell lung cancer patients (35 lung adenocarcinoma and 65 squamous cell carcinoma patients) and 100 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. 754 circulating miRNAs were analyzed via quantitative RT-PCR using TaqMan Low Density Arrays. Data were quantile normalized and limma analysis with adjustment for multiple testing to control for false discovery rate (FDR, Benjamini-Hochberg method) was performed to identify differentially regulated miRNA between cases and controls. Penalized Lasso logistic regression model (with penalty parameter tuning conducted by 10-fold cross-validation) was used to compute the least redundant panel of miRNAs for discriminating between cases and controls. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to assess the discriminatory power of the model. Internal validation was conducted by calculating the bootstrap optimism-corrected AUC for the selected model. Sixty one plasma miRNAs were found to be significantly differentially expressed between lung cancer cases and controls including 33 upregulated and 28 downregulated miRNAs (p-value Citation Format: Magdalena B.

52bf94b39998e29bbebf5868cd4daa9c9a734d58,High levels of cerebrospinal fluid chemokines point to the presence of neuroinflammation in peripheral neuropathic pain: a cross-sectional study of 2 cohorts of patients compared with healthy controls,"Abstract Animal models suggest that chemokines are important mediators in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. Indeed, these substances have been called â€œgliotransmitters,â€ a term that illustrates the close interplay between glial cells and neurons in the context of neuroinflammation and pain. However, evidence in humans is scarce. The aim of the study was to determine a comprehensive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory profile of patients with neuropathic pain. Our hypothesis was that we would thereby find indications of a postulated on-going process of central neuroinflammation. Samples of CSF were collected from 2 cohorts of patients with neuropathic pain (n = 11 and n = 16, respectively) and healthy control subjects (n = 11). The samples were analyzed with a multiplex proximity extension assay in which 92 inflammation-related proteins were measured simultaneously (Proseek Multiplex Inflammation I; Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden). Univariate testing with control of false discovery rate, as well as orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, were used for statistical analyses. Levels of chemokines CXCL6, CXCL10, CCL8, CCL11, CCL23 in CSF, as well as protein LAPTGF-beta-1, were significantly higher in both neuropathic pain cohorts compared with healthy controls, pointing to neuroinflammation in patients. These 6 proteins were also major results in a recent similar study in patients with fibromyalgia. The findings need to be confirmed in larger cohorts, and the question of causality remains to be settled. Because it has been suggested that prevalent comorbidities to chronic pain (eg, depression, anxiety, poor sleep, and tiredness) also are associated with neuroinflammation, it will be important to determine whether neuroinflammation is a common mediator.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Emmanuel BÃ¤ckryd"", ids = ""5940575""); list(name = ""Anne-Li Lind"", ids = ""39048291""); list(name = ""MÃ¥ns Thulin"", ids = ""10250373""); list(name = ""Anders Larsson"", ids = ""145484431""); list(name = ""BjÃ¶rn Gerdle"", ids = ""143878518""); list(name = ""Torsten E Gordh"", ids = ""4550651"")",9e7f25789cba365d3b0ba211191c2b3c68407be1; 2a6559b003ee06e289bf334cb6261d4a38071cbe; 1d64b6908907f84bb09c126af24c00d3927b6d4a; a94d7c5c44888494fcc3222a3c9fb67cb671ce8a; 52c2336faa17c71a3258aca59c425c136cead56b; b7b9f9aa983344e79dc81fb0fb3f4c2730a465f4; a00e063fe73bda4938166d99c8faf700ffc60f15; 99def82b6277168daad3239573f094f3ed2a5a6d; e37ce084232f25088b9db53a48f2d4b0161c6ede; 120138f6ef07fac0c75d777ffb9946480f613065; ab176908453350ad8e007634c9abcdf8400ca11d; 898baa90576f17715692009c7ee09be4e096367f; c6f9ae77879805db039856c38277770b2af875ec; e24893167c6ee3dacf77f08b80ad7c72628fe2af,76db4b4e7f2b2c03321474006631c35b060cd2ff; 6508634c308d171bbcbd852970efefff31ac32d8; 2ee955588b7a5ca282fcbcdd1173074cd5635444; 0a0018020cb0f8636f7f0b5bed660a4b420166cf; e2026a208395895794bfb8e83aa915f10834460a; 05517348e5f648a924f890d322987f0a7e5a1521; fd08782166a0d0ee684fed3eb5779f8214ff75ac; 756612242c703811c52417cfbff3cf4399b38945; 01856d5796889be729b3698f0eeef3f64678a0de; ab9137db8f6673f129adb318a7c09877b71019ed; d7f574151548715589a9c6a50012df7617b05802; ea55a199b501d8b1fd7ca3747f0d2a15f6455f7d; d9b952efea4d998f54ef174dbeaa3f5f574da251; 8f5e2284671f0deab76ec2a0373c5382187652d6; e222101829d31824323319432461c52f9a321aa8; 04be99df18e67a95d4ac81afca0cd45643193cbf; 4428746f7dd05ee1b29ace931df596002d4aeea9; f6dec5c66cb547b9a917a3f43731bef38cba9641; fc4e7698bec47eff4ea3d2b502891326ba2a2be1; dc6f28e64d4a14c2a03d8589bcc446fd1b4f6cf2; 9ab5971a7893f6c3d2bb5a064bd28733f46412d9; f3e1778575a937682ea45dd45d46742c2ce9fcbf; 20831af3ea0bf29602a0149d21856784aedaa55c; 476df5231d3415728774b46ba1fdaf53350210ca; 048bdb0c04c4e21dc711670512edb77bee5abf5c; 16a7bf0dc04280f2a32e0b511312bda1538ae9fd; 145d866cbb6320a0a223c054d21f9863a221e8e8; f62044650cdc234e985f11f19673c574d418c876; fb6b97a111246b28b202d0e89f0da302df6812cc; 0400b593b94ac873b7088a9ce237a7ef4be84579; 80fe145db356413bca4ecab26c6332467f50b183; 5415270207561fa2e74b1d1a7a866b5a1c50a8a4; fc7df6c627a3484d4b9d171f80fb130b8c1afb1a; ee8ce24b9afd2334620beab8e6d82eecb34e690d; 1cf426bbacce378930a8787030370b3dad8d903b; 9dab5c8ffa22cfcdf32d7a6ca09ae68fb8d35467; 49998a755c50de38ad9fc9b5db3776bada7b20e6; 6830e50d47baa7b998345fd45f16724ef2461118; 51361c45cedb6130fd2a3535fc8bfb3a9ef533f1; da09f142485cbe2242560113fbbc8b55dedbd538; e75ccee104850ea4adb776a7b3d9cff6b3530109; 190684d01fe3f1a8f90bd6473afff196ee324f29; 6aad05928229ee1f47f6d7f535107a5e388857cd; 468ea242d4e050059170ec65f28c7722b04bf592; 794ca75e9af68373845a11dd51c5741b77f698f9; 74d2232b22f32488653b732d225f72e3db2b5ae5; 08475266047d6ef9b107e3647d052d789fd90c5d; 4238dd73adf9f88c71882828d37ef18844121fb8; 8f56ea9249c1931bed480ffbf6a2e4f166dc7a58; 739c006d74e0ec90a7564340c69257d88c31dffb; 53b0b5543c9ab3d87c9ba60cdca54322f0cf5eed; d902e896019a96efc05ae57f2cce12aeb160559f; 3b9234175531e805b1e74e2fa1d15e4eefdb53aa; 8773dcbcd3fda8b8834768bc16aef4c26742db5e; fd4724c1eb4df16a20ae2b00f55425ae16dcecb1; 42b3b7235d2359ddf4852a0eb4e27a3c59f9563f; 5cfd9c6e69de2db9640cece6a74c1a9737a2974e; efaaf987aadfcc91e586c3176a73a872f767a78f; d215cae7dda3e53f9eb458cae1d6e3bcc5bede28; 343048e81fbedda43db066d29584b68ee70953c5; d9add5686039cb60a4fa147b71c7b8cea6af41fd; 6f333affab3cba76a0b7aeb7039431e877c97759; e40e556e43674399459f1c42afb216afb6068317; 962bc5a81c13f12fa15ff5dd4853cf35d7765fc6; 64f3a09c34ad12759b6e063e279570703bf27e54; 71dc135bca3f5ed9bc7579dcbfdb0cdb91f12687; 8447c4c688807a872e4b67029c7505137e72746e; 460710c23bb31d38520b5064c4f9aa8f0e6d4583; 6a2e77bcb8eec07a84a4396e60ff900ebaefabbf; 1545456ddb766bdfb03cc5f5e533bf225e766ac0; f345a209a2520cada3ffac37403226835c6ef712; 92baf62f119c3502a1d8c0bba58f4237f2b30ef2; a3dafd7708d64ae786c9036af351c995ec46d8d7; 2184194e0caf582fb9a62af76f081f4fd3a857a0; 7f81d68b03efaa4ee37b245e9dcb9a6d3df896c8; 0bf86d527107d98d07d53182cee9c8d518628885; b279e62a0f3c20444a99c61370b7648f697e0d49; d1fcfcb0dd24a5ed971bdb6255938ab3d8639680; e6cd9991d7da887457817ecf7d9d7f9c6df80632; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 8fe1257dcb5eba933fb7cf0d23a9ba1741741f9b; ccd10d18d1ffcd2f0dc3daf28e8d1b0feba3f9ab,Pain,158,2487 - 2495
c732a3bf5ff4cbfa477ee37fb072958a7e7e6ccc,Cell-specific gene expression in Langerhans cell histiocytosis lesions reveals a distinct profile compared with epidermal Langerhans cells.,"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease characterized by heterogeneous lesions containing CD207(+) Langerhans cells (LCs) and lymphocytes that can arise in almost any tissue and cause significant morbidity and mortality. After decades of research, the cause of LCH remains speculative. A prevailing model suggests that LCH arises from malignant transformation and metastasis of epidermal LCs. In this study, CD207(+) cells and CD3(+) T cells were isolated from LCH lesions to determine cell-specific gene expression. Compared with control epidermal CD207(+) cells, the LCH CD207(+) cells yielded 2113 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate < 0.01). Surprisingly, the expression of many genes previously associated with LCH, including cell-cycle regulators, proinflammatory cytokines, and chemokines, were not significantly different from control LCs in our study. However, several novel genes whose products activate and recruit T cells to sites of inflammation, including SPP1 (osteopontin), were highly overexpressed in LCH CD207(+) cells. Furthermore, several genes associated with immature myeloid dendritic cells were overexpressed in LCH CD207(+) cells. Compared with the peripheral CD3(+) cells from LCH patients, the LCH lesion CD3(+) cells yielded only 162 differentially regulated genes (false discovery rate < 0.01), and the expression profile of the LCH lesion CD3(+) cells was consistent with an activated regulatory T cell phenotype with increased expression of FOXP3, CTLA4, and SPP1. Results from this study support a model of LCH pathogenesis in which lesions do not arise from epidermal LCs but from accumulation of bone marrow-derived immature myeloid dendritic cells that recruit activated lymphocytes.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Carl E Allen"", ids = ""48292006""); list(name = ""Liunan Li"", ids = ""47681754""); list(name = ""Tricia L.

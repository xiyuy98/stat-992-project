f496967c9129f7ff74020e082672d6585822ab30,High-resolution genome screen for bone mineral density in heterogeneous stock rat.,"We previously demonstrated that skeletal mass, structure, and biomechanical properties vary considerably in heterogeneous stock (HS) rat strains. In addition, we observed strong heritability for several of these skeletal phenotypes in the HS rat model, suggesting that it represents a unique genetic resource for dissecting the complex genetics underlying bone fragility. The purpose of this study was to identify and localize genes associated with bone mineral density in HS rats. We measured bone phenotypes from 1524 adult male and female HS rats between 17 and 20 weeks of age. Phenotypes included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements for bone mineral content and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) for femur and lumbar spine (L3-L5), and volumetric BMD measurements by CT for the midshaft and distal femur, femur neck, and fifth lumbar vertebra (L5). A total of 70,000 polymorphic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed throughout the genome were selected from genotypes obtained from the Affymetrix rat custom SNPs array for the HS rat population. These SNPs spanned the HS rat genome with a mean linkage disequilibrium coefficient between neighboring SNPs of 0.95. Haplotypes were estimated across the entire genome for each rat using a multipoint haplotype reconstruction method, which calculates the probability of descent for each genotyped locus from each of the eight founder HS strains. The haplotypes were tested for association with each bone density phenotype via a mixed model with covariate adjustment. We identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for BMD phenotypes on chromosomes 2, 9, 10, and 13 meeting a conservative genomewide empiric significance threshold (false discovery rate [FDR]â€‰= 5%; p < 3 Ã— 10(-6)). Importantly, most QTLs were localized to very small genomic regions (1-3 megabases [Mb]), allowing us to identify a narrow set of potential candidate genes including both novel genes and genes previously shown to have roles in skeletal development and homeostasis.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Imranul Alam"", ids = ""3770319""); list(name = ""Daniel L.

bb443f925a533944afcc398179fb7350a408cdda,Stability Indicators in Network Reconstruction,"The number of available algorithms to infer a biological network from a dataset of high-throughput measurements is overwhelming and keeps growing. However, evaluating their performance is unfeasible unless a 'gold standard' is available to measure how close the reconstructed network is to the ground truth. One measure of this is the stability of these predictions to data resampling approaches. We introduce NetSI, a family of Network Stability Indicators, to assess quantitatively the stability of a reconstructed network in terms of inference variability due to data subsampling. In order to evaluate network stability, the main NetSI methods use a global/local network metric in combination with a resampling (bootstrap or cross-validation) procedure. In addition, we provide two normalized variability scores over data resampling to measure edge weight stability and node degree stability, and then introduce a stability ranking for edges and nodes. A complete implementation of the NetSI indicators, including the Hamming-Ipsen-Mikhailov (HIM) network distance adopted in this paper is available with the R package nettools. We demonstrate the use of the NetSI family by measuring network stability on four datasets against alternative network reconstruction methods. First, the effect of sample size on stability of inferred networks is studied in a gold standard framework on yeast-like data from the Gene Net Weaver simulator. We also consider the impact of varying modularity on a set of structurally different networks (50 nodes, from 2 to 10 modules), and then of complex feature covariance structure, showing the different behaviours of standard reconstruction methods based on Pearson correlation, Maximum Information Coefficient (MIC) and False Discovery Rate (FDR) strategy. Finally, we demonstrate a strong combined effect of different reconstruction methods and phenotype subgroups on a hepatocellular carcinoma miRNA microarray dataset (240 subjects), and we validate the analysis on a second dataset (166 subjects) with good reproducibility.",2014,Biology; Physics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michele Filosi"", ids = ""1723774""); list(name = ""Roberto Visintainer"", ids = ""1683587""); list(name = ""Samantha Riccadonna"", ids = ""1706884""); list(name = ""Giuseppe Jurman"", ids = ""1680819""); list(name = ""Cesare Furlanello"", ids = ""1687584"")",7886025fb7cb8339b5d006c8dc5b3514fbec09b2; 4150c270adaa8c4195aed4303370b343b18bbcf2; df1e8ad4d1c4e6d896ac8ce38bc77fab9a306f40; f930f1b2ef9744c116ee06d6d4598f480248aefb; 68418cd52cb8d635c14ac401f584b36ecb78764d; 69e901b5984ffb6951c47bed06aaeaa42980309c; 687370b408ceaaf5906fe1bb1ed58f99a38659e8; a65d34f555a23b5113c108d4858d956e35be88e5; 90277d784b7ef46311f43c41bcbe44ed4ecea553; 4534978fa1ae38bfe8ec9c75a8b95e5011819449; d9e3ca9598937851335283cf73ef811a4ee06097; 5545c0951ef69d7e00e8115c590d0569c5b3cd07,cfe6590d2386ee613e5535ff6532342d0e17a6dc; 2f325e9ba61f92f1f110f8979664927b2d208b37; df1e8ad4d1c4e6d896ac8ce38bc77fab9a306f40; 7d026d74c57e0d6002c746fb5239460cf26685aa; 0da38506db47bb9af817a3e54091b275bc37d023; e7b5f2a2f23e0d32972705b5ec857599253601bc; b0ed2dd0fb4f0f868b199ccc46129859a8f0d2e7; 688c3b6ef53d2c42f2df3e9f5001972a1e5b203b; 42578505ac5afff5a25707dffa34a5ff6831a989; bcc8de1ea0957673c70490b8b2db50733b5689ee; 2301a2bbcd7b7d03cf753b1a041000938e6c6186; 809ac759c8f169d6448784597527d40cd1c3ba1b; d43547d433eb4e194721f830f38bbb9612e64c4e; 9de3f1ed6352262b24c63c3dad62e15a3ef5a653; ee936443b87925a0e969be8f648a3eaf6d2d3cef; 470337b3078d6173eeced10460134fa06b0534e4; e185c15075e3aa2998eb42cdf73d4cdb29e61c0a; 8d1f074027a821552fb12cc892ce129223fce0ca; fe5fa066271a1873819b797cadb8fda7fc794b54; 09e7e4b1a8eba9c4822737eeb4697feea627b223; 8434976c3003bc8e2034c7f9527d7922beffd2f9; 2dffb568f5aabb679d24cb3d27fc59ac49598331; 0b092bac8095dba6067f4994d9f218043fcd3237; e47db726ee1323db97a1c475c3ecfd91ad7da6de; eae97fb7c27ecafa785bc67dce5c0a9f211c3bb4; 965c1496efb3015dc3659457640e5abeef8cef5c; 17cab7eadb01085117ecb57050f09dd72de6f5cf; 5cc9996d2b7992679ec9b65444877cd1d1857bd3; 8c9501b5bef568dd7c6fc72a189c35d68b6beb4a; c0cf718b7cfdd3bf19cab981a8995f5f2072eba3; 7ebd8688ede526e1c6e6f3c9b78e533f2bccb594; bd25a98194db5ef3a1c362c4a2938d08a2e8ac42; e8ed956ce6a454ffb74a915f02280799eb1f133a; 63da12ce1ebc359bb30273e16fe863b151577b13; 552864bc65bb43d7b1e3322fc9180d43b5d1897d; 134af9442c4d096567600a4e61963ac9d342fc08; 8f7714e42d546d89d092e467532bcc66ebc90eea; dc23e4adb03bda1af1330d3ee4e3fdda5c353cc9; 8a5329acdae6e2ec4795b2218840ca2d569b3e77; 70e3ec5bfacf7c3268af90b04f3e3959f9dae91b; b0cd6c33ae0e71edd43d04b47c889e7ad3c3073b; 4c7571ea04572d3e233aff03487b9a321596cfa2; f03586d54f75a6f7bd71bc0a6469d28df301c943; ebe875cf08dd398e0ed25f518502301c984a9afe; 391eeb0c5549c7519c95c02ecac5f5da9d2b5e2e; 57bf7d5296f5b087d83ec6ef591b3b3dd8e5025c; cf6574c6ab1b8f89c7d9ffc8f025aaf2517b1f79; e81e4898318994c308fd5d188005b475fb3113c2; e9836aef74027cfcb0853e52dd2b86faeedd7b48; 8057d006458d9aed56fb9a098f3219558731a762; 093011f242423e9621b0cd19de0af620f7b974e4; 1baeee2a2f2701d177c5461a90410b18f900d414; 00ae5e12df354c4c70b7d51863c6f9f15e44a46a; a9e9bd83ecb56aac660f77d21161d3f74aa6b33b; 219e8dfd0e1fed5a37fe8b3d67e9ceb0aba9c190; ed2d4788e61b0cc158b49e814f55cdc108f0a72e; ebe84f0bc819368c0b184fbcb65b6db35e295140; 8fc1d380d4aa32501f5b9b2bcd4240a63cfe6c12; 931a463efae81ab9c02402b8eed004364a13f0df; 204c7ec0f5d35e45393580b009a35423da1db7f3; 557e1bf9a438658700f377f5f3dd7d67ec7e13f5; d577f656be9a1aa6d951dfd8cb02867d7194f4a8; 968d8bd5f9420b53f050cdc3dfbe5afcdd0e2de4; ceab7aff753cd74e1192a99dde7f5dd2ff8fdbf2; 1162bb9da2c7cf2d92c2e119eb3aa468fe5825ef; 8d37d0c762402578a795f6ede4693af0ef388eb0; b218929f090f4ce33cec0bb76f59824997c7ba67; 45d7345cf9b160fbe0169fc396ff0f60f4f8644a; fa68093ce64240e73b94545459c36af8255c511e; 39dae53515afb42664369c291ec6d1ce34d778bd; d57ee61ff557bda25c6ca890d6ce1347474a1eb9; 820d5ea0b8d86836b5d7cc80935dcd7487abdcb4; c27e16cf9b626e983ad6372a25e98e060053afcb; 0814e577132f39ed991a2c2060b7d9ba69b8bfcc; 3251d1dce182e0a384580f20d26ede834c5c93ef,PLoS ONE,9,
abb34c8a14134d103a51dd0baeea32369db38813,CHARACTERIzATION OF PEPTIDES AND PROTEINS IN THERAPEUTIC HUMAN SERUM ALBUMIN,"Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant plasma protein, with described ligand-binding and transport properties, antioxidant functions, and enzymatic activities. Commercial HSA is indicated for re-establishing and maintaining circulatory volume in situations resulting from traumatic shock, surgery or blood loss. [1] HSA is also used in extracorporeal liver support devices that performs blood dialysis against this protein. [2] Therapeutic HSA accounts for 14 % of the global market volume for plasma products. Although therapeutic HSA has been used for more than 50 years, the composition of the commercial product remains unclear. Characterization of its composition is, however, crucial in order to understand its therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, as well as the mechanisms involved in different albumin therapies. Here, we present the results from an exhaustive analysis of therapeutic human serum albumin composition using proteomic approaches. Low abundant proteins and peptides in these samples were concentrated using a strong anion exchange (SAX) resin (ion exchanger MARS, Gambro, Lund, Sweden). The absorbed material was eluted with stepwise gradient of ammonium trifluoroacetate and the resulting fraction analyzed by MDLC-MS/MS using an LTQ ion trap. Besides albumin, a total of 1467 peptides corresponding to 102 proteins were identified with a false discovery rate of 1%. Relative to the human plasma proteome (www.plasmaproteomedatabase.org), the collection of proteins identified was apparently enriched on proteins involved in immunity and defense and transport (www.",2009,Chemistry,"list(name = ""Montserrat Carrascal"", ids = ""2824789""); list(name = ""Marina Gorga"", ids = ""38894035""); list(name = ""Albert ParÃ©s"", ids = ""144166281""); list(name = ""Joaquin Abian"", ids = ""3224311"")",,b5c4b6f0af7cf972363525ab6c0f315bbdea10dc; b4c8abbd75dba05f05f32efd3d1cbdadd73110df,,,144-144
9d6e3b3ab14093f2f9a8d50513cdbafcde594735,CD97 promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion through exosome-mediated MAPK signaling pathway.,"AIM
To investigate the mechanism underlying the promoting role of CD97 in gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion.


METHODS
Two types of exosomes released by gastric cancer cells with high (SGC/wt) or low (SGC/kd) CD97 expression were isolated by ultracentrifugation and identified by electron microscopy and western blot analysis. The influences of the two exosomes on gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion were investigated by proliferation and Matrigel invasion assays. Exosomal miRNAs were subsequently isolated from the two samples and their miRNA profiles were compared via microarray assay analysis. Reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the microarray assay. Target genes of the differently expressed microRNAs were predicted based on five independent algorithms and were then subjected to gene oncology enrichment and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. After identifying the pathway that was the most likely altered, tumor cells were treated with the two exosomes at different concentrations, and the pathway activation was identified through western blot analysis.


RESULTS
Exosomes isolated from SGC/wt cells significantly promoted tumor cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. SGC/wt exosomes also significantly elevated the invasiveness of both SGC/wt (129.67 Â± 8.327 vs 76.00 Â± 5.292, P < 0.001) and SGC/kd (114.52 Â± 9.814 vs 45.73 Â± 4.835, P < 0.001) cells as compared to the exosomes released by SGC/kd cells. Microarray assay of the two exosomes revealed that 62 miRNAs were differently regulated with a signal intensity of > 500 and a false discovery rate < 0.05. The following KEGG analysis defined the MAPK signaling pathway as the most likely candidate pathway that regulated tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Through western blot analysis, significant up-regulations of phosphorylated MAPKs, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase, Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, were detected in a dose-dependent manner in the SGC/wt exosomes treated groups, confirming activation of the MAPK signaling pathway stimulated by SGC/wt exosomes.

0fade85074ad4a9180bc19e05ae5bac13d76241d,Gray and white matter alterations in early HIV-infected patients: Combined voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics.,"PURPOSE
To investigate both the gray matter (GM) and whiter matter (WM) alterations in a homogeneous cohort of early HIV-infected patients by combining voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty-six HIV and 26 control subjects enrolled in this study with 3D T1 and diffusion-tensor imaging acquired on a 3.0T Siemens scanner. Group differences in regional GM were assessed using VBM analysis, while differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and relative anisotropy (RD) of WM were evaluated using TBSS analysis. After that, interactions between GM changes and white matter alterations were investigated by using a correlation analysis.


RESULTS
The HIV-infected patients displayed decreased GM volume, mainly located in the bilateral frontal cortices, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, and left supplementary motor area (P < 0.05, false discovery rate-corrected). Meanwhile, the patient group showed decreased FA in the genu of capsule callosum, body of capsule callosum, and bilateral anterior corona radiate (P < 0.05, family wise error [FEW]-corrected). Areas of increased MD, RD, and AD in HIV patients were more extensive and observed in most skeleton locations (P < 0.05, FEW-corrected). The interaction analysis in the patient group revealed that there were no significant correlations between GM changes and WM alterations (P > 0.05).


CONCLUSION
Our results indicate that structural brain alterations occurred early in HIV-infected patients. The current study may shed further light on the potential brain effects of HIV. J. Magn. Reson.

1bd8f3ebc03f36ba57cf17138887c0ebd36e7d7e,Differential expression of tissue repair genes in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"RATIONALE
The airflow limitation that defines severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is caused by a combination of small airway obstruction and emphysematous lung destruction.


OBJECTIVES
To examine the hypothesis that small airway obstructive and emphysematous destructive lesions are produced by differential expression of genes associated with tissue repair.


METHODS
The expression of 54 genes associated with repair of repetitively damaged tissue was measured in 136 paired samples of small bronchioles and surrounding lung tissue separated by laser capture microdissection. These samples were collected from 63 patients at different levels of disease severity who required surgery for either lung cancer or lung transplantation for very severe COPD. Gene expression was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in these paired samples and compared with the FEV(1) by linear regression analysis.


MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS
After corrections for false discovery rates, only 2 of 10 genes (serpin peptidase inhibitor/plasminogen activator inhibitor member 2 and matrix metalloproteinase [MMP] 10) increased, whereas 8 (MMP2, integrin-alpha1, vascular endothelial growth factor, a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 33, scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2, fibronectin, and collagen 3alpha1) decreased in small airways in association with FEV(1). In contrast, 8/12 genes (early growth response factor 1, MMP1, MMP9, MMP10, plasminogen activator urokinase, plasminogen activator urokinase receptor, tumor necrosis factor, and IL13) increased and 4/12 (MMP2, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1, collagen 1alpha1, and transforming growth factor-beta3) decreased in the surrounding lung tissue in association with progression of COPD.


CONCLUSIONS
The progression of COPD is associated with the differential expression of a cluster of genes that favor the degradation of the tissue surrounding the small conducting airways.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""John Gosselink"", ids = ""144264436""); list(name = ""Shizu Hayashi"", ids = ""3201060""); list(name = ""W.

e8f460d6b20dc4454fed6751a2347d7eaeb34134,Elevated lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 products predict progression of chronic kidney disease.,"Background
The clinical relevance of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression is poorly understood. We aimed to compare the concentrations of 85 enzymatic pathway products of AA metabolism in patients with CKD who progressed to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) versus patients who did not in a subcohort of Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) and to estimate the risk of CKD progression and major cardiovascular events by levels of AA metabolites and their link to enzymatic metabolic pathways.


Methods
A total 123 patients in the CRIC study who progressed to ESKD were frequency matched with 177 nonprogressors and serum eicosanoids were quantified by mass spectrometry. We applied serum collected at patients' Year 1 visit and outcome of progression to ESKD was ascertained over the next 10â€‰years. We used logistic regression models for risk estimation.


Results
Baseline 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoate (HETE) and 20-HETE levels were significantly elevated in progressors (false discovery rate Qâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.026). The median 20-HETE level was 7.6â€‰pmol/mL [interquartile range (IQR) 4.2-14.5] in progressors and 5.4â€‰pmol/mL (IQR 2.8-9.4) in nonprogressors (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). In an adjusted model, only 20-HETE independently predicted CKD progression. Each 1 standard deviation increase in 20-HETE was independently associated with 1.45-fold higher odds of progression (95% confidence interval 1.07-1.95; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.017). Principal components of lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathways were independently associated with CKD progression.


Conclusions
We found higher odds of CKD progression associated with higher 20-HETE, LOX and CYP450 metabolic pathways. These alterations precede CKD progression and may serve as targets for interventions aimed at halting progression.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Farsad Afshinnia"", ids = ""6656894""); list(name = ""Lixia Zeng"", ids = ""50483766""); list(name = ""Jaeman Byun"", ids = ""2193358""); list(name = ""Stefanie Wernisch"", ids = ""14599683""); list(name = ""Rajat Deo"", ids = ""3697206""); list(name = ""Jing Chen"", ids = ""1719866""); list(name = ""Lee Hamm"", ids = ""48948546""); list(name = ""Edgar R.

62a92a4165f9be553aa7cb92f85e0925bc147239,Automating Mendelian randomization through machine learning to construct a putative causal map of the human phenome,"A major application for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been the emerging field of causal inference using Mendelian randomization (MR), where the causal effect between a pair of traits can be estimated using only summary level data. MR depends on SNPs exhibiting vertical pleiotropy, where the SNP influences an outcome phenotype only through an exposure phenotype. Issues arise when this assumption is violated due to SNPs exhibiting horizontal pleiotropy. We demonstrate that across a range of pleiotropy models, instrument selection will be increasingly liable to selecting invalid instruments as GWAS sample sizes continue to grow. Methods have been developed in an attempt to protect MR from different patterns of horizontal pleiotropy, and here we have designed a mixture-of-experts machine learning framework (MR-MoE 1.0) that predicts the most appropriate model to use for any specific causal analysis, improving on both power and false discovery rates. Using the approach, we systematically estimated the causal effects amongst 2407 phenotypes. Almost 90% of causal estimates indicated some level of horizontal pleiotropy. The causal estimates are organised into a publicly available graph database (http://eve.mrbase.org), and we use it here to highlight the numerous challenges that remain in automated causal inference.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Gibran Hemani"", ids = ""2147157""); list(name = ""Jack Bowden"", ids = ""47929819""); list(name = ""Philip C Haycock"", ids = ""145904528""); list(name = ""Jie Jane Zheng"", ids = ""50021363""); list(name = ""Oliver S.

Conventional hypothesis testing of between group differences for each adverse event can be problematic: Lack of significance does not mean lack of risk, the tests usually are not adjusted for multiplicity, and the data determine which hypotheses are tested. This paper describes a Bayesian screening approach that does not test hypotheses, is self-adjusting for multiplicity, provides a direct assessment of the likelihood of no material drug-event association, and quantifies the strength of the observed association. The approach directly incorporates clinical judgment by having the criteria for treatment association determined by the investigator(s). Diagnostic properties can be evaluated analytically.

Specifically, we evaluate the influence on the marginal distribution of local false discovery rate statistics, which are used in many multiple testing procedures and related to Bayesian posterior probabilities. Explicit forms of the marginal distributions under both correctly specified and incorrectly specified models are derived. The Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence is used to quantify the influence caused by a misspecification. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the influence.

6e2ecd3c67fee859b2b4f3e76c75a1b9a9d164e6,Defining the nitrogen regulated transcriptome of Mycobacterium smegmatis using continuous culture,"BackgroundNitrogen is essential for microbial growth and its importance is demonstrated by the complex regulatory systems used to control the transport, assimilation and metabolism of nitrogen. Recent studies are beginning to shed light on how mycobacteria respond to nitrogen limitation and several regulators (e.g., GlnR, PII) have been characterized at a molecular level. However, despite this progress, our knowledge of the transcriptional response of mycobacteria to nitrogen limitation and its regulation is confined to batch culture.MethodsTo gain further insight into the response of mycobacteria to nitrogen limitation, we developed a nitrogen-limited chemostat. We compared the transcriptional response of nitrogen-limited cells to carbon-limited cells using RNA-seq analysis in a continuous culture model at a constant growth rate.ConclusionsOur findings revealed significant changes in the expression of 357 genes (208 upregulated, 149 downregulated; >2-fold change, false discovery rate <5 %) in response to nitrogen limitation in continuous culture. The vast majority of the GlnR regulon (68 %) was differentially expressed under nitrogen limitation in continuous culture and approximately 52 % of the 357 genes overlapped with a previously published study investigating the response of M. smegmatis to nitrogen limitation in batch culture, while expression of only 17 % of the genes identified in batch culture were affected in our chemostat model. Moreover, we identified a unique set of 45 genes involved in the uptake and metabolism of nitrogen that were exclusive to our chemostat model. We observed strong downregulation of pathways for amino acid catabolism (i.e., alanine, aspartate, valine, proline and lysine), suggesting preservation of these amino acids for critical cellular function. We found 16 novel transcriptional regulators that were directly or indirectly involved in the global transcriptomic response of M. smegmatis to nitrogen limitation and identified several non-coding RNAs that might be involved in the transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of nitrogen-regulated gene expression.ResultsUsing nitrogen-limited continuous culture we identified the nitrogen-responsive transcriptome of M. smegmatis, including a number of small non-coding RNAs implicated in controlling nitrogen-regulated gene expression.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael Petridis"", ids = ""49127999""); list(name = ""Andrej Benjak"", ids = ""4518619""); list(name = ""Gregory M.

dcbee44b89f3f0d7ebc00f192ededd51dc77fd72,Advances in protein complex analysis by chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry (CXMS) and bioinformatics.,"For the analysis of protein-protein interactions and protein conformations, cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry (CXMS) has become an essential tool in recent years. A variety of cross-linking reagents are used to covalently link interacting amino acids to identify protein-binding partners. The spatial proximity of cross-linked amino acid residues is used to elucidate structural models of protein complexes. The main challenges for mapping protein-protein interaction are low stoichiometry and low frequency of cross-linked peptides relative to unmodified linear peptides as well as accurate and efficient matches to corresponding peptide sequences with low false discovery rates for identifying the site of cross-link. We evaluate the current state of chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry applications with the special emphasis on the recent development of informatics data processing and analysis tools that help complexity of interpreting CXMS data.

689e0ef3e340f1d0e7e414031f41e2047c73d3be,Common variants of four bilirubin metabolism genes and their association with serum bilirubin and coronary artery disease in Chinese Han population.,"OBJECTIVES
Studies have revealed an inverse relationship between serum total bilirubin (TBIL) levels and coronary artery disease (CAD). This study investigated the genetic variants of four bilirubin metabolism genes--heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), biliverdin reductase A (BLVRA), solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1), and uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1)--in relation to TBIL levels and CAD.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Thirty-five common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 2380 unrelated Han participants who underwent angiocardiography at hospitals in Shanghai, China. Only three genetic variants--rs4399719 (UGT1A1 T-2473G), rs887829 (UGT1A1 G-364A), and rs4148323 (UGT1A1 G211A)--were associated with TBIL levels (each P<0.001). Four significant associations with CAD were detected after controlling age and the false discovery rate at 15%: the recessive effect of SNP rs887829 (UGT1A1 G-364A) [age-adjusted odds ratio (OR): 0.24; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.10-0.60; P=0.0014] and dominant effect of rs4149013 (SLCO1B1 A-12099G) (age-adjusted OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.55-0.91; P=0.0069) on male CAD, and the additive effects of rs2877262 (BLVRA G+1238/in6C) (age-adjusted OR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.59-0.89; P=0.0021) and rs2690381 (BLVRA G+2613/in6A) (age-adjusted OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.56-0.86; P=0.0008) on female CAD. SNPs rs2877262 and rs2690381 were both in a linkage disequilibrium block within BLVRA with r greater than 0.750. Correspondingly, this block was identified to be associated with female CAD.

318b881e6d18bdb6f0e249c1248a26b007cdeeaa,Removing Sequential Bottlenecks in Analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing Data,"Throughput from sequencing instruments has been increasing in an unprecedented speed, leading to an explosion of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, and challenges in storing, managing, and analyzing these datasets. Parallelism is the key in handling large-scale data, and some progress has been made in parallelizing important steps, like sequence alignment. However, other major steps continue to be sequential, limiting the ability to handle massive datasets. In this paper, we focus on parallelizing algorithms from two areas. The first is efficient data format conversion among a wide variety of sequence data formats, which is important for cross-utilization of different analysis modules. The second is statistical analysis. Our parallelization sequence data format converter allows sequence datasets in BAM/SAM format to be converted into multiple formats, including SAM/BAM, BED, FASTA, FASTQ, BEDGRAPH, JSON, and YAML, using both shared memory and distributed memory parallelism. The converter currently comprises three instances: SAM format converter, BAM format converter and preprocessing-optimized SAM format converter.

89cf7ca845aa5f6339d41ca6cc68b38978838951,Chronic radiation-associated dysphagia in oropharyngeal cancer survivors: Towards age-adjusted dose constraints for deglutitive muscles,"Abstract Objectives We sought to model chronic radiation-associated dysphagia (RAD) in patients given intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) as a function of age and dose to non-target swallowing muscles. Methods We reviewed 300 patients with T1-T4â€¯N0-3â€¯M0 OPSCC given definitive IMRT with concurrent chemotherapy. Chronic RAD was defined as aspiration or stricture on videoflouroscopy/endoscopy, gastrostomy tube, or aspiration pneumonia at â‰¥12â€¯months after IMRT. Doses to autosegmented regions of interest (ROIs; inferior, middle and superior constrictors, anterior and posterior digastrics, mylo/geniohyoid complex, intrinsic tongue, and gengioglossus) were obtained from DICOM-RT plans and dose-volume histograms. The probability of chronic RAD as a function of mean ROI dose, stratified by age ( Results Chronic RAD was observed in 34 patients (11%). Age was a significant correlate of chronic RAD, both independently and with dose for all muscle groups examined. Distinct muscle-specific doseâ€“response profiles were observed as a function of age (e.g., 5% of patients in their 50â€¯s [but 20% of those 70â€¯+â€¯] who received 60â€¯Gy to the superior constrictor had chronic RAD). This effect was stable across all observed muscle ROIs, with a false discovery rate-corrected pâ€¯ Conclusions Age at treatment moderates the probability of chronic RAD after chemo-IMRT for OPSCC, with aging muscles showing lower dose thresholds.

a439058a6a6edead8c8ac212c0a5ab251e9c2fb2,Estimation and Control of the False Discovery Rate of Bayesian Network Skeleton Identification,"An important problem in learning Bayesian networks is assessing confidence on the learnt structure. Prior work in constraint-based algorithms focuses on estimating or controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) when identifying the skeleton (set of edges without regard of direction) of a network. We present a unified approach to estimation and control of the FDR of Bayesian network skeleton identification and experimentally evaluate the performance of a standard FDR estimator in both tasks over several benchmark networks and sample sizes. We demonstrate that conservative estimation and strong control of FDR are not achieved in some cases due to insufficient sample size and/or unfaithfulness. We show that a permutation-based and a parametric-bootstrapbased FDR estimator achieve more accurate FDR estimation and strong control than the standard estimator. Finally, we present a relaxed definition of false positive that leads to more conservative estimation and control of FDR in relatively small sample sizes.",2014,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Angelos P.

The objective of this study was to screen growth-related genes of M. salmoides by RNA sequencing and identify growth-related single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers through a growth association study. The muscle transcriptomes of fast- and slow-growing largemouth bass were obtained using the RNA-Seq technique. A total of 54,058,178 and 54,742,444 qualified Illumina read pairs were obtained for the fast-growing and slow-growing groups, respectively, giving rise to 4,865,236,020 and 4,926,819,960 total clean bases, respectively. Gene expression profiling showed that 3,530 unigenes were differentially expressed between the fast-growing and slow-growing phenotypes (false discovery rate â‰¤0.001, the absolute value of log2 (fold change) â‰¥1), including 1,441 up-regulated and 2,889 down-regulated unigenes in the fast-growing largemouth bass. Analysis of these genes revealed that several signalling pathways, including the growth hormoneâ€“insulin-like growth factor 1 axis and signalling pathway, the glycolysis pathway, and the myostatin/transforming growth factor beta signalling pathway, as well as heat shock protein, cytoskeleton, and myofibril component genes might be associated with muscle growth. From these genes, 10 genes with putative SNPs were selected, and 17 SNPs were genotyped successfully. Marker-trait analysis in 340 individuals of Youlu No. 1 largemouth bass revealed three SNPs associated with growth in key genes (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, FOXO3b, and heat shock protein beta-1).

e6095eefd70e3e5abe7991944044c9cdd9a6b693,Cell engineering with microfluidic squeezing preserves functionality of primary immune cells in vivo,"The translational potential of cell-based therapies is often limited by complications related to effectively engineering and manufacturing functional cells. While the use of electroporation is widespread, the impact of electroporation on cell state and function has yet to be fully characterized. Here, we use a genome-wide approach to study optimized electroporation treatment and identify striking disruptions in the expression profiles of key functional transcripts of human T cells. These genetic disruptions result in concomitant perturbation of cytokine secretion including a 648-fold increase in IL-2 secretion (P < 0.01) and a 30-fold increase in IFN-Î³ secretion (P < 0.05). Ultimately, the effects at the transcript and protein level resulted in functional deficiencies in vivo, with electroporated T cells failing to demonstrate sustained antigen-specific effector responses when subjected to immunological challenge. In contrast, cells subjected to a mechanical membrane disruption-based delivery mechanism, cell squeezing, had minimal aberrant transcriptional responses [0% of filtered genes misregulated, false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.1] relative to electroporation (17% of genes misregulated, FDR q < 0.1) and showed undiminished effector responses, homing capabilities, and therapeutic potential in vivo. In a direct comparison of functionality, T cells edited for PD-1 via electroporation failed to distinguish from untreated controls in a therapeutic tumor model, while T cells edited with similar efficiency via cell squeezing demonstrated the expected tumor-killing advantage. This work demonstrates that the delivery mechanism used to insert biomolecules affects functionality and warrants further study.",2018,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tia Ditommaso"", ids = ""3515934""); list(name = ""Julie M.

Simulations comparing the MTPs with other common model selection criteria demonstrate that, for conventional tuning parameters of the selection procedures, only MTPs consistently control the FDR, but have slightly lower power.

01ad79ad2c95deba462342ec18117d06076ea2d0,"Relation between variants in the neurotrophin receptor gene, NTRK3, and white matter integrity in healthy young adults","The NTRK3 gene (also known as TRKC) encodes a high affinity receptor for the neurotrophin 3'-nucleotidase (NT3), which is implicated in oligodendrocyte and myelin development. We previously found that white matter integrity in young adults is related to common variants in genes encoding neurotrophins and their receptors. This underscores the importance of neurotrophins for white matter development. NTRK3 variants are putative risk factors for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder hoarding, suggesting that some NTRK3 variants may affect the brain. To test this, we scanned 392 healthy adult twins and their siblings (mean age, 23.6 Â± 2.2 years; range: 20-29 years) with 105-gradient 4-Tesla diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We identified 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NTRK3 gene that have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. We used a multi-SNP model, adjusting for family relatedness, age, and sex, to relate these variants to voxelwise fractional anisotropy (FA) - a DTI measure of white matter integrity. FA was optimally predicted (based on the highest false discovery rate critical p), by five SNPs (rs1017412, rs2114252, rs16941261, rs3784406, and rs7176429; overall FDR critical p=0.028). Gene effects were widespread and included the corpus callosum genu and inferior longitudinal fasciculus - regions implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders and previously associated with other neurotrophin-related genetic variants in an overlapping sample of subjects. NTRK3 genetic variants, and neurotrophins more generally, may influence white matter integrity in brain regions implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders.",2013,Computer Science; Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Meredith N.

65458553ccb25aa6d4ababd17b59761f1748f015,Serum Inflammatory Cytokine Markers of Invasive Fungal Infection in Previously Immunocompetent Battle Casualties.,"BACKGROUND
Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is described increasingly in individuals experiencing high-energy military trauma. Hallmarks of successful treatment involve aggressive surgical debridement and early initiation of systemic antimicrobial therapy. Currently, intravenous anti-fungal therapy commences based on appearance of wounds and patient's clinical course. Whereas some clinical protocols exist to predict which critically injured patients should receive anti-fungal therapies, there are no established serum markers associated with IFI. Our hypothesis is that serum inflammatory cytokines exist that can assist in identifying individuals at risk for IFI.


METHODS
This is a retrospective case control study at a single institution. Nine patients with IFI (Saksenaea vasiformis, Fusarium sp., Graphium sp., Scedosporium sp., Aspergillus sp., Mucor sp., and Alternaria sp.) after battlefield trauma were matched to nine individuals with similar injury patterns whose laboratory results were negative for IFI. The combination of serum inflammatory cytokines from the first and second debridements was examined with multiplex platform proteomic analysis. We defined statistical significance as a two-tailed Î±<0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate method. This model was refined further with correlation-based filter selection and the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) was tested.


RESULTS
Both groups had similar Injury Severity Scores (ISS) (meanÂ±standard deviation [SD]) (26.8Â±15.5 vs. 29.2Â±16.8, p=0.766). Elevated RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) alone (10,492.8Â±4,450.1 vs. 5,333.3Â±4,162.2, p=0.006) correlated with IFI. Also, the combination of persistent elevations in RANTES, interleukin (IL)-2R, and IL-15 was a robust model for predicting IFI with the AUROC being 0.9.


CONCLUSIONS
Elevation in serum cytokines, particularly RANTES, correlated with IFI in this small group of patients. This demonstrates the potential of future rapid serum testing for early initiation and guidance of anti-fungal therapies.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jason S.

Researchers are actively investigating how new technologies can be used to identify chemical carcinogens in a more rapid and cost-effective manner. Here we performed a toxicogenomic case study of the liver carcinogen furan. Full study and mode of action details were previously published in the Journal of Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology. Female B6C3F1 mice were sub-chronically treated with two non-carcinogenic (1 and 2Â mg/kg bw) and two carcinogenic (4 and 8Â mg/kg bw) doses of furan for 21Â days. Half of the mice in each dose group were also treated with 0.02% bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for five days prior to sacrifice [13]. Agilent gene expression microarrays were used to measure changes in liver gene and long non-coding RNA expression (published in Toxicological Sciences). Here we describe the experimental and quality control details for the microarray data. We also provide the R code used to analyze the raw data files, produce fold change and false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p values for each gene, and construct hierarchical clustering between datasets.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Anna Francina Webster"", ids = ""31490781""); list(name = ""Andrew Williams"", ids = ""145256918""); list(name = ""Leslie Recio"", ids = ""143874354""); list(name = ""Carole L.

2638dd0b542f0ce74d3d06cd5febca40c4ec37e3,Genetic associations with lipoprotein subfraction measures differ by ethnicity in the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA),"A recent genome-wide association study associated 62 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 43 genomic loci, with fasting lipoprotein subfractions in Europeanâ€“Americans (EAs) at genome-wide levels of significance across three independent samples. Whether these associations are consistent across ethnicities with a non-European ancestry is unknown. We analyzed 15 lipoprotein subfraction measures, on 1677 Africanâ€“Americans (AAs), 1450 Hispanicâ€“Americans (HAs), and 775 Chineseâ€“Americans (CHN) participating in the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA). Genome-wide data were obtained using the Affymetrix 6.0 and Illumina HumanOmni chips. Linear regression models between genetic variables and lipoprotein subfractions were adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, smoking, study center, and genetic ancestry (based on principal components), and additionally adjusted for Mexican/Non-Mexican status in HAs. A false discovery rate correction was applied separately within the results for each ethnicity to correct for multiple testing. Power calculations revealed that we did not have the power for SNP-based measures of association, so we analyzed phenotype-specific genetic risk scores (GRSs), constructed as in the original genome-wide analysis. We successfully replicated all 15 GRSâ€“lipoprotein associations in 2527 EAs. Among the 15 significant GRSâ€“lipoprotein associations in EAs, 11 were significant in AAs, 13 in HAs, and 1 in CHNs. Further analyses revealed that ethnicity differences could not be explained by differences in linkage disequilibrium, lipid lowering drugs, diabetes, or gender. Our study emphasizes the importance of ethnicity (here indexing genetic ancestry) in genetic risk for CVD and highlights the need to identify ethnicity-specific genetic variants associated with CVD risk.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhe Wang"", ids = ""47197257""); list(name = ""Ani Manichukal"", ids = ""9758369""); list(name = ""David C.

33da96ac221f62ebb91efb6cbf6b80fe16c3c37a,Identification of aberrant cell cycle regulation in Epstein-Barr virus-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma by cDNA microarray and gene set enrichment analysis.,"Previous studies have revealed that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was closely associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aimed to characterize the global pathways affected in the EBV-associated NPC. Combined with microdissection, gene expression profiles in 22 NPCs and 10 non-tumor nasopharyngeal epithelial (NPE) tissue samples were analyzed. All NPC specimens served in the microarray analysis were positive for EBV, as judged by identification of the expression of EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1). Through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we found that cell cycle pathway was the most disregulated pathway in NPC (P=0.000, false discovery rate q-value=0.007), which included some aberrant expressed components. We first found that overexpression of CDK4, cyclin D1, and Rb proteins, and loss of expression of proteins p16, p27, and p19 were statistically significant in NPC tissues compared with non-cancerous NPE (P<0.05) by real-time RT-PCR and tissue microarray. EBV-encoded small RNA-1 (EBER-1) hybridization signals in the NPC showed significant associations with the overexpression of Rb (P=0.000), cyclin D1 (P=0.000), CDK4 (P=0.000), and the loss of expression of p16 proteins (P=0.039). In the final logistic regression analysis model, EBER-1 and abnormal expression of p16, Rb, cyclin D1, and E2F6 were independent contributions to nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis. Through survival analysis, only cyclin D1 could predict the prognosis of NPC patients. These results suggested that cell cycle pathway was the most disregulated pathway in the EBV-associated NPC, and EBER-1 was closely associated with p16, CDK4, cyclin D1, and Rb.cyclin D1 could be the prognosis biomarker for NPC.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wenling Zhang"", ids = ""2868210""); list(name = ""Zhaoyang Zeng"", ids = ""6253124""); list(name = ""Yanhong Zhou"", ids = ""2212332""); list(name = ""Wei Xiong"", ids = ""145824454""); list(name = ""Songqing Fan"", ids = ""38872253""); list(name = ""Lan Xiao"", ids = ""40165385""); list(name = ""Donghai Huang"", ids = ""4675908""); list(name = ""Zhang-jun Li"", ids = ""5249816""); list(name = ""Dan Li"", ids = ""1703869""); list(name = ""Minghua Wu"", ids = ""2868379""); list(name = ""Xiaoling Li"", ids = ""4162941""); list(name = ""Shourong Shen"", ids = ""3954953""); list(name = ""Rong Wang"", ids = ""49908299""); list(name = ""Li Cao"", ids = ""145046026""); list(name = ""Ke Tang"", ids = ""144994539""); list(name = ""Guiyuan Li"", ids = ""1685065"")",926e543313a3610a03fb1724b533dce374cb2fa6; a49d5a8404e259e68ab37ba3a30213ad53b80063; aab1820ce1068cc58a22dad42e71deda2d32af72; 62b280cdcfc5e081d8b3fc0ea383ba3f412027e4; 7afde7b6f76cb2a4dd9ab94af495b207abf5048d; 576ad6e8ab1a6e254502fffdecc17462cf87cd4e; 50c63d68ef3a36a642811b5bb289a105f47660d1; 9339180181e84e3d0803c6635c965216fbe2e9ae; b14ccb02d51052138cf67141c5500fa8accff2cf; a5fcef69b520ff73a141fe9ca5e88526d9714f5e; 5e0c5e6d5ef88c8fd6f858e6bfa47683224b6868; 3c79c836a47c5ddda67e309a31f555774bb29413; efc8bba99886cb045c4819fc24f5bf4c15a0724e; fdc8b7a53500ccf873abdba2606e43bd5a1e2ceb; 9eb7e9846fa9745a01548fe68c9fce8fef592726; 6e84f348a73cb2caa9224efddd59b52315b6e50b; 8305dac36aadb1dfacb373a617045f780bd6a5dd; c77f4c00a5846f37393355c90d15144f2b94dff3; 74d6d13b5dec50c27273431bc60bceb00096f803; e255d367b32400320321b8155106eb7a16c6ef05; 936cf78a44f9baeebc19bfdf3263b501fc7ea348; 55548a0577644d703a6c2260a8aa9df9f4ca5aae; b0458196dfcd472168ad3a656fe691baf5bf1468; ba9fa82324b51566a8c469d03c1cb84ea3aee033; e99d9c1a1446fea418f393753185e8648c226976; 1a09864089921d20a7af8d75205c45201e5bc54e; 307cb9186444d9dad6e2e3b53763be0de76de186; 942c5b7ca042532eb8309b4ca4c792aac3e0683a; bdbb14bff97092808b193e8ea158419d82e72181; e329f8ab6931e8a04be961357cc270bf44ac73fc; c5fe6c935d8cffafb57464c84292e787dde26a59; 1a063bc01e9cfeca23fbf131dfc074ffbcc382cc; ee0a2f2720751fba02a2c3d74c477c9d11f719eb; ea556dff3b26d6cd977d4abe998a8f0839c907bc; 87898a28092ac68c0f2e2a00f415f1761d59b97b; b21f31a1cbac46774cc5a3bc311ad0c0f03dabb4; 8fb16e975bad9c1001a6ea59863b3d222f92a5f3; f146109682961174c39ba5b14d55adb7c6408f42,63334e7de97f9f236370b04ef03e122c70134c2a; af512725ecbc7ae1b20a696fbc2e18862d37271e; 5d382ddf98d75e1385ee78df4664c6c938779aa3; 5bab70ee6e24963e1a73da8d9c40c79f9594f03f; 61fbc8c8809ddc42f8c284ace9eb93ffddb64bec; 3b3acec0795a37cb6a71444fc05ba3a9659c007c; 2e7e1ac6e8c5c1264b008e4207e5e787c66f589f; ec2848219e837013a44e0f6467ff9ca4eb75380a; dd4b846710fb9cf37396b530f93bf9ed51bedb99; 875304df02f9d95564825ec75af7901c5aa5bc68; ac5a4f801955318d3b47f044a54aca1fe9eda9b6; 75a4020ef3a1b2589dccf3237e6c8a0f447af5bf; 5a285dcb1585684398c42df5b20842f81114a4ad; 1ab360f43bfdd5cc692b9fa6464d11fc977bf4ef; 399e656d9ce42e9126f5306a2998f4f06d6e7d25; 030c79de342556b0cc579bc95f68b93c1874a93f; ffa16fd541c26da3a0a3c268089ea787e96a3dfe; f514ef7d43f481db50e7c68427dd1e59710bde53; 6a8a9372f7d6851752a32f2bde8f6f7333495df8; 130e331d61301a56e26631accf05819d0729fa9f; 353f9f31678ed6b9e0f48ec3f2f12ffc77faa013; 83fb9547c2033a8d6de733f6cb5f28f71440c011; a8e9d80301910f42952ba15b59ea40634638fb3c; 1af1c076a10b0149300335098d9464c598090e2b; 2049f47f39e11d03ff9a8bfe4022711b62d9c4a3; 531746f5fa4588f320b9ef5dc158d39a6d4a0b4c; eb5176e22f0f98f997e8d35c09cefa3df6d75f37; dad8fe7f51b0c2d175d925456038c0d3f9082a9f; d4b386986c0fc8270e065c93f518b292f7fbd69b; f1f736d18d44e19f34307fdb671164ff378dc16a; 62a5fff5a5e96b2982c89313f92867d7bfb98cbe; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; a9774897ced3a73b6ca5f304828dc8fee5431972; 388ebea57a12f1c0f74114b52f5f741d854ed3a6; 1a73489cf84b4fd12d191d1dbed9e59c3bce9098; 161cd0f2c7a52712c36dadd4a6ec301b5c42c00e; 244c4de27ab66e13cc7ad07a2c7553af947e8ee1; 020ee278753c01eaa5e06ae7c68699947db0159f; 3e305a720bfb50a5df99c8b052b8a8900bbce6bc; 7f2c7db00d0cecf8f8357d4c5a26e82f9e4f9a23; 5cc80f4ca531c53877ae29d7ad7400a9ad318300; f088609ca0bb05f7794a184af8c4c919bf99d1c5; ff945a8fa15021a30f2add671c654821508a176b; 8baeead4de43dd9fdfd81ef2eea04657d0834297; d38506712f31e24ca15e3907f5be69d393a3e9fd; 9774fce30480a16e590b9de35ecb70b5bba5215f; 22c17a48b7ee721a3052152e2b5f3b101497a6d7; 251e40a3502ff24f7b1ccdba4d8e50f7b3472727; ae368fa97d4f41129908fd94e12c32b4ee73b891,Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,41 5,"

04edb8f7ecf9b3a39c6082bb34be2b9f2a88856c,Reduced thickness of anterior cingulate cortex in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"INTRODUCTION
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by a pattern of repetitive, intrusive thoughts and behaviours that patients do not want to but feel they have to perform. Functional brain imaging revealed dysfunctional pathways in OCD involving the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and basal ganglia. Structural alterations in OCD have been discussed but analysis tools focussing on specific morphometric aspects such as cortical thickness have rarely been employed.


METHODS
We acquired MRI scans from 101 OCD patients and 95 healthy control subjects. FreeSurfer analysis software was employed to model the individual grey-white and pial surfaces to compute cortical thickness as our target measure.


RESULTS
Relative to controls, OCD patients demonstrate cortical thinning in dorsal and subgenual ACC (false discovery rate corrected at pÂ <Â .001), as well as in several other regions within the fronto-parietal network (false discovery rate corrected at pÂ <Â .05). Cortical thickness could not be predicted in whole brain analyses from symptom state, but there was a modest correlation of left dorsal ACC thickness with the obsession subscore of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale as well as with the Beck Depression Inventory score.

We examined 154 SNPs in 12 metastasis-related genes for associations with breast cancer risk, stratified by LN and ER status, in European-American (EA) and African-American (AA) women. Two-thousand six hundred and seventy-one women enrolled in the Women's Circle of Health Study were genotyped. Pathway analyses were conducted using the adaptive rank truncated product (ARTP) method, with pARTP â€‰â‰¤â€‰0.10 as significant. Multi-allelic risk scores were created for the ARTP-significant gene(s). Single-SNP and risk score associations were modeled using logistic regression, with false discovery rate (FDR) P-value adjustment. Although single-SNP associations were not significant at pFDR â€‰<â€‰0.05, several genes were significant in the ARTP analyses. In AA women, significant ARTP gene-level associations included CDH1 with LN+ (pARTP â€‰=â€‰0.10; multi-allelic ORâ€‰=â€‰1.13, 95%CI 1.07-1.19, pFDR â€‰=â€‰0.0003) and SIPA1 with ER- breast cancer (pARTP â€‰=â€‰0.10; multi-allelic ORâ€‰=â€‰1.16, 95%CI 1.02-1.31, pFDR â€‰=â€‰0.03). In EA women, MTA2 was associated with overall breast cancer risk (pARTP â€‰=â€‰0.004), regardless of ER status, and with LN- disease (pARTP â€‰=â€‰0.01). Also significant were SATB1 in ER- (pARTP â€‰=â€‰0.03; multi-allelic ORâ€‰=â€‰1.12, 95%CI 1.05-1.20, pFDR â€‰=â€‰0.003) and KISS1 in LN- (pARTP â€‰=â€‰0.10; multi-allelic ORâ€‰=â€‰1.18, 95%CI 1.08-1.29, pFDR â€‰=â€‰0.002) analyses. Among LN+ cases, significant ARTP associations were observed for SNAI1, CD82, NME1, and CTNNB1 (multi-allelic ORâ€‰=â€‰1.09, 95%CI 1.04-1.14, pFDR â€‰=â€‰0.001). Our findings suggest that variants in several metastasis genes may affect breast cancer risk by LN or ER status, although verification in larger studies is required.

73a3515cbcecece18d7159beac71879a4a512cc4,Title Association between genetic polymorphisms and carotid atherosclerosis in patients treated with radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"Background: Radiotherapy (RT) of the neck is commonly given to nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients for preventing cervical lymph node metastasis. However, neck RT may induce the development of carotid atherosclerosis. The mechanisms of radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis are still unclear and no previous study has investigated the genetic involvement of radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis. The present study aims to determine the association between genetic polymorphisms and carotid atherosclerosis in patients treated with RT for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Methods: The present study recruited 128 post-RT NPC patients. Carotid plaque score was assessed using ultrasonography. Thirteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect the function of anti-atherosclerotic genes, including SOD2, SOD3, CAT, PON1, PPARG, ADIPOQ, IL10, TGFB1 and NOS3, were genotyped. Association between the 13 SNPs and carotid atherosclerosis was evaluated using multiple regression after adjustment for covariates (PLINK). Multiple testing was corrected using Benjamini-Hochberg step-up false discovery rate controlling procedure. Results: rs662 and rs705379 of PON1 were close to be significantly associated with carotid plaque score (Corrected P value, Pcor = 0.0528 and Pcor = 0.0842). When the two SNPs were combined together, TC haplotype in rs662-rs705379 of PON1 was significantly associated with higher carotid plaque score (Pcor < 0.05). None of the other SNPs showed significant association with carotid plaque score. Conclusions: TC haplotype in rs662-rs705379 of PON1 is likely to be a genetic risk factor of carotid plaque score.

b4622f4f1a9cdc7bf910aa3bd8ac95c459b212a5,Back to the basics: Rethinking partial correlation network methodology.,"The Gaussian graphical model (GGM) is an increasingly popular technique used in psychology to characterize relationships among observed variables. These relationships are represented as elements in the precision matrix. Standardizing the precision matrix and reversing the sign yields corresponding partial correlations that imply pairwise dependencies in which the effects of all other variables have been controlled for. The graphical lasso (glasso) has emerged as the default estimation method, which uses â„“1 -based regularization. The glasso was developed and optimized for high-dimensional settings where the number of variables (p) exceeds the number of observations (n), which is uncommon in psychological applications. Here we propose to go 'back to the basics', wherein the precision matrix is first estimated with non-regularized maximum likelihood and then Fisher Z transformed confidence intervals are used to determine non-zero relationships. We first show the exact correspondence between the confidence level and specificity, which is due to 1 minus specificity denoting the false positive rate (i.e., Î±). With simulations in low-dimensional settings (pÂ â‰ªÂ n), we then demonstrate superior performance compared to the glasso for detecting the non-zero effects. Further, our results indicate that the glasso is inconsistent for the purpose of model selection and does not control the false discovery rate, whereas the proposed method converges on the true model and directly controls error rates. We end by discussing implications for estimating GGMs in psychology.",2019,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Donald R Williams"", ids = ""46704811""); list(name = ""Philippe Rast"", ids = ""5652893"")",70e8b49577f13fc118900b5e6b83cb29a646df96; abde2b0a2bcfc2e443b974a298f43e8d17081585; 2421f231eb9283c502349dcf85a3f13d07b4f7e3; 37079cfc777e71c46d92f0773d4b8b8ed174c93f; f41b8259b5ff5e07ad473da880c82adb713ba693; d367b960b3d1d534ffb1b9714fe602bbf59b9e68; d5225a2f09dd7f76901121f4a034ef332f64c866; 3140ab017a7efe582bb8c87919c2cd1cec62eb50; 8bf674497f8f0e95d804d71e51260846b8d905ca; 1a9339bd5beb722d60b1eb8e778fc6c89a21b56a,,The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology,,

The purpose of this study is to assess the association between MR perfusion imaging derived parameters and genomic biomarkers of glioblastoma, and to evaluate their prognostic value. This retrospective study enrolled 41 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The mean and maximal relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) ratio (rCBVmean and rCBVmax), derived from MR perfusion weighted imaging, of the enhancing tumor, as well as maximal rCBV ratio of peri-enhancing tumor area (rCBVperi-tumor) were measured. The ki-67 labeling index, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and TP53 were assessed. There was a significant correlation between rCBVmax and mTOR based on Pearsonâ€™s correlations with Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg adjustment for controlling false discovery rate, pâ€‰=â€‰0.047. The rCBVperi-tumor showed significant correlation with mTOR (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0183) after adjustment of gender and EGFR status. The mean rCBVperi-tumor value of the patients with OS shorter than 14 months was significantly higher than patients with OS longer than 14 months, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002. The rCBVperi-tumor and age were the two strongest predictors of OS (hazard ratioâ€‰=â€‰1.29 and 1.063 respectively) by Cox regression analysis. This study showed that hemodynamic abnormalities of glioblastoma were associated with genomics activation status of mTOR-EGFR pathway, however, the radiogenomics associations are different in enhancing and peri-enhancing area of glioblastoma.

In this review the pros and cons of the different technologies presently available for high-throughput measurements of growth rate are discussed. Growth rate can be measured in liquid microcultivation of individual strains, in competition between strains, as growing colonies on agar, as division of individual cells, and estimated from molecular reporters. Irrespective of methodology, statistical issues such as spatial biases and batch effects are crucial to investigate and correct for to ensure low false discovery rates.

However, responses are heterogeneous and resistance to therapy is a pressing clinical problem. With the goal of developing liquid biomarkers to aid in treatment selection, we sought to identify genes associated with resistance to chemotherapy using a circulating tumor cell (CTC)-based approach. METHODS: Whole blood (~5mL) was obtained from 25 patients with mCRPC starting docetaxel (n1â„421) or cabazitaxel (n1â„44). CTCs were isolated using anti-EpCAM-conjugated magnetic beads, and following cell lysis, mRNA was extracted followed by multiplex qRTPCR for 44 prostate cancer-related genes plus internal controls. Gene expression was normalized to controls, and samples were considered CTC-positive based on a previously established set of epithelial markers (EpCAM, EGFR, DSG2, KRT8, KRT18 and KRT19). The primary endpoint was PSA progression-free survival (PFS), with PSA progression defined as an increase of 25% or more above the nadir. Univariable Cox regression analyses were performed to assess for genes associated with PFS at false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.20. RESULTS: Among 25 patients with mCRPC, we identified 84% (21/25) with detectable CTCs. The median age of the cohort was 62 years (IQR 58-70). At a median (IQR) follow up of 5.4 (3.4-9.3) months, 47.6 % (10/21) of patients showed a PSA decrease of at least 30% following treatment initiation. 18/21 patients (85.7%) experienced PSA progression at a median of 2.8 months (IQR 1.7-4.8). In the Cox analysis, KLK2 (HR 2.54, 95%CI 1.24-5.21, p1â„40.011), GAS6 (HR 3.50, 95% CI 1.30-9.42, p1â„40.013), and BMP7 (HR 2.01, 95%CI 1.15-3.52; p1â„40.014) were associated with shorter PFS. CONCLUSIONS: Wehave identified three genes associatedwith progression in mCRPC patients initiating chemotherapy. While these early results need further confirmation, they suggest that CTCs may be utilized to help guide precision-based treatment strategies in patients with mCRPC. Additionally, these results corroborate our recent in vitro and in vivo findings (Lee et al, J Cell Biochem, 2016) indicating that GAS6 protects prostate cancer cells from docetaxel-induced apoptosis.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alvaro RodrÃ­guez"", ids = ""144971068""); list(name = ""Juan Luis GarcÃ­a"", ids = ""145901560""); list(name = ""Javier GarcÃ­a GarcÃ­a"", ids = ""151473934""); list(name = ""R Lozano Mejorada"", ids = ""1556802861""); list(name = ""Irena Misiewicz-Krzeminska"", ids = ""1398681551""); list(name = ""Manuel Herrero Polo"", ids = ""47247741""); list(name = ""Juan JesÃºs Cruz"", ids = ""2798515""); list(name = ""Francisco GÃ³mez Veiga"", ids = ""9844233"")",,,The Journal of Urology,197,e1358
7f44069f780babbbc6de51158828455f9e8473be,Germline variants and advanced colorectal adenomas: adenoma prevention with celecoxib trial genome-wide association study.,"PURPOSE
Identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with development of advanced colorectal adenomas.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Discovery phase: 1,406 Caucasian patients (139 advanced adenoma cases and 1,267 controls) from the Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib (APC) trial were included in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify variants associated with postpolypectomy disease recurrence. Genome-wide significance was defined as false discovery rate less than 0.05, unadjusted P = 7.4 Ã— 10(-7). Validation phase: results were further evaluated using 4,175 familial colorectal adenoma cases and 5,036 controls from patients of European ancestry [COloRectal Gene Identification consortium (CORGI), Scotland, Australia, and VQ58].


RESULTS
Our study identified eight SNPs associated with advanced-adenoma risk in the APC trial (rs2837156, rs7278863, rs2837237, rs2837241, rs2837254, rs741864 at 21q22.2, and rs1381392 and rs17651822 at 3p24.1, at P < 10(-7) level with OR > 2). Five variants in strong pairwise linkage disequilibrium (rs7278863, rs2837237, rs741864, rs741864, and rs2837241; r(2) = 0.8-1) are in or near the coding region for the tight junction adhesion protein, IGSF5. An additional variant associated with advanced adenomas, rs1535989 [minor allele frequency, 0.11; OR, 2.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.50-2.91], also predicted colorectal cancer development in a validation analysis (P = 0.019) using a series of adenoma cases or colorectal cancer (CORGI study) and 3 sets of colorectal cancer cases and controls (Scotland, VQ58, and Australia; N = 9,211).


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that common polymorphisms contribute to the risk of developing advanced adenomas and might also contribute to the risk of developing colorectal cancer.

f80046f9def4d3c76aeb0bbb8632267aa37f5281,DNA methylation levels and long-term trihalomethane exposure in drinking water: an epigenome-wide association study.,"Trihalomethanes (THM) are undesired disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formed during water treatment. Mice exposed to DBPs showed global DNA hypomethylation and c-myc and c-jun gene-specific hypomethylation, while evidence of epigenetic effects in humans is scarce. We explored the association between lifetime THM exposure and DNA methylation through an epigenome-wide association study. We selected 138 population-based controls from a case-control study of colorectal cancer conducted in Barcelona, Spain, exposed to average lifetime THM levels â‰¤85 Î¼g/L vs. >85 Î¼g/L (N = 68 and N = 70, respectively). Mean age of participants was 70 years, and 54% were male. Average lifetime THM level in the exposure groups was 64 and 130 Âµg/L, respectively. DNA was extracted from whole blood and was bisulphite converted to measure DNA methylation levels using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Data preprocessing was performed using RnBeads. Methylation was compared between exposure groups using empirical Bayes moderated linear regression for CpG sites and Gaussian kernel for CpG regions. ConsensusPathDB was used for gene set enrichment. Statistically significant differences in methylation between exposure groups was found in 140 CpG sites and 30 gene-related regions, after false discovery rate <0.05 and adjustment for age, sex, methylation first principal component, and blood cell proportion. The annotated genes were localized to several cancer pathways. Among them, 29 CpGs had methylation levels associated with THM levels (|Î”Î²|â‰¥0.05) located in 11 genes associated with cancer in other studies. Our results suggest that THM exposure may affect DNA methylation in genes related to tumors, including colorectal and bladder cancers.

7c7622ad0e18d148cd28a245e02f8a5f201f626b,High-throughput discovery of rare human nucleotide polymorphisms by Ecotilling,"Human individuals differ from one another at only approximately 0.1% of nucleotide positions, but these single nucleotide differences account for most heritable phenotypic variation. Large-scale efforts to discover and genotype human variation have been limited to common polymorphisms. However, these efforts overlook rare nucleotide changes that may contribute to phenotypic diversity and genetic disorders, including cancer. Thus, there is an increasing need for high-throughput methods to robustly detect rare nucleotide differences. Toward this end, we have adapted the mismatch discovery method known as Ecotilling for the discovery of human single nucleotide polymorphisms. To increase throughput and reduce costs, we developed a universal primer strategy and implemented algorithms for automated band detection. Ecotilling was validated by screening 90 human DNA samples for nucleotide changes in 5 gene targets and by comparing results to public resequencing data. To increase throughput for discovery of rare alleles, we pooled samples 8-fold and found Ecotilling to be efficient relative to resequencing, with a false negative rate of 5% and a false discovery rate of 4%. We identified 28 new rare alleles, including some that are predicted to damage protein function. The detection of rare damaging mutations has implications for models of human disease.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bradley J.

However it applies a common p-value rejection threshold that precludes it from taking advantage of index information of the null hypotheses, making it suboptimal for detecting clustered signals. We propose a double application of the BH procedure on two-level hierarchical and related datasets, the first application to identify p-value batches, and a second application on each identified batch for null hypotheses rejections. We propose a mixture model on two tiers to model signal clustering, and show that on this model, the double application reduces FDR and maintains the power of BH. We show that the doubly applied BH satisfies an average FDR control. Benjamini and Bogomolov (J R Stat Soc Ser B 76:297â€“318, 2014) considered a more general class of procedures and error criterions, and showed average FDR control under dependency assumptions different from ours. Their proof is also technically different. We end the paper with a description of Yekutieliâ€™s (J Am Stat Assoc 103:309â€“316, 2008) procedure on hierarchical datasets, and a proposed hybrid of the double BH procedure and Yekutieliâ€™s procedure that combines the strengths of both.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Qingyun Cai"", ids = ""49652490""); list(name = ""Hock Peng Chan"", ids = ""2591650"")",1f76de31ee01116731d83ded97a595d511c4aa03; 86cec89dce92481167d3caaad4939a5aeec08b38; b874d7d9ace2a43d123ad6b8ded22e4605c83e0e; 88f6387ab2bffd39373af9370886fded9bd8bd21,,Methodology and Computing in Applied Probability,19,429-443
60e296d8ecb6fb4010ca381ecd5cc69d6dde644f,Genetic Markers of Human Evolution Are Enriched in Schizophrenia,"BACKGROUND
Why schizophrenia has accompanied humans throughout our history despite its negative effect on fitness remains an evolutionary enigma. It is proposed that schizophrenia is a by-product of the complex evolution of the human brain and a compromise for humans' language, creative thinking, and cognitive abilities.


METHODS
We analyzed recent large genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia and a range of other human phenotypes (anthropometric measures, cardiovascular disease risk factors, immune-mediated diseases) using a statistical framework that draws on polygenic architecture and ancillary information on genetic variants. We used information from the evolutionary proxy measure called the Neanderthal selective sweep (NSS) score.


RESULTS
Gene loci associated with schizophrenia are significantly (p = 7.30 Ã— 10(-9)) more prevalent in genomic regions that are likely to have undergone recent positive selection in humans (i.e., with a low NSS score). Variants in brain-related genes with a low NSS score confer significantly higher susceptibility than variants in other brain-related genes. The enrichment is strongest for schizophrenia, but we cannot rule out enrichment for other phenotypes. The false discovery rate conditional on the evolutionary proxy points to 27 candidate schizophrenia susceptibility loci, 12 of which are associated with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders or linked to brain development.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that there is a polygenic overlap between schizophrenia and NSS score, a marker of human evolution, which is in line with the hypothesis that the persistence of schizophrenia is related to the evolutionary process of becoming human.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Saurabh Srinivasan"", ids = ""5768948""); list(name = ""Francesco Bettella"", ids = ""2792807""); list(name = ""Morten Mattingsdal"", ids = ""1981687""); list(name = ""Yunpeng Wang"", ids = ""40566190""); list(name = ""Ole Andreas Andreassen"", ids = ""1777021"")",2337efadac5ebb5d225e9607cbe0d075e8a2acbd; 44003a4ef49d554ebc07b96b562048fa45008070; 54d73a5e1dc573d735ba537ac0d670b36d5c1ca7; 80919adc3a8e01e7e5285692d70e0814501f9012; 3afdc0ed9f264df99ef95dd09561eec5198be9c6; 6030fa3f417204d660f624112226e6ad76fe5dc3; 597bcfad5dd4af312ac1cd644b660d4db5916239; 24127e3fe08d38cda31a4af62752463c4450ea47; b57c4e3719251ccc107a29f5cd9a240a24049077; 1f3ae910b786c37304796b2089f8d1a46eab02d4; d7e0a832163dad26785b51062d14473de09407c9; a99d69950f2b3cfe62198876fc3b8d4eaca16408; 352eb711b670b0568d594992e074513264ca956f; aa9aa4d8caaf1f8c685d78458e0192345db51583; 3e24a2e2d9c21341a7f83e30881112f3bf1f2389; 906f19a117a45d67a11e7e164b9406d80be1f021; 936a3c35288f9e1699d9ba0d0ee9e5e3e1342511; 36218ef036d24c4f2b6ed23738e1802abb94d278; 398070a7a9b738ff3a1582ff2aee157e9eab7fd8; 2a84c9c45607d1939e7a92fcb8d82baa5d4e1015; 933be534d8ebb60bf595fd5108cde8248c20adf7; a7e1310574121d9095a67ab2e421fd493816ccdd; 98885b31a5494db52a44f3cbacc7d97525b6fd1c; fec86666a37385223192363f8b912a158a045e8e; e5ac0b1015df6a97494340b30dd331a45add6a8f; 4bb3d305bb8b9dd5ba6227c903a2e16d820844f7; 25c4f42a15ff3ddc2ad398206d8ac1797d70d6d6; 5bf065a6453577b8fb357be0cf3bf008b59ea6df; 69cdb70d47e6ba13fbb55a91c8a7b87231ab5c91; 8176cdecf44c75570c2473c7acf932e8ed532e75; c0e03b2e4d7193553c511fecf969465103e37dd8; 5f063854a964a5992f8f86349bc13e681c453df3; 5642cd70f79cc931aa4d76e8965ef01d0269a518; 55efc83e5be364a62d93204fae60543b77a85feb; 66e4751ea7f233755f04fd3b1dc9244e0a209623; 20843ca6a1b3aa307e1398b2ad3862e4fba75f7a; 4a3a84284b537ff0af6107507e511c2e9cb0f2c8; eabe146132c11e16faef8f4fa1919769eee721e3; a36538f752f922a0d71c9a412a1dc68daf760611; 10ab89ddf8c34f9e01e1b43a5b6c162d89a589a2; 02cfc318b43022d69a417ee5b8b07fb6040cc990,97d7041ca3378045c475cf1069ec3e74130f18e9; 29802defa171a9647279d88a48f984a253521930; 4907a0a044fa02c38f1d96e2c4d539b3406fb181; 7df8343e00e3d09d3b2944643294ddb4b8af1554; 5903301093c7e31d5050404b29ccad8414fc0d29; c58e7c86a854efd8f1527621ab844f7673072261; ef174f7628750f2bd7332a9b09ed72cee06afb0d; 36db6663f3a7793e9cc131bade2e372e38fb7cab; 501a0fb1c4ac1937ceb238883ad6fa433b554727; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; ef2b29c214d146195aab0ca97a333bcf43d81b25; d65023cfc5e433818decc2b0da4a11f85659768d; 85d858b76ea072e326aa4e5a22d9325fc11e8a5a; 8a9dcc30448c4d660abbce058c8ec7d1dba78976; 7dbedbab6eade89cc87b9190bf0ac2c6fee77f54; 87360cb5b549e76f44730028bbe1af2717eed4fe; d67f9b96fd3e4fc0043eb1a4db9901b02c3e5016; fa0950a95426036bc8b8f63f1f56f06685cbb090; 404c1a73884587ee2474408f18b3e80ffb5ed045; 7985772d9363ff5ce22c14a816a8ac9835f2df31; 3c423f11a016b4fd8e170c08cf7dbef20eadb2d7; cd949af827ac0c4d3cb49fe2c895b1cfa7c4accd; e1172bb4f4ff2e3c25fda2e0a1b4be611c7d000d; 3a1311d1bfaee397913dcccd232d462580d0e8d7; 688def26b0c60063e12e5d3237aded7738df2c76; 744986f7ce904543c37cc0fb9a34af6937a2f829; 32c2c29eb0009a2d90f601e9dfb9146fd72b05b8; ea2e7596a9bfc7719261880601ed4bc6c486f1e1; 3bd0484cfc7e48cf85b003779804a5740d545c7f,Biological Psychiatry,80,284-292

A total of 6,382 differentially expressed genes (DEG) at a false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.001 were found throughout lactation. The greatest number of DEG (>3,500 DEG) was observed at 60 and 120 d vs. -30 d with the largest change between consecutive time points observed at -15 vs. 1 d and 120 vs. 240 d. Functional analysis of microarray data was performed using the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA). The DIA analysis of KEGG pathways uncovered as the most impacted and induced 'Galactose metabolism', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis', and 'PPAR signaling'; whereas, 'Antigen processing and presentation' was among the most inhibited. The integrated interpretation of the results suggested an overall increase in metabolism during lactation, particularly synthesis of carbohydrates and lipid. A marked degree of utilization of amino acids as energy source, an increase of protein export, and a decrease of the protein synthesis machinery as well cell cycle also were suggested by the DIA analysis. The DIA analysis of Gene Ontology and other databases uncovered an induction of Golgi apparatus and angiogenesis, and the inhibition of both immune cell activity/migration and chromosome modifications during lactation. All of the highly-impacted and activated functions during lactation were evidently activated at the onset of lactation and inhibited when milk production declined. The overall analysis indicated that the bovine mammary gland relies heavily on a coordinated transcriptional regulation to begin and end lactation. The functional analysis using DIA underscored the importance of genes associated with lactose synthesis, lipid metabolism, protein synthesis, Golgi, transport, cell cycle/death, epigenetic regulation, angiogenesis, and immune function during lactation.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Massimo Bionaz"", ids = ""50559748""); list(name = ""Kathiravan Periasamy"", ids = ""4133990""); list(name = ""Sandra L.

95cdca70f3e6e9a31c435c46c3708821bf0ac921,LabVIEW based robust cascade predictive model for evaluating cancer prognosis,"Abstract Cancer is a disease that is found in many forms. Early diagnosis process significantly affects follow-up of the disease. As in other diseases, it is important to classify the data in cancer cases to determine whether the person belongs to healthy-patient or high-low risk groups. For this purpose, machine learning based on artificial intelligence can be used as a very effective method to follow both the progress and the treatment response process of such diseases and to reveal important features of data sets. In this publication, breast cancer diagnosis was carried out using Principal Component Analysis-Support Vector Machine (PCA-SVM) and proposed parallel Principal Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis-Support Vector Machine (PCA-LDA-SVM) model classifier algorithms, by LabVIEW. LabVIEW, known as Virtual Instrument (VI), is a graphical programming language. The durableness of the used algorithms is analyzed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, rand index, False Positive Rate (FPR), False Discovery Rate (FDR), False Negative Rate (FNR), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) parameters and status detection. The obtained results are compared with each other. After training, of the 140 data used in the test set, 130 were used for the test performance analysis and 10 data were used for the status determination of the newly entered data. Performance analysis has been examined for Polynomial and Gaussian kernel functions. The proposed parallel model provides improvement especially for the Polynomial kernel function. With the proposed model, an increase in classification accuracy was observed in the test phase compared to PCA-SVM, and it was observed that 10 data used for status determination were correctly classified.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Duygu Kaya"", ids = ""87799512""); list(name = ""Mustafa TÃ¼rk"", ids = ""1752714"")",,,Physica A-statistical Mechanics and Its Applications,,123978

To investigate potential relationships between SNPs and acute interstitial lung disease (ILD) events in Japanese non-small-cell lung cancer patients receiving gefitinib.


MATERIALS & METHODS
Japanese non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with gefitinib from a prospective pharmacoepidemiological cohort with a nested case-control study component ('CCS'; 52 ILD cases, 139 controls) and a retrospective study (28 ILD cases, 55 controls) were genotyped for nearly 500,000 SNPs. Associations between genotype and ILD were evaluated using Fisher's exact test and logistic regression modeling, and false discovery rate analysis was used to adjust for the large number of statistical tests.


RESULTS
The CCS data provided some false discovery rate evidence that the significance of top-ranking SNPs exceeded levels expected by chance, suggesting some genuine associations. However, replication analyses using retrospective study data were not supportive and there was little evidence of strong genetic associations from a combined analysis. Adjustment of CCS analyses for clinical variables provided little additional convincing evidence. Significant gene-gene interactions between SNP pairs using CCS data were not confirmed in retrospective study replication analyses.


CONCLUSION
Although it is not possible to exclude genetic influences in ILD etiology, common sequence variation is unlikely to explain a major component of ILD risk. Our top results may provide a useful hypothesis-generating starting point for further research.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Fredrik Nyberg"", ids = ""145055401""); list(name = ""Bryan J Barratt"", ids = ""1394281408""); list(name = ""Taisei Mushiroda"", ids = ""6768123""); list(name = ""Atsushi Takahashi"", ids = ""51140913""); list(name = ""Ansar Jawaid"", ids = ""3681594""); list(name = ""Shuji Hada"", ids = ""46877772""); list(name = ""Takaaki Umemura"", ids = ""28821725""); list(name = ""Masahiro Fukuoka"", ids = ""77316521""); list(name = ""Koichiro Nakata"", ids = ""2034630""); list(name = ""Yuichiro Ohe"", ids = ""5460854""); list(name = ""Harubumi Kato"", ids = ""48704560""); list(name = ""Shoji Kudoh"", ids = ""1810487""); list(name = ""Ruth Macclesfield March"", ids = ""4637207""); list(name = ""Yusuke Nakamura"", ids = ""94316214""); list(name = ""Naoyuki Kamatani"", ids = ""1929006"")",a61193daaf2b9ad07c6a0ce674f57b20cc5c78f8; 2173e686c19fbb478f16a3bbccba65b61f17da8e; 061fca941c8073c8468c791ee68f50d4984290bd; 10d2851ffe8899749aeecffaff86c1c93a9438fe,76c72304669500ef8a3ab673637ebb5a19002eb3; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; e4a148deb71d8ebfeec235210c3b315f60cbc91e; 14d920960fb7ba6f3f1c639da10135bac29015ec; a0818bee828f8c7f41325e94415f1f8e57b43053; b4dc4fc4b5b4b38d51a443682f6c333807b1c727; d951a6dae6b1da1f199b0c6ae11d09a6c191b0c5,Pharmacogenomics,12 7,"

88173ffe7e3253bf146bc9e2c9862b131b60ce88,"Genome-wide association study reveals significant genomic regions for improving yield, adaptability of rice under dry direct seeded cultivation condition","BackgroundPuddled transplanted system of rice cultivation despite having several benefits, is a highly labor, water and energy intensive system. In the face of changing climatic conditions, a successful transition from puddled to dry direct seeded rice (DDSR) cultivation system looks must in future. Genome-wide association study was performed for traits including, roots and nutrient uptake (14 traits), plant-morphological (5 traits), lodging-resistance (4 traits) and yield and yield attributing traits (7 traits) with the aim to identify significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) for traits enhancing rice adaptability to dry direct-seeded rice (DDSR) system.ResultsStudy identified a total of 37 highly significant MTAs for 20 traits. The false discovery rate (FDR) ranged from 0.264 to 3.69â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’â€‰4, 0.0330 to 1.25â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’â€‰4, and 0.0534 to 4.60â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’â€‰6 in 2015WS, 2016DS and combined analysis, respectively. The percent phenotypic variance (PV) explained by SNPs ranged from 9 to 92%. Among the identified significant MTAs, 15 MTAs associated with the traits including nodal root, root hair length, root length density, stem and culm diameter, plant height and grain yield were reported to be located in the proximity of earlier identified candidate gene. The significant positive correlation of grain-yield with seedling establishment traits, root morphological and nutrient-uptake related traits and grain yield attributing traits pointing towards combining target traits to increase rice yield and adaptability under DDSR.

0cdcc79139b4f4823e33a73369ffb30673db836f,Expression of Contactin 4 Is Associated With Malignant Behavior in Pheochromocytomas and Paragangliomas,"Context
Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare neuroendocrine, usually benign, tumors. Currently, the only reliable criterion of malignancy is the presence of metastases.


Objective
The aim of this study was to identify genes associated with malignancy in PPGLs.


Design
Transcriptomic profiling was performed on 40 benign and 11 malignant PPGLs. Genes showing a significantly different expression between benign and malignant PPGLs with a ratio â‰¥4 were confirmed and tested in an independent series by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Immunohistochemistry was performed for the validated genes on 109 benign and 32 malignant PPGLs. Functional assays were performed with hPheo1 cells.


Setting
This study was conducted at the Department of Pathology of the Erasmus MC University Medical Center Rotterdam Human Molecular Genetics laboratory of the de Duve Institute, University of Louvain.


Patients
PPGL samples from 179 patients, diagnosed between 1972 and 2015, were included.


Main outcome measures
Associations between gene expression and malignancy were tested using supervised clustering approaches.


Results
Ten differentially expressed genes were selected based on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression array data. Contactin 4 (CNTN4) was overexpressed in malignant vs benign tumors [4.62-fold; false discovery rate (FDR), 0.001]. Overexpression at the mRNA level was confirmed using qRT-PCR (2.90-fold, P = 0.02; validation set: 4.26-fold, P = 0.005). Consistent findings were obtained in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort (2.7-fold; FDR, 0.02). CNTN4 protein was more frequently expressed in malignant than in benign PPGLs by immunohistochemistry (58% vs 17%; P = 0.002). Survival after 7 days of culture under starvation conditions was significantly enhanced in hPheo1 cells transfected with CNTN4 complementary DNA.


Conclusion
CNTN4 expression is consistently associated with malignant behavior in PPGLs.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lucie Evenepoel"", ids = ""4220034""); list(name = ""Francien H van Nederveen"", ids = ""91971177""); list(name = ""Lindsey Oudijk"", ids = ""5560798""); list(name = ""Thomas G.

c9c6c97066aa05358fbb337c481a0b31dcad26af,Promoter methylation of glucocorticoid receptor gene is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis: A monozygotic twin study.,"OBJECTIVE
Endothelial dysfunction assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is a marker of early atherosclerosis. Glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) regulates many biological processes, including stress response, behavioral, cardiometabolic and immunologic functions. Genetic variants in NR3C1 have been associated with atherosclerosis and related risk factors. This study investigated the association of NR3C1 promoter methylation with FMD, independent of genetic and family-level environmental factors.


METHODS
We studied 84 middle-aged, male-male monozygotic twin pairs recruited from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Brachial artery FMD was measured by ultrasound. DNA methylation levels at 22 CpG residues in the NR3C1 exon 1F promoter region were quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing in genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes. Co-twin control analyses were conducted to examine the association of methylation variation with FMD, adjusting for smoking, physical activity, body mass index, lipids, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and depressive symptoms. Multiple testing was corrected using the false discovery rate.


RESULTS
Mean methylation level across the 22 studied CpG sites was 2.02%. Methylation alterations at 12 out of the 22 CpG residues were significantly associated with FMD. On average, a 1% increase in the intra-pair difference in mean DNA methylation was associated with 2.83% increase in the intra-pair difference in FMD (95% CI: 1.46-4.20; P < 0.0001) after adjusting for risk factors and multiple testing.


CONCLUSION
Methylation variation in NR3C1 exon 1F promoter significantly influences subclinical atherosclerosis, independent of genetic, early family environmental and other risk factors.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jinying Zhao"", ids = ""3306631""); list(name = ""Qiang An"", ids = ""47340120""); list(name = ""Jack M.

8f0c0fb53d3d82cceb1bf6f63a343009c965b551,A Survival Association Study of 102 Polymorphisms Previously Associated with Survival Outcomes in Colorectal Cancer,"Several published studies identified associations of a number of polymorphisms with a variety of survival outcomes in colorectal cancer. In this study, we aimed to explore 102 previously reported common genetic polymorphisms and their associations with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in a colorectal cancer patient cohort from Newfoundland (n = 505). Genotypes were obtained using a genomewide SNP genotyping platform. For each polymorphism, the best possible genetic model was estimated for both overall survival and disease-free survival using a previously published approach. These SNPs were then analyzed under their genetic models by Cox regression method. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed by the False Discovery Rate (FDR) method. Univariate analysis results showed that RRM1-rs12806698, IFNGR1-rs1327474, DDX20-rs197412, and PTGS2-rs5275 polymorphisms were nominally associated with OS or DFS (p < 0.01). In stage-adjusted analysis, the nominal associations of DDX20-rs197412, PTGS2-rs5275, and HSPA5-rs391957 with DFS were detected. However, after FDR correction none of these polymorphisms remained significantly associated with the survival outcomes.

98aa917c648935dd361e8cbda36712d0e3f6756e,A cost-sensitive online learning method for peptide identification,"Post-database search is a key procedure in peptide identification with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) strategies for refining peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) generated by database search engines. Although many statistical and machine learning-based methods have been developed to improve the accuracy of peptide identification, the challenge remains on large-scale datasets and datasets with a distribution of unbalanced PSMs. A more efficient learning strategy is required for improving the accuracy of peptide identification on challenging datasets. While complex learning models have larger power of classification, they may cause overfitting problems and introduce computational complexity on large-scale datasets. Kernel methods map data from the sample space to high dimensional spaces where data relationships can be simplified for modeling. In order to tackle the computational challenge of using the kernel-based learning model for practical peptide identification problems, we present an online learning algorithm, OLCS-Ranker, which iteratively feeds only one training sample into the learning model at each round, and, as a result, the memory requirement for computation is significantly reduced. Meanwhile, we propose a cost-sensitive learning model for OLCS-Ranker by using a larger loss of decoy PSMs than that of target PSMs in the loss function. The new model can reduce its false discovery rate on datasets with a distribution of unbalanced PSMs. Experimental studies show that OLCS-Ranker outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy and stability, especially on datasets with a distribution of unbalanced PSMs. Furthermore, OLCS-Ranker is 15â€“85 times faster than CRanker.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xijun Liang"", ids = ""145474130""); list(name = ""Zhonghang Xia"", ids = ""2237698""); list(name = ""Ling Jian"", ids = ""2227766""); list(name = ""Yongxiang Wang"", ids = list()); list(name = ""Xinnan Niu"", ids = ""35903239""); list(name = ""Andrew J.

e497da628b561b0071a5781d608079d70e32b345,14 CHIPS-Child: Testing the developmental programming hypothesis in the offspring of the CHIPS trial: Randomized trials,"Introduction CHIPS-Child is a follow-up to the international CHIPS trial that showed that â€˜less tightâ€™ (vs. â€˜tightâ€™) control of maternal blood pressure (BP) was associated with no decrease (or increase) in either the primary perinatal outcome (pregnancy loss or high level neonatal care for >48Â h) or measures of fetal growth (in utero). Objectives In CHIPS-Child, we tested the developmental programming hypothesis by determining if children born of mothers in â€˜less tightâ€™ (vs. â€˜tightâ€™) BP control arms of CHIPS showed differences in postnatal growth and health. Methods Follow-up was extended to 12Â Â±Â 2Â months corrected post-gestational age for anthropometric measurements. For CHIPS subjects who consented to a CHIPS-Child study visit, we collected biological samples from the child (hair samples, buccal swabs) to evaluate hypothalamicâ€“pituitaryâ€“adrenal axis (HPA) function (hair cortisol levels) and epigenetic change (DNA methylation analysis of buccal cells). The primary outcome was â€˜change in z-score for weightâ€™ (95% CI) between birth and 12Â Â±Â 2Â months, compared between groups using linear regression adjusted for maternal pre-randomisation factors (hypertension type and centre, antihypertensive type, and maternal body mass index, body mass index [BMI]) (two-tailed pÂ >Â 0.05) and any between-group differences at baseline among babies followed-up. Secondary outcomes were genome-wide and targeted DNA methylation status (from buccal swabs, measured using the Illumina infinium HumanMethylation450 array platform) and hair cortisol (as a measure of hypothalamicâ€“pituitary activation). Results Of 683 eligible CHIPS babies (59 sites), 500 (73.2%) were followed up in CHIPS-Child [244 (70.1%) in â€˜less tightâ€™ vs. 256 (75.7%) in â€˜tightâ€™ control] and 414 consented to participate [196, (80.3%) vs. 218 (85.2%)]. 272 (76.8%) of babies had anthropometry at 12Â Â±Â 2Â months. Babies in â€˜less tightâ€™ (vs. â€˜tightâ€™) probably differed with regards to change in z-score for weight (primary outcome) [âˆ’0.27 (âˆ’0.54, 0.00); pÂ =Â 0.05]; there was no difference in z-scores for length [0.14 (âˆ’0.20, 0.49); pÂ =Â 0.42] or head circumference [0.19 (-0.89, 1.26); pÂ =Â 0.71], or waist circumference (cm) [0.99 (-1.75, 3.72); pÂ =Â 0.45]. Secondary outcomes were measurable only among the babies who were eligible for a study visit (NÂ =Â 92), consented (NÂ =Â 45), and supplied biological samples (NÂ =Â 41). 16 DNA samples (9 vs. 7) passed quality control testing; no difference in DNA methylation was seen based on a false discovery rate >20%. In the 35 adequate hair samples, cortisol levels were significantly lower in â€˜less tightâ€™ (vs. â€˜tightâ€™)[âˆ’496 (âˆ’892, âˆ’100); pÂ =Â 0.02]. Conclusions The results of CHIPS-Child suggest that â€˜tightâ€™ BP control may be associated with both more rapid postnatal growth (birth to age 12Â months) and developmental programming of the HPA axis. These results are limited by small sample size. Longer follow up would be necessary to determine if the findings are associated with important clinical outcomes.

d8ec3589e9b4b7da3c5532fcdfd5e0b01e9aa629,Summary-data-based mendelian randomisation reveals druggable targets for multiple sclerosis,"Background Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a complex autoimmune disease caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Translation of Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) findings in MS into therapeutics and effective preventive strategies has been limited to date. Methods We used Summary Data-Based Mendelian Randomisation (SMR) to synthesise findings from public expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL; eQTLgen and CAGE), methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL; Lothian Birth Cohort and Brisbane Systems Genetics Study), and MS GWAS datasets (International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium). By correlating the effects of methylation on MS (M-2-MS), methylation on expression (M-2-E), and expression on MS susceptibility (E-2-MS), we prioritise genetic loci with strong evidence of causally influencing MS susceptibility. We overlay these findings onto a list of â€˜druggableâ€™ genes, i.e. genes which are currently, or could theoretically, be targeted by therapeutic compounds. We use GeNets and STRING to identify protein-protein interactions and druggable pathways enriched in our results. We extend these findings to a model of Epstein-Barr Virus-infected B cells, Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs). We conducted a systematic review of prioritised genes using the Open Targets platform to identify completed and planned trials targeted prioritised genes in MS and related disease areas. Results Expression of 45 genes in peripheral was strongly associated with MS susceptibility (False discovery rate 0.05). Of these 45 genes, 20 encode a protein which is currently targeted by an existing therapeutic compound. These genes were enriched for Gene Ontology terms pertaining to immune system function and leukocyte signalling. We refined this prioritised gene list by restricting to loci where CpG site methylation was associated with MS susceptibility (M-2-MS), with gene expression (M-2-E), and where expression was associated with MS susceptibility (E-2-MS). This approach yielded a list of 15 prioritised druggable target genes for which there was evidence of a causal pathway linking methylation, expression, and MS. Five of these 15 genes are targeted by existing drugs (CD40, ERBB2, VEGFB, MERTK, and PARP1), and three were replicated in a smaller eQTL dataset (CD40, MERTK, and PARP1). In LCLs, SMR prioritised 7 druggable gene targets, of which only one was priortised by the multi-omic approach in peripheral blood (FCRL3). Systematic review of Open Targets revealed multiple early-phase trials targeting 13/20 prioritised genes in disorders related to MS. Conclusions We use public datasets and SMR to identify a list of prioritised druggable genetic targets in Multiple Sclerosis. We hope our findings could be translated into effective repurposing of existing drugs to provide novel therapies for MS and, potentially, provide a platform for developing preventive therapies.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Benjamin Meir Jacobs"", ids = ""1911337""); list(name = ""Thomas Taylor"", ids = ""144992324""); list(name = ""Amine Awad"", ids = ""10131127""); list(name = ""David Baker"", ids = ""145213302""); list(name = ""Gavin Giovanonni"", ids = ""50102555""); list(name = ""Alastair Noyce"", ids = ""6202875""); list(name = ""Ruth Dobson"", ids = ""40439032"")",,bfd1e24027ff9d5ba9d138b67283fa7b6be2c6c7; 8fa1d139dc9c1368650be0bf8e1f1013e432c24c; c92fe7d641d83f6f02efa30651210557cd6ee5e9; 85fb7950c84686fa5296d33086be12168d4d0055; 262fab7d02a32feca51f230357ed46fa30b2106c; 830fdb7b17cfa7b96693c41f04416c05ccbf34e6; 3388cc059fceb95773013e648dc11e1fe947e96b; aac3fbf407fb30e996f17718cac6ade9a4bc9e60; 57f86b008329b002170757bb3337d1198e02cf22; 53e1bcd4788180e74cf29c47d196992a024e1c1e; 6c49a56f4a3eb69fd53503c50a9ba8deab9f8713; 72eff3dadf096efc5540f5c443718f45525018f8; 34339b453bf10ca35965b18d18229e01bc772105; 909d34e582504ad659a04a6d9dd566a8cc180318; f47654312f89395f27302175be6cab95b001fda0; 6ec8b940c321549e1d723ce20141a322cce92d69; 6c812755fb2d7b1a45488fcc1ec4d58083ccfb16; 9aca97e2529155921e1176ca60db84a722dffd35; 3fa88652d0641507f32191a42b6fb99ea20f2425; e97c82a04cd391222f57d342b114cbd35dd30146; c5ec52be2a66d677829573bae25630c1c1caad97; b1c0ad71873855beed8397dc355f1c5e483a8d5b; 392591704efe37261afacdeaf59c55e4efa07b04; 905ec0aa9e3dd1b86c8ad80596f7615605c8eac8; 57531f575d6b17df2d13e76d4437ffdd7c0aaee8; cbbf40a164125da4c520e4a9b583934169be8204; 328ffc2e64c790a9467503c3ba37cca3f9ab66a7; 58c31ea769b0b395ae53f26078b244af8a83acf1; db2f26905abd869730d6148158f5b0c5e9b944c6; 863c0c2c1e36bb983906d32a984beff199149dd6; 52d33e4ae6f57b32164df8861278c42a82e261cd; 83b7d188922fc2bc83d9d5896eb37972b455b7e6; 7797f42ac5c46d1007dba580d5f80d8cb2aa4820; a382d16095f026a1074ca952c2107c3cdda6389b; 4727a6c866d2f39389fe9fd5d68cece3e5aa0ce2; 49ae16d8a642c6ccdf19f0d707057b5705f04c38; 010f6c47ae78dbf7e9844688a264f0face1f897c; b56db3effe5d8495f60967a0af77743a40c49bc6; 189acf33fe5d51f27b366122e29b603c6f8c6a72; 53a7a77005e93fb884ebad4fb958bc774b97bf9f; 1b6d2c08e5b0b7ec50366b0175d266ed37ab7d77,bioRxiv,,

We construct a new statistic based on a truncated estimator of the unknown transformation functions, together with a bias-corrected sample covariance. Furthermore, we show that the new test statistic converges to the same distribution as its oracle counterpart does. Both synthetic data and real cancer genomic data are used to illustrate the promise of the new method.

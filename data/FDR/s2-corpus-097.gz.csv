889ef0fb69ec014c9a3fcd84ffd1c72992a30975,Search for astrophysical high energy neutrino point sources with a False Discovery Rate controlling procedure,"A systematic multiple hypothesis testing approach is applied to the search for astrophysical sources of high energy neutrinos. The method is based on the maximisation of the detection power maintaining the control of the confidence level of an hypothetical discovery. This is achieved by using the so-called ""False Discovery Rate"" (FDR) controlling procedure. It has the advantage to be independent of the signal modelling and to naturally take into account the trial factor. Moreover it is well suited to the detection of multiple sources.",2010,Physics,"list(name = ""Bruny Baret"", ids = ""48092066""); list(name = ""Mathieu Labare"", ids = ""3425387""); list(name = ""Daniel Bertrand"", ids = ""145864656"")",,e6284002686ce41ea036252de4d4f12b33d5417a; 6ebef57fd8a6e66b8af9594deae55f86543683dd,arXiv: Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,
e0410d41eb9204b338d02bc0d083b8bf39d6c681,Replication of genomewide associations with allergic sensitization and allergic rhinitis.,"BACKGROUND
Three genomewide metastudies have recently reported associations with self-reported allergic rhinitis and allergic sensitization. The three studies together identified a set of 37 loci but showed low concordance. This study investigates the reproducibility of the detected single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations in an extensively characterized longitudinal cohort, BAMSE.


METHODS
Phenotypic evaluation of allergic rhinitis (AR) and allergic sensitization was performed on 2153 children from BAMSE at 8 and 16 years of age. Allele frequencies of 39 SNPs were investigated for association with the exact allergic phenotypes of the metastudies. Odds ratios and false discovery rates were calculated, and the impact of asthma was evaluated. The cases were also evaluated for age at onset effects (â‰¤ or >8 years of age).


RESULTS
Association tests of the 39 SNPs identified 12 SNPs with P-values < 0.05 and Q-values < 0.10. Two of the four loci (TLR6-TLR1 and HLA-DQA1-HLA-DQB1) identified in all three original studies were also identified in this study. Three SNPs located in the TLR6-TLR1 locus had the lowest P-values and Q-values < 0.1 when using a well-defined AR phenotype. Two loci showed significant age at onset effects, but the effect of asthma on the associations was very limited.


CONCLUSION
The TLR6-TLR1 locus is likely to have a central role in the development of allergic disease. The association between genetic variation in the SSTR1-MIPOL1 and TSLP-SLC25A46 loci and age at onset is the first report of age at onset effects in allergic rhinitis.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Diana Nilsson"", ids = ""113075638""); list(name = ""V Henmyr"", ids = ""3960834""); list(name = ""Christer HalldÃ©n"", ids = ""4932819""); list(name = ""TorbjÃ¶rn SÃ¤ll"", ids = ""4524794""); list(name = ""Inger Kull"", ids = ""3556407""); list(name = ""Magnus Wickman"", ids = ""3935800""); list(name = ""Erik MelÃ©n"", ids = ""3749116""); list(name = ""Lars Olaf Cardell"", ids = ""153604842"")",df0e4e1964d36ca793496d9ac5eb7b374568a91a; 041e0cf2030be9f9246cba473a3e6d9cc530995e; 86cd72fcdb253ccdea430285bee5387e933ff45d; c070d0b2df16a1c9d449c8e0994d6fdd81acac40; f3dce274857de6768988960d7673756d2d631d09; b0bb391d6b8a3e267cd9c3ec51381562cb7f4805; a0efdc13dfc72f2763eb78e443134f43ac719c41; 682b33c554ddda32ac334891d0d2ddda9ff9622c; be2843f6f6d0e4ae09dd6001b776430d4223aa24; 587c45e53df2dd463f6c828ca4948dea0be77fd5; 552fefc060e6dee04279d87d448a8933037e6c4d; 7eefbffb73c20560e2857e0b5daaeede9e2bd13a; c23bef1b0f96d4404def54a2b172b9e6d182ebb6,,Allergy,69 11,"

485758ad5ed70db93970bc7cdf32ac10eb2a9a09,The transcriptome of cervical ripening in human pregnancy before the onset of labor at term: identification of novel molecular functions involved in this process.,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to identify changes in the cervical transcriptome in the human uterine cervix as a function of ripening before the onset of labor.


STUDY DESIGN
Human cervical tissue was obtained from women at term not in labor with ripe (n = 11) and unripe (n = 11) cervices and profiled using Affymetrix GeneChip HGU133Plus2.0 arrays. Gene expression was analyzed using a moderated t-test (False Discovery Rate 5%). Gene ontology and pathway analysis were performed. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used for confirmation of selected differentially expressed genes.


RESULTS
(1) Ninety-one genes were differentially expressed between ripe and unripe groups. (2) Cervical ripening was associated with enrichment of specific biological processes (e.g. cell adhesion, regulation of anatomical structure), pathways and 11 molecular functions (e.g. extracelluar matrix (ECM)-structural constituent, protein binding, glycosaminoglycan binding). (3) qRT-PCR confirmed that 9 of 11 tested differentially expressed genes (determined by microarray) were upregulated in a ripe cervix (e.g. MYOCD, VCAN, THBS1, COL5A1). (4) Twenty-three additional genes related to ECM metabolism and adhesion molecules were differentially regulated (by qRT-PCR) in ripe cervices.


CONCLUSION
(1) This is the first description of the changes in the human cervical transcriptome with ripening before the onset of labor. (2) Biological processes, pathways and molecular functions were identified with the use of this unbiased approach. (3) In contrast to cervical dilation after term labor, inflammation-related genes did not emerge as differentially regulated with cervical ripening. (4) Myocardin was identified as a novel gene upregulated in human cervical ripening.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sonia S.

However, early applications of microarray technology have identified relatively small groups of responding genes with which to define new targets for analysis by conventional means. We have trialled a more intensive approach to the design and interpretation of array experiments incorporating a balanced interwoven ANOVA design with higher levels of biological replication, a more thorough analysis of errors and false discovery rates, and an analysis of response patterns using gene network models. Zebrafish embryos were exposed from 1.5 h post-fertilization for 72 h to ecotoxicants representing different classes--2,4-dichlorophenol, 3,4-dichloroaniline, pentachlorophenol, and cadmium chloride--at low concentrations producing a developmental disturbance to 10% of embryos and half of this dose. Extracted whole embryo RNA was then analyzed on microarrays. Analysis revealed responses of 3000-5000 genes, which is 10-1000 times greater than previously reported, with significance at lower levels of fold change. Some gene responses were common to multiple toxicants, and others were restricted to just one or two toxicants. The gene expression profiles for the different toxicants were distinctive, and analysis using network-based models provided a high level of detail of affected processes, some of which were novel. This approach provides a more highly refined view of toxic effects, from which meaningful patterns of response can be discerned and related to functional deficits and from which more reliable indicators of toxicological effect can be predicted.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ashley D.

8c5741ec7f3f623b5df8996175552655cbb17451,Gene expression variation in the adult human retina.,"Despite evidence that differences in gene expression levels contribute significantly to phenotypic variation across individuals, there has been only limited effort to study gene expression variation in human tissue. To characterize expression variation in the normal human retina, we utilized a custom retinal microarray to analyze 33 normal retinas from 19 donors, aged 29-90 years. Statistical models were designed to separate and quantify biological and technical sources of variation, including age, gender, eye laterality, gene function and age-by-gender interaction. Although the majority of the 9406 genes analyzed showed relatively stable expression levels across different donors (for an average gene the expression level value of 95 out of a 100 individuals fell within a 1.23-fold range), 2.6% of genes showed significant donor-to-donor variation, with a false discovery rate of 10%. The mean expression ratio standard deviation was 0.15+/-0.8, log2, with a range of 0.09-0.99. Genes selectively expressed in photoreceptors showed higher expression variation than other gene classes. Gender, age and other donor-specific factors contributed significantly to the expression variation of multiple genes, and groups of genes with an age- and gender-associated expression pattern were identified. Our findings show that a significant fraction of gene expression variation in the normal human retina is attributable to identifiable biological factors. The greater expression variability of many genes central to retinal function (including photoreceptor-specific genes) may be partially explained by the dynamics of the vision process, and raises the possibility that photoreceptor gene expression levels may contribute to phenotypic diversity across normal adult retinas. In addition, as such diversity may result in different levels of disease susceptibility, exploring its sources may provide insights into the pathogenesis of retinal disease.",2003,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Itay Chowers"", ids = ""32099688""); list(name = ""Dongmei Liu"", ids = ""145159708""); list(name = ""Ronald H.

d2046edbc0eb08a760884bedc9469036ad525b2a,SULT1E1 Genetic Polymorphisms Modified the Association between Phytoestrogen Consumption and Bone Mineral Density in Healthy Korean Women,"Sulfotransferase 1E1 (SULT1E1) catalyze estrogen into sulfate conjugation and is involved in the metabolism of phytoestrogen. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 397 Korean women, to evaluate the association between genetic polymorphisms of SULT1E1 and bone mineral density (BMD) and the combined effect of the genetic polymorphism and phytoestrogen intake for BMD in Korean women. BMDs of the distal radius and the calcaneus were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Genotypes of SULT1E1IVS1-447 C>A, IVS4-1653 T>C, and *959 G>A were determined by the 5â€²-nuclease assay (TaqMan). Phytoestrogen intake was estimated by a food-frequency questionnaire validated against multiple 24-hour recalls. Women with the SULT1E1*959 GG genotype had a 4.5% lower BMD at the distal radius (Ptrend = 0.05) and a 7.9% lower BMD at the calcaneus compared to those with AA genotype (Ptrend < 0.01), whereas the SULT1E1IVS1-447 CC genotype and IVS4-1653 TT genotype were not associated with BMD. There was no significant trend of BMD with the numbers of CTG-containing haplotypes, but calcaneal BMDs significantly differed between SULT1E1CTA-CTA haplotype and CTG-CCA haplotype (P < 0.05). When stratified by SULT1E1 genotype, the correlation between phytoestrogen consumption and BMD at the calcaneus was noteworthy in women with SULT1E1*959 GG genotype (r = 0.25, P = 0.01) or SULT1E1IVS 4-1653 TT genotype (r = 0.15, P = 0.02). This trend remained significant only in postmenopausal women (r = 0.36, P = 0.01) after multiple testing was corrected by the false discovery rate method.

d6af521ccbf5ad2b50a4f65a81c9a6b83fb7e127,Transcriptional responses to thermal acclimation in the eurythermal fish Gillichthys mirabilis (Cooper 1864).,"Thermal acclimation (acclimatization) capacity may be critical for determining how successfully an ectotherm can respond to temperature change, and adaptive shifts in gene expression may be pivotal for mediating these acclimatory responses. Using a cDNA microarray, we examined transcriptional profiles in gill tissue of a highly eurythermal goby fish, Gillichthys mirabilis, following 4 wk of acclimation to 9 degrees C, 19 degrees C, or 28 degrees C. Overall, gill transcriptomes were not strikingly different among acclimation groups. Of the 1,607 unique annotated genes on the array, only 150 of these genes (9%) were significantly different in expression among the three acclimation groups (ANOVA, false discovery rate < 0.05). Principal component analysis revealed that 59% of the variation in expression among these genes was described by an expression profile that is upregulated with increasing acclimation temperature. Gene ontology analysis of these genes identified protein biosynthesis, transport, and several metabolic categories as processes showing the greatest change in expression. Our results suggest that energetic costs of macromolecular turnover and membrane-localized transport rise with acclimation temperature. The upregulation of several classes of stress-related proteins, e.g., heat shock proteins, seen in the species' response to acute thermal stress was not observed in the long-term 28 degrees C-acclimated fish. The transcriptional differences found among the acclimation groups thus may reflect an acclimation process that has largely remedied the effects of acute thermal stress and established a new steady-state condition involving changes in relative energy costs for different processes. This pattern of transcriptional alteration in steady-state acclimated fish may be a signature of eurythermy.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Cheryl A.

5a400b9bfb7dec3513db5737fa30356a39d3c33b,Auditory verbal hallucinations are related to cortical thinning in the left middle temporal gyrus of patients with schizophrenia.,"BACKGROUND
Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) are one of the most common and severe symptoms of schizophrenia, but the neuroanatomical abnormalities underlying AVHs are not well understood. The present study aims to investigate whether AVHs are associated with cortical thinning.


METHODS
Participants were schizophrenia patients from four centers across China, 115 with AVHs and 93 without AVHs, as well as 261 healthy controls. All received 3 T T1-weighted brain scans, and whole brain vertex-wise cortical thickness was compared across groups. Correlations between AVH severity and cortical thickness were also determined.


RESULTS
The left middle part of the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) was significantly thinner in schizophrenia patients with AVHs than in patients without AVHs and healthy controls. Inferences were made using a false discovery rate approach with a threshold at p < 0.05. Left MTG thickness did not differ between patients without AVHs and controls. These results were replicated by a meta-analysis showing them to be consistent across the four centers.

b037b7e4e4eb539778170991dedd249302c7fd20,Genome-Wide Association of Immunoglobulin G Concentration in Colostrum and Milk of Holstein Cattle,"Dairy cows classified as high immune responders, have inherently enhanced concentrations of total immunoglobulin G (IgG), and antibodies (antigen-specific immunoglobulin) in their colostrum and milk compared to average and low immune responders. FcRn (Fc receptor neonatal), a specialized receptor in the mammary tissue aids in the transport of circulating IgG from the blood of the dam into colostrum and the subsequent uptake of IgG from the digestive tract of calves into the systemic circulation. The present study was conducted to identify autosomal genomic regions associated with total IgG in colostrum and milk using a 50K SNP panel with imputation to the high-density panel (777K) and 556,279 markers were included in a genome wide association study (GWAS). SNP markers on chromosomes 12 (at ~60-65 Mb) and 15 (at ~44-46 Mb), were found to be significantly associated with total IgG concentration in milk at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) level. No significant associations in colostrum or milk were found between total IgG and SNPs in the gene region encoding FcRn. However, raw p-value (without FDR adjustment), for 2 SNPs located within the FCGRT gene region on chromosome 18 were shown to be significant at the 5% level for colostrum. One limitation of this study was the small number of animals tested (n=57), which will affect the power of the GWAS. Further evaluation of these SNPs with a larger sample size, and of their associated candidate genes and their biological pathways, is required to understand the genetics of development of high IgG concentrations in colostrum and milk.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Lauraine C.

To understand more clearly the extracellular milieu associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we employed a bioassay whereby plasma of treatment naive paediatric IBD patients (nÂ =Â 22 CD, nÂ =Â 15 UC) and unrelated healthy controls (uHC, nÂ =Â 10) were used to induce transcriptional responses in a healthy leucocyte population. After culture, gene expression was measured comprehensively with microarrays and analysed. Relative to uHC, plasma of CD and UC patients induced distinct responses consisting, respectively, of 985 and 895 regulated transcripts [|log2 ratio| â‰¥Â 0Â·5 (1Â·4-fold); false discovery rates (FDR) â‰¤Â 0Â·01]. The CD:uHC and UC:uHC signatures shared a non-random, commonly regulated, intersection of 656 transcripts (Ï‡(2) Â =Â PÂ <Â 0Â·001) and were highly correlative [Pearson's correlation coefficientÂ =Â 0Â·96, 95% confidence interval (CI)Â =Â 0.96, 0.97]. Despite sharing common genetic susceptibility loci, the IBD signature correlated negatively with that driven by plasma of type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients (Pearson's correlation coefficientÂ =Â -0Â·51). Ontological analyses revealed the presence of an immunoregulatory plasma milieu in IBD, as transcripts for cytokines/chemokines, receptors and signalling molecules consistent with immune activation were under-expressed relative to uHC and T1D plasma. Multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and receptor blockade studies confirmed transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î² and interleukin (IL)-10 as contributors to the IBD signature. Analysis of CD patient signatures detected a subset of transcripts associated with responsiveness to 6-mercaptopurine treatment. Through plasma-induced signature analysis, we have defined a unique, partially TGF-Î²/IL-10-dependent immunoregulatory signature associated with IBD that may prove useful in predicting therapeutic responsiveness.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bhaskar Gurram"", ids = ""9141597""); list(name = ""Nita H.

697a3be25a4a1324b016acef202b23cb73cc8636,Quantitative phosphoproteomics of Alzheimer's disease reveals cross-talk between kinases and small heat shock proteins.,"Abnormal phosphorylation contributes to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but may play other signaling roles during AD pathogenesis. In this study, we employed IMAC followed by LC-MS/MS to identify phosphopeptides from eight individual AD and eight age-matched control postmortem human brain tissues. Using this approach, we identified 5569 phosphopeptides in frontal cortex across all 16 cases in which phosphopeptides represented 80% of all peptide spectral counts collected following IMAC enrichment. Marker selection identified 253 significantly altered phosphopeptides by precursor intensity, changed by at least 1.75-fold relative to controls, with an empirical false discovery rate below 7%. Approximately 21% of all significantly altered phosphopeptides in AD tissue were derived from tau. Of the other 142 proteins hyperphosphorylated in AD, membrane, synapse, cell junction, and alternatively spliced proteins were overrepresented. Of these, we validated differential phosphorylation of HSP 27 (HSPB1) and crystallin-alpha-B (CRYAB) as hyperphosphorylated by Western blotting. We further identified a network of phosphorylated kinases, which coenriched with phosphorylated small HSPs. This supports a hypothesis that a number of kinases are regulating and/or regulated by the small HSP folding network.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Eric B.

5432bc6830cd5a02673bdb5d08c5d72298972720,DNA methylation associated with postpartum depressive symptoms overlaps findings from a genome-wide association meta-analysis of depression,"BackgroundPerinatal depressive symptoms have been linked to adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. The etiology associated with perinatal depressive psychopathology is poorly understood, but accumulating evidence suggests that understanding inter-individual differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) patterning may provide insight regarding the genomic regions salient to the risk liability of perinatal depressive psychopathology.ResultsGenome-wide DNAm was measured in maternal peripheral blood using the Infinium MethylationEPIC microarray. Ninety-two participants (46% African-American) had DNAm samples that passed all quality control metrics, and all participants were within 7 months of delivery. Linear models were constructed to identify differentially methylated sites and regions, and permutation testing was utilized to assess significance. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were defined as genomic regions of consistent DNAm change with at least two probes within 1â€‰kb of each other. Maternal age, current smoking status, estimated cell-type proportions, ancestry-relevant principal components, days since delivery, and chip position served as covariates to adjust for technical and biological factors. Current postpartum depressive symptoms were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Ninety-eight DMRs were significant (false discovery rate < 5%) and overlapped 92 genes. Three of the regions overlap loci from the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium meta-analysis of depression.ConclusionsMany of the genes identified in this analysis corroborate previous allelic, transcriptomic, and DNAm association results related to depressive phenotypes. Future work should integrate data from multi-omic platforms to understand the functional relevance of these DMRs and refine DNAm association results by limiting phenotypic heterogeneity and clarifying if DNAm differences relate to the timing of onset, severity, duration of perinatal mental health outcomes of the current pregnancy or to previous history of depressive psychopathology.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dana M Lapato"", ids = ""14174746""); list(name = ""Roxann Roberson-Nay"", ids = ""1399022587""); list(name = ""Robert M.

6bda45e7f882fc3c0c6a64e5ed07084404f5dcc8,Genomic expression analysis of rat chromosome 4 for skeletal traits at femoral neck.,"Hip fracture is the most devastating osteoporotic fracture type with significant morbidity and mortality. Several studies in humans and animal models identified chromosomal regions linked to hip size and bone mass. Previously, we identified that the region of 4q21-q41 on rat chromosome (Chr) 4 harbors multiple femoral neck quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in inbred Fischer 344 (F344) and Lewis (LEW) rats. The purpose of this study is to identify the candidate genes for femoral neck structure and density by correlating gene expression in the proximal femur with the femoral neck phenotypes linked to the QTLs on Chr 4. RNA was extracted from proximal femora of 4-wk-old rats from F344 and LEW strains, and two other strains, Copenhagen 2331 and Dark Agouti, were used as a negative control. Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 arrays. A total of 99 genes in the 4q21-q41 region were differentially expressed (P < 0.05) among all strains of rats with a false discovery rate <10%. These 99 genes were then ranked based on the strength of correlation between femoral neck phenotypes measured in F2 animals, homozygous for a particular strain's allele at the Chr 4 QTL and the expression level of the gene in that strain. A total of 18 candidate genes were strongly correlated (r(2) > 0.50) with femoral neck width and prioritized for further analysis. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed 14 of 18 of the candidate genes. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed several direct or indirect relationships among the candidate genes related to angiogenesis (VEGF), bone growth (FGF2), bone formation (IGF2 and IGF2BP3), and resorption (TNF). This study provides a shortened list of genetic determinants of skeletal traits at the hip and may lead to novel approaches for prevention and treatment of hip fracture.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Imranul Alam"", ids = ""3770319""); list(name = ""Qiwei Sun"", ids = ""1840463""); list(name = ""Lixiang Liu"", ids = ""46458330""); list(name = ""Daniel L.

This article introduces MMCTest , a sequential algorithm that gives, with arbitrarily high probability, the same classification as a specific multiple testing procedure applied to ideal p-values. The method can be used with a class of multiple testing procedures that include the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate procedure and the Bonferroni correction controlling the familywise error rate. One of the key features of the algorithm is that it stops sampling for all the hypotheses that can already be decided as being rejected or non-rejected. MMCTest can be interrupted at any stage and then returns three sets of hypotheses: the rejected, the non-rejected and the undecided hypotheses. A simulation study motivated by actual biological data shows that MMCTest is usable in practice and that, despite the additional guarantee, it can be computationally more efficient than other methods.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Axel Gandy"", ids = ""2559159""); list(name = ""Georg Hahn"", ids = ""47969459"")",68d74b70efc0b29d9d797ee602e7ad875aad0ef1; 257a78906b3dcc71a8b4c0347186dfa4c58e4b4c; d8eade3da507e2a0341998da4d510652f299e0fa; 30164f63203a0805716c8fc70f65a24cbd32532e; 491109817a93f367ccaf78e11c62af9a5bed93f6; 7809664799f01b300241ac9239057a883e81670d; 7073532146085d0a576f8bbb27199dc508fcc50f; 08e51ddefcbf18ac0fcab02381f035291491d441; 937b8357958523ace253e0088deec5bc6b3bda01; eabe6a2d66eab15e79d714b075e34a710ecb473e; 77fa5c87b6b6820c4e1553f8613fe54576abbf46; f795b32f00f2174506642b4d5bbcc2ab4bfae820; 89c3a79c4a3395e0278ae6fd32b4167359630658; 459cf61245efeace87c15c9bed0d26a61b6eb0ea,fb340df4b3e423eedb1e18f01d5952070ee5c1e4; 2460f0ffb658311d242fe97e120dadc5d7ac138d; 1973f94f357cbffa8e845c7e13e630382c1d83e7; 6e05c1896f79d86f6ffe6dad18831c2a330f9c4c; 06b43caa6a1a0281a728c011f1dbde237f6317a3; da571e9cc5e1d067e9848da6a235558926f4f46f; 5d33df966768d1c3a54093b2a005d7e84eb2ae1c; e8542266d7f8d8657dd9548aa2fd3f019fe0f303; 4e6d94ad1b35a33be39e9cb14fc1fa997d6df047; 166c42895882039e4252f7c943efa13d0505109f; bd53ebf7e28d0ee4d6904be1875c5a931d5b28bf; 40921752bcf861206a4475b38d4fd80a529061a8; 6b23ddca8f44814bea93803d9ffb5279a5d6902c; 8a152bd2e5d4dafb5a1f1131890415016bc969e2; d7203a27edddacbc573a29754bc192f7bedecaca; 0b3a2cb047d609884ce40b1b98994555d5a277e6; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c2c60a5d08d3a1ea7273e04ea28116735be479c4; c66db9b93d75c0ff52e7f84605b8389345307006; 630f83ae36b952105b0d4f4bc47a5958ae20d8ef; 81e2fd87effcb34ba2fca6217e6e25da86015b88; 18f677e5ee3f15a5531f45052a2bc78c15a800a4; abfc96a20664be5f3c3696b079290c20127f0ad8; e3d7f293b1411dad7699df89ccb64842c50544f1; cace6ba406d23051f221036b8a03843ef9e7405c; 9a1d425ad83c958a57fb54978bf67e4d1106441a; e1c3d237bb05db27b39f80e584bd16779514ee5c,Scandinavian Journal of Statistics,41,1083-1101

The pathophysiology of cerebral aneurysm formation remains to be elucidated. Estrogen is thought to be protective against the development of aneurysms. The aim of this study is to identify differentially expressed genes in the estrogen receptor pathway that may be linked to the development of cerebral aneurysms.


METHODS
Data from 6 Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases with gene expression profiles of cerebral aneurysm tissue were analyzed (GSE6551, GSE15629, GSE26969, GSE46337, GSE54083, and GSE75436). Ninety-four genes associated with the estrogen receptor pathway were identified from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model was used to evaluate the association of the estrogen receptor pathway genes with aneurysm formation.


RESULTS
Four genes related to the estrogen receptor pathway were significantly associated with intracranial aneurysms, 2 of which were downregulated (PIK3R1: fold change [FC]Â = 0.41, false discovery rate [FDR]Â = 6.1Â Ã— 10-5, ADCY9: FCÂ = 0.55, FDRÂ = 2.3Â Ã— 10-4) and 2 of which were upregulated (HBEGF: FCÂ = 1.46, FDRÂ = 4.9Â Ã— 10-4; ADCY7: FCÂ = 2.11, FDRÂ = 6.0Â Ã— 10-3). Furthermore, subgroup analysis of 2 GEO databases with information provided about sex demonstrated PIK3R1 to be significant independently in both men (FCÂ = 0.46, FDRÂ = 6.3Â Ã— 10-5) and women (FCÂ = 0.46, FDRÂ = 2.3Â Ã— 10-4), whereas JUN, ADCY5, and MMP9 were significant in women only.


CONCLUSIONS
The analysis of 6 GEO databases revealed 4 differentially expressed genes (PIK3R1, HBEGF, ADCY7, and ADCY9) in cerebral aneurysm tissue that are associated with the estrogen receptor pathway. Further analysis of estrogen-associated differentially expressed genes may provide information about the protective effects of estrogen on cerebral aneurysm development.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Pui Man Rosalind Lai"", ids = ""145199083""); list(name = ""Rose Du"", ids = ""145591974"")",,,World neurosurgery,,
c4465436014be9baae12aeee01880ff4c9571e8a,False discovery rate controlling procedures for discrete tests,"Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) proposed the false discovery rate (FDR) as an alternative to the family-wise error rate in multiple testing problems, and proposed a procedure to control the FDR. For discrete data this procedure may be highly conservative.

a636b4eb5acd41f20903abec0b870a3233ff60d9,Alterations in resting-state gamma activity in patients with schizophrenia: a high-density EEG study,"Alterations of EEG gamma activity in schizophrenia have been reported during sensory and cognitive tasks, but it remains unclear whether changes are present in resting state. Our aim was to examine whether changes occur in resting state, and to delineate those brain regions where gamma activity is altered. Furthermore, we wanted to identify the associations between changes in gamma activity and psychopathological characteristics. We studied gamma activity (30â€“48Â Hz) in 60 patients with schizophrenia and 76 healthy controls. EEGs were acquired in resting state with closed eyes using a high-density, 256-channel EEG-system. The two groups were compared in absolute power measures in the gamma frequency range. Compared to controls, in patients with schizophrenia the absolute power was significantly elevated (false discovery rate corrected pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). The alterations clustered into fronto-central and posterior brain regions, and were positively associated with the severity of psychopathology, measured by the PANSS. Changes in gamma activity can lead to disturbed coordination of large-scale brain networks. Thus, the increased gamma activity in certain brain regions that we found may result in disturbances in temporal coordination of task-free/resting-state networks in schizophrenia. Positive association of increased gamma power with psychopathology suggests that altered gamma activity provides a contribution to symptom presentation.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""MÃ¡tÃ© Baradits"", ids = ""40772009""); list(name = ""Brigitta Kakuszi"", ids = ""3950701""); list(name = ""SÃ¡ra BÃ¡lint"", ids = ""40602923""); list(name = ""MÃ¡tÃ© FullajtÃ¡r"", ids = ""7311732""); list(name = ""LÃ¡szlÃ³ BalÃ¡zs MÃ³d"", ids = ""48252544""); list(name = ""IstvÃ¡n Bitter"", ids = ""3220158""); list(name = ""PÃ¡l Czobor"", ids = ""3208294"")",bfe4b063a48bb504af05ab69f265616060dbfc2b; 7bdca3275207eee7a30e5c2f14b90e75040abb57; 2be6c8b512c0fc8b76052de321cf47de32d020dd; 7b7db786e5fd828ff5771bddcb10f144dcb86759; 5da6d25c33e30e4b5690e17744ba1bfd110be44b; 219143f9b0e94b6f6ff3469e5a848944720d4e0b,452b7a89620dc334e513f2786e9f489127b19399; e489a1882989fb666f1ac901998034205739021d; 06ed74c6e5ac947017aaa2ebbbaff320b4dd5f27; fc011508306f30732f7c0db97a1d944135367b1d; 8a23e918cdd739289ae0f20faa1c83ab8da64f82; c3ba06040dd711aadad7b852c37db78739ab9e12; fd27e97826b8a3ec805994e7a710429de6a29e46; e0372337abb00bb2d32755ed72df468c48084fda; c8f12cb6a161de5d8fe2dc4d154f1763cae33ead; 548a7ad9a5c9b6ac958d7a7afdda7cc6c4f5dc77; ac9cc5dd3054b63529d5b016e8c9545471a83b2a; 4fdaa3e3e86c8fe46240311c577e048fd86797aa; 89a4eae3a483333c1852609e786ada50061e103e; 8ab58da6e4bb24c92af5ea4b11b999daec0ba410; 975eb7727695dd01bef389cb3cd2d5193459212e; 09bca1714364098bb79e10348a1a9f78c7b5db84; 302f9a9f34d5bbddf32ce428829c5bcdf17640b2; 9701f5be9f208bdb927afa8d011b01b989f5ec76; b8bf4cf402ba5f2ba981a79a378002cc82db3274; fe46bf2315d55a2965b4737e3e3a096a71c5ba92; 02a1cdaa496fb4127a48b6e4f2aa14bbd413d75d; 8add56963ea1d979efd074d72832f17cc0513002; f89e2bdb74243285312e53383880c36a069f963c; eeabea88d46333c43d946add20ca5536f51e5d3c; f917a6ce7f5d8519fdb9d9540b1838a42d105479; ee7b4cb547036f66c97407776de547ebf617e9ed; 6866fe029d3d85868a2704b1c17125a1fb16b954; 5317c8cc28f1ac51f837731c3a1f0217d443d6a0; 3934bf9afe91d6cf00b5086d36a4c50628afd0f3; a8435770b802a770eb5efc98a0baadcad4affa12; 77008359579e6b0d468a6fd7d835014cdb3e0e72; da2741bf809a04105c7c22ac3864e64969d9e37f; 9b3476aaca36a3e7a4562414267fb9fe069009b8; 6683785e98ff5704c0ba45d0bef00d5b7e6ae47c; 9f4af812d01a3b04ab8308f7df037c03409ca5e8; 90cf745e44e71c422fa7a6afa8497dd26b44452b; e9e261a586d9524b07d2e99dd1c801155e090cf8; 55b3b8bacbf8c6e019caa8401549bb03751c42ee; efaaa8ac6cee72b76e85a32f01e34395934dc761; 05a20ed184d382150d0dd15cfc5e61a22399a7d7; d7fb12390317e4a5bbb900487014f0aaeef01bc6; f1c9fd0290b3d6a291b2b9394d3fe38c6a02894d; 0202d3e1f1476150c111b4190fab8f21ce2f2185; edd455913ade9993746cc1f84face0f7dff80947; 78e53e1a794c2c509114f6b16491cf68d2fae238; 284636fc53503d4fb192b77e941dc1edf9359789; 6a9026f13d8188038b8acb5be8f819c288221646; f9e58478f43a856bf9dedd72235952e3df9f5b50; 1c90dfcfcaf15b5c0462e7a37a5bb5a199950263; 916bcbcfff6f52dc1f632fc8cd980e86d76ab77e; cfa3ca8c6020bc0ecd6c78d042909621bb93bce2; 69cc658ba895b5cbab9a66c298df53c7caf6574b; fb7f4b35aaee66c1bfe0bfbc1b80859f4e61c0ce; 118ce6cbf11eaeb2da9202e585a61695f72b7db7; c394f6a983d755e5a857ba3a39e85bcf5082cc55; 1385b911ac34e9917638ab38dcd4c463192e66ee; 69e0b31d504070597a165b586d5d8c1bbfce0fe3; 5436e2b37679485c8c9aeb827fcc195bfd2b6890; efabaaf6b4bba285c9eadc1c8d7b0eb5fc9fd40d; 96e4e1a7ba7f8322eda948a6a99a36210c125f0f; 5032afad266022a4a33dcbeff4ae3157463c3f2b; faade3cd27311339e38678a784dd387c5bdd4378; 2621ba0d10dc8d128d4e63de808dc07a53bec403; 5f565668349615f9a6bf93e73113ef7b71c29645; d6e1ae9f16dcf38c65255e35e8bc44fe7f0684a9; 99a8af9d1e3af8d89ada7bcc801ce8d949848e46; 7491160301cc52c46c1d8ca13eb42a0bbedd2814; 35d72e3c57a590b90a18782f2947f6ee60f37283; f3e7c7ad28771fa65b1f07737d8583e68c8868dc; b6bbf5cd6df1412218aae68eb2359822f8d5d8ae; 23dc1c18d9847924ab1f10157f0b02ffbcb6ed1f; 4ec5fd6892f60da1abd2a284209a00a823c9c5ac; 40d2e1da084f11444fdf227cdec76bf6b0f89dd8; 6b8d4cdf1385c0e436f982e4e4c45e4958ecde24; bca451df3cdfd544611cf6186e99ca991c61712b; 950715c4db3af44e274bc65f2b4ae43c1322d3c8; 58da9eac746c5d61e27b151c5f87cb75cd08c0e2; edcd1f342abed3b786499a936a959d77834fa6fb; d67f6e77ebcf0e737975ab65a8457ae21adbae18; 5973964fec6eba5d8912f64f78886e0ed0a0fb83; 71365eca0633c5c95b4b421134c9a3fc6f1e890c; d51ace83d56829cb27dc69c17fb830dd2d34c70f; 16540014fe5b7525f74f130823b1bb6d96c0b0e4; 95d3aa479ac0f5443d48985208c5ca71f443a922; 04f037fc3cf0c8f5648be275a9f1786640295301; 96980b45df029d7e282bbd0ee8ee11486a773993; 5f41fa3470de72d600e0863e0dcf664a64aae124; 2f8f9599bfb19871d192e3115fd8b18f6bd1426e,European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience,269,429-437
24629cf0c08fe928d6387c8d68e4c21e26694824,A probabilistic method for the detection and genotyping of small indels from population-scale sequence data,"MOTIVATION
High-throughput sequencing technologies have made population-scale studies of human genetic variation possible. Accurate and comprehensive detection of DNA sequence variants is crucial for the success of these studies. Small insertions and deletions represent the second most frequent class of variation in the human genome after single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Although several alignment tools for the gapped alignment of sequence reads to a reference genome are available, computational methods for discriminating indels from sequencing errors and genotyping indels directly from sequence reads are needed.


RESULTS
We describe a probabilistic method for the accurate detection and genotyping of short indels from population-scale sequence data. In this approach, aligned sequence reads from a population of individuals are used to automatically account for context-specific sequencing errors associated with indels. We applied this approach to population sequence datasets from the 1000 Genomes exon pilot project generated using the Roche 454 and Illumina sequencing platforms, and were able to detect a significantly greater number of indels than reported previously. Comparison to indels identified in the 1000 Genomes pilot project demonstrated the sensitivity of our method. The consistency in the number of indels and the fraction of indels whose length is a multiple of three across different human populations and two different sequencing platforms indicated that our method has a low false discovery rate. Finally, the method represents a general approach for the detection and genotyping of small-scale DNA sequence variants for population-scale sequencing projects.

6c05fd2901f017d693a501e49d40a65b9877d542,A genetic association study of NLRP2 and NLRP7 genes in idiopathic recurrent miscarriage.,"STUDY QUESTION
Do gene polymorphisms of two members of the human innate immune sensor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing proteins (NLRP) family, NLRP2 and NLRP7, confer susceptibility to idiopathic recurrent miscarriage (RM)?


SUMMARY ANSWER
We found a significant association of a tag single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of NLRP7 (rs26949) with idiopathic RM, while a tag SNP of NLRP2 (rs127868) showed a marginally significant association.


WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY
Human NLRP2 and NLRP7 have been suggested to be maternal effect genes, regulating early embryonic development and establishment of maternal imprints. Anecdotal evidence showed women who had experienced at least three consecutive miscarriages without hydatidiform mole carried non-synonymous NLRP7 variants. Whether these two genes are associated with idiopathic RM remains obscure.


STUDY DESIGN, SIZE AND DURATION
In this case-controlled study, 143 women who had experienced at least two consecutive spontaneous miscarriages (n = 91 women with two miscarriages, n = 52 with three or more) and 149 controls were included between 2004 and 2010.


MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS
A total of five tag SNPs of NLRP2 and eight tag SNPs of NLRP7 were genotyped using the primer extension analysis. The deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was checked using Ï‡(2) analysis. The logistic odds ratios (ORs) of RM were estimated with a 95% confidence interval (CI) in multivariate analysis after maternal age adjustment. The false discovery rate (FDR) was used to adjust for multiple testing. Tests for haplotype association with RM were performed. Gene-gene interactions among loci of the two genes were evaluated by using the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method.


MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE
One tag SNP rs269949 of NLRP7 showed significant difference between patients and controls in a recessive model (FDR P = 0.0456, age-adjusted OR (AOR) = 16.49, 95% CI = 2.00-136.11 for the GG genotype). The difference was significant in patients with two consecutive miscarriages and also in those with three or more consecutive miscarriages. Meanwhile, one tag SNP of NLRP2 (rs12768) showed marginal significance between patients and controls in a co-dominant model (FDR P = 0.0505, AOR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.29-3.58 for the AC genotype). In the haplotype analysis, NLRP2 and NLRP7 did not show any significant difference between the patients and controls. MDR test revealed that there is no significant gene-gene interaction among loci of NLRP2 and NLRP7.


LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION
The results may be biased by heterogeneous ethnicities of the Taiwanese Han and a small sample size. The genetic loci responsible for the disease as well as their functional significance also await further investigation.


WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS

f6f3f92cbfe75d4b71e5a930e44428ab0cfc4b60,Voxel-based statistical analysis of cerebral blood flow using Tc-99m ECD brain SPECT in patients with traumatic brain injury: group and individual analyses.,"PURPOSE
Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was applied to brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) to investigate regional cerebral abnormalities compared to age-matched normal controls.


METHOD
Thirteen patients with TBI underwent brain perfusion SPECT were included in this study (10 males, three females, mean age 39.8 +/- 18.2, range 21 - 74). SPM2 software implemented in MATLAB 5.3 was used for spatial pre-processing and analysis and to determine the quantitative differences between TBI patients and age-matched normal controls.


RESULTS
Three large voxel clusters of significantly decreased cerebral blood perfusion were found in patients with TBI. The largest clusters were area including medial frontal gyrus (voxel number 3642, peak Z-value = 4.31, 4.27, p = 0.000) in both hemispheres. The second largest clusters were areas including cingulated gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus of left hemisphere (voxel number 381, peak Z-value = 3.67, 3.62, p = 0.000). Other clusters were parahippocampal gyrus (voxel number 173, peak Z-value = 3.40, p = 0.000) and hippocampus (voxel number 173, peak Z-value = 3.23, p = 0.001) in the left hemisphere. The false discovery rate (FDR) was less than 0.04.


CONCLUSION
From this study, group and individual analyses of SPM2 could clearly identify the perfusion abnormalities of brain SPECT in patients with TBI. Group analysis of SPM2 showed hypoperfusion pattern in the areas including medial frontal gyrus of both hemispheres, cingulate gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus in the left hemisphere compared to age-matched normal controls. Also, left parahippocampal gyrus and left hippocampus were additional hypoperfusion areas. However, these findings deserve further investigation on a larger number of patients to be performed to allow a better validation of objective SPM analysis in patients with TBI.",2006,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yong Beom Shin"", ids = ""143649857""); list(name = ""Seong-Jang Kim"", ids = ""118964886""); list(name = ""In-Ju Kim"", ids = ""144679362""); list(name = ""Yong Ki Kim"", ids = ""98814765""); list(name = ""Dong-soo Kim"", ids = ""48693434""); list(name = ""Jae Heung Park"", ids = ""6205082""); list(name = ""Seok-Ran Yeom"", ids = ""3992513"")",5ab31b80c382adec1a4a76c8e511e99093f62193; 8a9493149be4d208bc748275c4b914494667509f; 47b2e5a153cfa80683c93f2dd0e27d23a42138ac; 8126559b4bc4da36ae3dac67b2429d047dfab17b; 743d35c88cfeb93ebbe0d3e7434c4e35b4926745; bb021dc7bc9fcee9dbbb8650e361dd999e447b6d; 125f7427ee22fd5e4dba18f45fd7cafdcb08ecdc; d2856d44d3361424d37b56b8d6d7ef47b66ab4f2; 408ce9661437814055f993e0e772a4015f02e7dd; 1db61553efaac65a648ce6a47d73111507bd1910; aa06cd2d5e68593e5351b503d58bef2015276534; bdbe1ed56fc834185103c53c36fb73f8ce141c7d,,Brain injury,20 6,"

c8863e181b1aba02e2ae7a28d92c37767a96ee1f,A Sparse Regression Method for Group-Wise Feature Selection with False Discovery Rate Control,"The method of Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation, or SLOPE, is a sparse regression method recently introduced by Bogdan et. al. [1] . It can be used to identify significant predictor variables in a linear model that may have more unknown parameters than observations. When the correlations between predictor variables are small, the SLOPE method is shown to successfully control the false discovery rate (the expected proportion of the irrelevant among all selected predictors) at a user specified level. However, the requirement for nearly uncorrelated predictors is too restrictive for genomic data, as demonstrated in our recent study [2] by an application of SLOPE to realistic simulated DNA sequence data. A possible solution is to divide the predictor variables into nearly uncorrelated groups, and to modify the procedure to select entire groups with an overall significant group effect, rather than individual predictors. Following this motivation, we extend SLOPE in the spirit of Group LASSO to Group SLOPE, a method that can handle group structures between the predictor variables, which are ubiquitous in real genomic data. Our theoretical results show that Group SLOPE controls the group-wise false discovery rate (gFDR), when groups are orthogonal to each other. For use in non-orthogonal settings, we propose two types of Monte Carlo based heuristics, which lead to gFDR control with Group SLOPE in simulations based on real SNP data. As an illustration of the merits of this method, an application of Group SLOPE to a dataset from the Framingham Heart Study results in the identification of some known DNA sequence regions associated with bone health, as well as some new candidate regions.

We hypothesized that this abrupt change circulatory flow would be associated with acute metabolic changes related to tissue oxygen delivery. Methods We enrolled 32 patients in a prospective observational cohort study undergoing elective LVAD placement at the University of Colorado from 2013 to 2017 and collected blood immediately before surgery and 24 hours post-operatively and performed clinical follow up for a minimum of 1 year. We performed UHPLC-MS based metabolomics to quantify 24 metabolites with heavy isotope labelled standards and measured an additional 91,413 features with a minimum signal to noise ratio of 3 and minimum relative ion intensity of 1000. We performed the statistical analysis with JMP v14 and for the metabolomics analysis we report false discovery rate corrected p values. Results Subsequent heart transplantation significantly increased survival in patients undergoing elective LVAD placement (Table 1). After surgery, we noted significant changes in patientsâ€™ metabolomic profile with glutamate decreasing and kynurenine and leucine/isoleucine increasing. We also identified 6941 out of 91,413 features with an FDR corrected p value less 0.05 that were significantly different between the pre-surgery and post-surgery samples (Figure 1) Conclusion LVAD placement resulted in significant metabolomic changes after 24 hours. Subsequent analyses have the potential to identify metabolomic profiles that predict clinical outcomes or guide therapies.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Nathan Clendenen"", ids = ""3853483""); list(name = ""William K.

304cc171a7773be68c409000ab350ad6345d2148,Mulcom: a multiple comparison statistical test for microarray data in Bioconductor,"BackgroundMany microarray experiments search for genes with differential expression between a common ""reference"" group and multiple ""test"" groups. In such cases currently employed statistical approaches based on t-tests or close derivatives have limited efficacy, mainly because estimation of the standard error is done on only two groups at a time. Alternative approaches based on ANOVA correctly capture within-group variance from all the groups, but then do not confront single test groups with the reference. Ideally, a t-test better suited for this type of data would compare each test group with the reference, but use within-group variance calculated from all the groups.ResultsWe implemented an R-Bioconductor package named Mulcom, with a statistical test derived from the Dunnett's t-test, designed to compare multiple test groups individually against a common reference. Interestingly, the Dunnett's test uses for the denominator of each comparison a within-group standard error aggregated from all the experimental groups. In addition to the basic Dunnett's t value, the package includes an optional minimal fold-change threshold, m. Due to the automated, permutation-based estimation of False Discovery Rate (FDR), the package also permits fast optimization of the test, to obtain the maximum number of significant genes at a given FDR value. When applied to a time-course experiment profiled in parallel on two microarray platforms, and compared with two commonly used tests, Mulcom displayed better concordance of significant genes in the two array platforms (39% vs. 26% or 15%), and higher enrichment in functional annotation to categories related to the biology of the experiment (p value < 0.001 in 4 categories vs. 3).ConclusionsThe Mulcom package provides a powerful tool for the identification of differentially expressed genes when several experimental conditions are compared against a common reference. The results of the practical example presented here show that lists of differentially expressed genes generated by Mulcom are particularly consistent across microarray platforms and enriched in genes belonging to functionally significant groups.",2011,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Claudio Isella"", ids = ""2975656""); list(name = ""Tommaso Renzulli"", ids = ""2278371""); list(name = ""Davide CorÃ "", ids = ""49307283""); list(name = ""Enzo Medico"", ids = ""2143482"")",304cc171a7773be68c409000ab350ad6345d2148; 6f95c049a8f28193ac3c359a40c5aa285e490615; 07772ed7741fc566a995973c3ca7e8bb4a12b8ab; a9fd9b1d5dafcdef6f3b1a4cff45f1531f62437f; 9e25d9f52a0d715c674346cd94498bad3c382398; 8f56b30b0104bda99414000178d89e3718ed7ca4; a64c4a02eaeda668520e897789bdf75c1376f044; df7e96e9ffa2b5233662fd6cf491a7d1ada1f48a,304cc171a7773be68c409000ab350ad6345d2148; eaea4b47e35d7816cfdd29e1a896945f5e6d6f44; d81b3fad7ee424e8ff9dfc5973129be6547affc3; 7aeace2306487c5e5f3ff6711e1a5d3fc1e4c899; 13e6d58e6006bed58b0b67263ef94b3ac4c13293; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; e3c6006b860842ba1ad2fc1eace95f2f032b1ea4; 888b68b0713879ced708ad45dc7cfdbe11108b3b; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 7a81551ec6389c5bd1c35dd5b11e0fa5d33acfbe,BMC Bioinformatics,12,382 - 382

Here, we analyzed proteomic data from a transgenic mouse model with cardiac-specific overexpression of activated calcineurin (CnA), which results in severe cardiac hypertrophy. We applied statistically filtering and false discovery rate correction methods to identify 52 proteins that were significantly different in the CnA hearts compared to controls. Subsequent informatic analysis consisted of comparison of these 52 CnA proteins to another proteomic dataset of heart failure, three available independent microarray datasets, and correlation of their expression with the human plasma and urine proteome. Following this filtering strategy, four proteins passed these selection criteria, including myosin heavy chain 7, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7, annexin A2, and desmin. We assessed expression levels of these proteins in mouse plasma by immunoblotting, and observed significantly different levels of expression between healthy and failing mice for all four proteins. We verified antibody cross-reactivity by examining human cardiac explant tissue by immunoblotting.

fed0012d17bd2c0f8e20cd3290b0181676084782,Exposure to Low Levels of Lead in Utero and Umbilical Cord Blood DNA Methylation in Project Viva: An Epigenome-Wide Association Study,"BACKGROUND
Early-life exposure to lead is associated with deficits in neurodevelopment and with hematopoietic system toxicity. DNA methylation may be one of the underlying mechanisms for the adverse effects of prenatal lead on the offspring, but epigenome-wide methylation data for low levels of prenatal lead exposure are lacking.


OBJECTIVES
We investigated the association between prenatal maternal lead exposure and epigenome-wide DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood nucleated cells in Project Viva, a prospective U.S.-based prebirth cohort with relatively low levels of lead exposure.


METHODS
Among 268 mother-infant pairs, we measured lead concentrations in red blood cells (RBC) from prenatal maternal blood samples, and using HumanMethylation450 Bead Chips, we measured genome-wide methylation levels at 482,397 CpG loci in umbilical cord blood and retained 394,460 loci after quality control. After adjustment for batch effects, cell types, and covariates, we used robust linear regression models to examine associations of prenatal lead exposure with DNA methylation in cord blood at epigenome-wide significance level [false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05].


RESULTS
The mean [standard deviation (SD)] maternal RBC lead level was 1.22 (0.63) Î¼g/dL. CpG cg10773601 showed an epigenome-wide significant negative association with prenatal lead exposure (-1.4% per doubling increase in lead exposure; p=2.3Ã—10-7) and was annotated to C-Type Lectin Domain Family 11, Member A (CLEC11A), which functions as a growth factor for primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells. In sex-specific analyses, we identified more CpGs with FDR<0.05 among female infants (n=38) than among male infants (n=2). One CpG (cg24637308), which showed a strong negative association with prenatal lead exposure among female infants (-4.3% per doubling increase in lead exposure; p=1.1Ã—10-06), was annotated to Dynein Heavy Chain Domain 1 gene (DNHD1) which is highly expressed in human brain. Interestingly, there were strong correlations between blood and brain methylation for CpG (cg24637308) based on another independent set of samples with a high proportion of female participants.


CONCLUSION
Prenatal low-level lead exposure was associated with newborn DNA methylation, particularly in female infants. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1246.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shaowei Wu"", ids = ""48915321""); list(name = ""Marie-France Hivert"", ids = ""3362138""); list(name = ""Andres Cardenas"", ids = ""143997795""); list(name = ""Jia Zhong"", ids = ""144700606""); list(name = ""Sheryl L Rifas-Shiman"", ids = ""1398121015""); list(name = ""Golareh Agha"", ids = ""34922753""); list(name = ""Elena Colicino"", ids = ""3482892""); list(name = ""Allan C.

83e9ec3a15bb2f57edf63d13461112d94d113bab,Early depression of Ankrd2 and Csrp3 mRNAs in the polyribosomal and whole tissue fractions in skeletal muscle with decreased voluntary running.,"The wheel-lock (WL) model for depressed ambulatory activity in rats has shown metabolic maladies ensuing within 53-173 h after WL begins. We sought to determine if WL beginning after 21-23 days of voluntary running in growing female Wistar rats affected the mRNA profile in the polyribosomal fraction from plantaris muscle shortly following WL. In experiment 1, WL occurred at 0200 and muscles were harvested at 0700 daily at 5 h (WL5h, n = 4), 29 h (WL29h, n = 4), or 53 h (WL53h, n = 4) after WL. Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0 ST Arrays were used to test the initial question as to whether WL affects mRNA occupancy on skeletal muscle polyribosomes. Using a false discovery rate of 15%, no changes in mRNAs in the polyribosomal fraction were observed at WL29h and eight mRNAs (of over 8,200 identified targets) were altered at WL53h compared with WL5h. Interestingly, two of the six downregulated genes included ankyrin repeat domain 2 (Ankrd2) and cysteine-rich protein 3/muscle LIM protein (Csrp3), both of which encode mechanical stretch sensors and RT-PCR verified their WL-induced decline. In experiment 2, whole muscle mRNA and protein levels were analyzed for Ankrd2 and Csrp3 from the muscles of WL5h (4 original samples + 2 new), WL29h (4 original), WL53h (4 original + 2 new), as well as WL173 h (n = 6 new) and animals that never ran (SED, 4-5 new). Relative to WL5h controls, whole tissue Ankrd2 and Csrp3 mRNAs were lower (P < 0.05) at WL53h, WL173h, and SED; Ankrd2 protein tended to decrease at WL53h (P = 0.054) and Csrp3 protein was less in WL173h and SED rats (P < 0.05). In summary, unique early declines in Ankrd2 and Csrp3 mRNAs were identified with removal of voluntary running, which was subsequently followed by declines in Csrp3 protein levels during longer periods of wheel lock.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Michael D Roberts"", ids = ""20322660""); list(name = ""Thomas Ellis Childs"", ids = ""2503590""); list(name = ""Jacob D Brown"", ids = ""20618911""); list(name = ""J.

994adb8d142846f8020b16795def8e198c861e67,An integrative systems genetics approach reveals potential causal genes and pathways related to obesity,"BackgroundObesity is a multi-factorial health problem in which genetic factors play an important role. Limited results have been obtained in single-gene studies using either genomic or transcriptomic data. RNA sequencing technology has shown its potential in gaining accurate knowledge about the transcriptome, and may reveal novel genes affecting complex diseases. Integration of genomic and transcriptomic variation (expression quantitative trait loci [eQTL] mapping) has identified causal variants that affect complex diseases. We integrated transcriptomic data from adipose tissue and genomic data from a porcine model to investigate the mechanisms involved in obesity using a systems genetics approach.MethodsUsing a selective gene expression profiling approach, we selected 36 animals based on a previously created genomic Obesity Index for RNA sequencing of subcutaneous adipose tissue. Differential expression analysis was performed using the Obesity Index as a continuous variable in a linear model. eQTL mapping was then performed to integrate 60Â K porcine SNP chip data with the RNA sequencing data. Results were restricted based on genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms, detected differentially expressed genes, and previously detected co-expressed gene modules. Further data integration was performed by detecting co-expression patterns among eQTLs and integration with protein data.ResultsDifferential expression analysis of RNA sequencing data revealed 458 differentially expressed genes. The eQTL mapping resulted in 987 cis-eQTLs and 73 trans-eQTLs (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05), of which the cis-eQTLs were associated with metabolic pathways. We reduced the eQTL search space by focusing on differentially expressed and co-expressed genes and disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms to detect obesity-related genes and pathways. Building a co-expression network using eQTLs resulted in the detection of a module strongly associated with lipid pathways. Furthermore, we detected several obesity candidate genes, for example, ENPP1, CTSL, and ABHD12B.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first study to perform an integrated genomics and transcriptomics (eQTL) study using, and modeling, genomic and subcutaneous adipose tissue RNA sequencing data on obesity in a porcine model. We detected several pathways and potential causal genes for obesity.

Despite previous work showing a link between developmental dieldrin exposure and increased neuronal susceptibility to MPTP toxicity in male C57BL/6 mice, the mechanism mediating this effect has not been identified. Here, we tested the hypothesis that developmental exposure to dieldrin increases neuronal susceptibility via genome-wide changes in DNA methylation. Starting at 8â€‰weeks of age and prior to mating, female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 0.3â€‰mg/kg dieldrin by feeding (every 3â€‰days) throughout breeding, gestation, and lactation. At 12â€‰weeks of age, pups were sacrificed and ventral mesencephalon, containing primarily substantia nigra, was microdissected. DNA was isolated and dieldrin-related changes in DNA methylation were assessed via reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. We identified significant, sex-specific differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) and regions (DMRs) by developmental dieldrin exposure (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05), including DMCs at the Nr4a2 and Lmx1b genes, which are involved in dopaminergic neuron development and maintenance. Developmental dieldrin exposure had distinct effects on the male and female epigenome. Together, our data suggest that developmental dieldrin exposure establishes sex-specific poised epigenetic states early in life. These poised epigenomes may mediate sensitivity to subsequent toxic stimuli and contribute to the development of late-life neurodegenerative disease, including PD.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Joseph Kochmanski"", ids = ""6079068""); list(name = ""Sarah E VanOeveren"", ids = ""22516982""); list(name = ""Joseph R Patterson"", ids = ""49382374""); list(name = ""Alison I Bernstein"", ids = ""4970914"")",8e2636b328640a931888ffa2e3d0b3089d05eed8; e5191357462fda13c406778b5f2ca436028ff036,,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,169 2,"

42ea0757c6d2cfece17edff0e46c692d7ff4f69d,A Mismatch EndoNuclease Array-Based Methodology (MENA) for Identifying Known SNPs or Novel Point Mutations,"Accurate and rapid identification or confirmation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), point mutations and other human genomic variation facilitates understanding the genetic basis of disease. We have developed a new methodology (called MENA (Mismatch EndoNuclease Array)) pairing DNA mismatch endonuclease enzymology with tiling microarray hybridization in order to genotype both known point mutations (such as SNPs) as well as identify previously undiscovered point mutations and small indels. We show that our assay can rapidly genotype known SNPs in a human genomic DNA sample with 99% accuracy, in addition to identifying novel point mutations and small indels with a false discovery rate as low as 10%. Our technology provides a platform for a variety of applications, including: (1) genotyping known SNPs as well as confirming newly discovered SNPs from whole genome sequencing analyses; (2) identifying novel point mutations and indels in any genomic region from any organism for which genome sequence information is available; and (3) screening panels of genes associated with particular diseases and disorders in patient samples to identify causative mutations. As a proof of principle for using MENA to discover novel mutations, we report identification of a novel allele of the beethoven (btv) gene in Drosophila, which encodes a ciliary cytoplasmic dynein motor protein important for auditory mechanosensation.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Josep M.

f8aedc00287fb8e0816cac732d61c3bae71fa988,Mapping of numerous disease-associated expression polymorphisms in primary peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocytes.,"Genome-wide association studies of human gene expression promise to identify functional regulatory genetic variation that contributes to phenotypic diversity. However, it is unclear how useful this approach will be for the identification of disease-susceptibility variants. We generated gene expression profiles for 22 184 mRNA transcripts using RNA derived from peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocytes, and genome-wide genotype data for 516 512 autosomal markers in 200 subjects. We screened for cis-acting variants by testing variants mapping within 50 kb of expressed transcripts for association with transcript abundance using generalized linear models. Significant associations were identified for 1585 genes at a false discovery rate of 0.05 (corresponding to P-values ranging from 1 Ã— 10(-91) to 7 Ã— 10(-4)). Importantly, we identified evidence of regulatory variation for 119 previously mapped disease genes, including 24 examples where the variant with the strongest evidence of disease-association demonstrates strong association with specific transcript abundance. The prevalence of cis-acting variants among disease-associated genes was 63% higher than the genome-wide rate in our data set (P = 6.41 Ã— 10(-6)), and although many of the implicated loci were associated with immune-related diseases (including asthma, connective tissue disorders and inflammatory bowel disease), associations with genes implicated in non-immune-related diseases including lipid profiles, anthropomorphic measurements, cancer and neurologic disease were also observed. Genetic variants that confer inter-individual differences in gene expression represent an important subset of variants that contribute to disease susceptibility. Population-based integrative genetic approaches can help identify such variation and enhance our understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Amy J.

b8d564e2eda67a8c01b4f9504d3b1189180fad14,First-Level fMRI Data Analysis for Activation Detection,"As many other scientific experiments, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study has multilevel hierarchical nature. For example, for a single voxel in the brain, fMRI response is from i voxel position, in j run, of k subject. Therefore, a mixed effect model should be employed for the analysis. In framework of general linear mixed model (GLMM), both first and higher levels of the model parameters can be estimated using iterative schemes for the fMRI study. However, this is not practical for fMRI data analysis because of the computational burden of fitting GLMM at every voxel that is very expensive. As a result, most methods adopt a two-stage model method, and at the first stage, variance and effect from the first-level analysis are estimated for the second-/higher-level fMRI data analysis. In this chapter, we will focus on these variance and regression parameter estimation. Firstly, we present the method for fMRI experimental design, and then we introduce statistical methods for fMRI activation detection. A general linear model (GLM) for the activation detection is introduced. Because the residual terms of the linear model is autocorrelated, an autoregression (AR) model is adopted for correcting the model estimation error. After the fMRI signal is fitted with the GLM-AR model, we detail statistical inference method for activation detection. Finally, we present false discovery rate (FDR) and family-wise error (FWE) algorithms for the threshold correction.",2014,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Xingfeng Li"", ids = ""39844886"")",,,,,39-71

We hypothesise that different lymph node T-cell subsets are involved in the regulation of immune responses during the earliest phases of RA. Materials and Methods We included 11individuals with arthralgia without any evidence of arthritis who were positive for IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA; RA risk group), 18 DMARD naive early arthritis patients (ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria: 3 undifferentiated arthritis and 15 RA; disease duration less than 1 year) and 10 seronegative healthy controls. All study subjects underwent ultrasound-guided inguinal lymph node (LN) biopsy sampling. Gene expression profiling of whole LN biopsies (10 controls and 8 ACPA positive early arthritis patients) was performed using the Illumina array platform. Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) was used to search for significant enrichment of immunological gene sets representing certain classes of cell subsets. In all other study subjects T-helper (Th)1, cytotoxic T-cell (Tc)1, Th2, Tc2, Th17, Tc17 and regulatory T-cells (Treg) were analysed by multi-colour flow cytometry. Results First we investigated whether gene expression profiles of lymph node biopsies from ACPA positive early arthritis patients (n = 8) are different from seronegative controls (n = 10).

Procedures have been developed by authors in genetics and statistics. In this chapter, we relate these proposals. We propose two new multiple testing approaches within this framework. The first combines sensitivity analysis methods with false discovery rate estimation procedures. The second involves construction of shrinkage estimators that utilize the mixture model for multiple testing.

a3177c344129298455445edb7902d40cd9dd3bc1,Challenging False Discovery Rate: A Partition Test Based on p Values in Human Case-Control Association Studies,"Background/Aims: We consider the situation that multiple genetic variants are underlying a heritable trait and assume that each contributes to the trait only to a small degree. The aim is to develop a statistical test for disease association of these multiple variants. Methods: We expect that p values resulting from a genome-wide case-control association analysis will fall into two classes: those reflecting true association and those occurring randomly in the interval from 0 to 1. We develop a partition test to find the set of smallest p values deviating most from the number of p values expected under randomness. Results: Power calculations demonstrate the superiority of our partition test over conventional SNP-by-SNP analyses. Applications of the partition test to six published datasets show that our test is particularly suitable when multiple SNPs appear to contribute to a trait, and furnished more significant results than a well-known procedure to estimate the false discovery rate. Conclusions: Our partition test also furnishes an estimate of the number of functional SNPs underlying disease and can be highly significant, while single-locus tests may be far from significant.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jurg Ott"", ids = ""67046059""); list(name = ""Zhe Liu"", ids = ""29758694""); list(name = ""Yuanyuan Shen"", ids = ""48234835"")",72102d251bdb9e714b18ac54d5bc38839981194e; 197c104afbe9bba462160ad9cc0d880484ad5809; 8c9008b525eab0840db47bb519e17f8468910fd8; 27d1b9a2c50146e7e694472850c8f1281633fc41; 02e06b0e80eeacc33d505fe0ec424c868b143968; 38f4de7f182d7664d82f9936719ce5fe9dfe2a2b,4544ec96d5ec6e71f7795fa5498f542cb9985c7a; 2fec730b71622c54bfdcbf1b80a944ab5865c7e2; 6dd2f81265f231fc21fb0ed7f8102621165f3d97; f2c6bf5fc9edea07dbf1cbbd02c75ec745de1515; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; e50486863a0e3debd34bd0fffa7335191e8c3160; 2684d286d396bda3ee5af35b1cffe9e56f45a738; 421d5450ddd044cb53171eb69b3877a9896290ee; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 12e0425f30bf808f3bdcc81ea4fe2d50bcd61e3b; 5ac7b855d01622819679560549201fb3d40efa33; fdab8a1e305c56029f370e612b25da5740e0488f; f72c3018725844a39f7124725e2c695da6b3bc79; 7c9c96531aae7afc6bdfbcb1a6e03b20d779a17d; 6756da5a0d5e037a0c143e6418b85633561c927c; e6b29350eeff82f8e5dbf698b45de8710f5efec7; d640412f3dfb4b5539d8b8aab2e0e2d225f795ff; 84af369c0e34971b3adab41e8af72dff9dedde9b; bca451df3cdfd544611cf6186e99ca991c61712b; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; 85b2c8c8a35cd90bb0c1fc550f8d8dbad180b13f; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; 4d4571ca5a061970fc6894dacb1e46db8e08dbde; a8a37082e87d780bc4d1d7a3f49f9f8b0ad921d2; 0f527dca69b041609158eb2e2dc4218dbd46ccef; 1b93cb1032fdf2032c0f2e04d028c7e73f652068; 2d8bc065924c4729e15b565eca0e7b06a8077b2c; 8327279f02a1a919b594704d5e8794734f61184e,Human Heredity,74,45 - 50
0afe75aa3322997303c8be941a00c55cfe0bc3df,Rostral medial prefrontal dysfunctions and consummatory pleasure in schizophrenia: A meta-analysis of functional imaging studies,"A large number of imaging studies have examined the neural correlates of consummatory pleasure and anticipatory pleasure in schizophrenia, but the brain regions where schizophrenia patients consistently demonstrate dysfunctions remain unclear. We performed a series of meta-analyses on imaging studies to delineate the regions associated with consummatory and anticipatory pleasure dysfunctions in schizophrenia. Nineteen functional magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography studies using whole brain analysis were identified through a literature search (PubMed and EBSCO; January 1990-February 2014). Activation likelihood estimation was performed using the GingerALE software. The clusters identified were obtained after controlling for the false discovery rate at p<0.05 and applying a minimum cluster size of 200 mm(3). It was found that schizophrenia patients exhibited decreased activation mainly in the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC), the right parahippocampus/amygala, and other limbic regions (e.g., the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, the putamen, and the medial globus pallidus) when consummating pleasure. Task instructions (feeling vs. stimuli) were differentially related to medial prefrontal dysfunction in schizophrenia. When patients anticipated pleasure, reduced activation in the left putamen was observed, despite the limited number of studies. Our findings suggest that the medial prefrontal cortex and limbic regions may play an important role in neural dysfunction underlying deficits in consummatory pleasure in schizophrenia.",2015,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chao Yan"", ids = ""145071038""); list(name = ""Tammy Tianxiao Yang"", ids = ""6857499""); list(name = ""Qi-jing Yu"", ids = ""10248036""); list(name = ""Zhen Jin"", ids = ""145752193""); list(name = ""Raymond Chan"", ids = ""145521960"")",67c7ba5069b4a5bb82583eedcd48f85d67944bea; 19c4b6a5609927d9e3e48bae0db93ca8c341a0bb; 24c60c80e99bb7c98a6542af3984a91301bfa996; eecc22fc932f242b185674be9b366bb6921720b5; eb432f0d5d403d789a28f23e58220914f43a5e28; bbcea460e143590b1aab679e400cbbbf211bd388; c20985ab73dadb0fd4bc52898fffed2a75dfa3a0; 7a6802745e78a831768004851e359c2bcabc2752; eec75cb3794cb82df73f028dcc834bc596d9a8a0; d11cd0c7484094a5c778d29ad9f73783613a2f6b; ec256d259ad2aa86917a63b5e424a4aa3d6ba074; 584a578b68437c77780110d4eed14f271e742a10; fa1b6b5298e13f6cb399066cef66a0c482c7def0,7d639cbd261def763d9a62a39c7dad8b288cf47f; 6f8dd809de7157123167e807070863f17b167a4a; cd49dd2682e0bef53c8bf2d0c537f3948ca51ff5; 81efde84f7d11e0266cc0e9b75d7861bffe76fb1; 436667d07403f9393eb4b45ddd0a7c3028a33cbe; ec79b1715541b06f02aa18121a59a723675136c5; c3d2c0119a8038ee8ad48f6880bea5d1718530c6; 61f847f1924c24c6d4f1902084d147ad37918129; b4719ae11978e60710fae76feff64abd607c89f2; 4304aaccf0d6501c38b34b918485a024720154b7; ba0fceb07d203fe16c64a5101e541c9801d20d79; cc9f5ee686281e89ed51f38d4fbd6cd6233bcb59; 9b9a6489172c1f564927c29b243276ad5ec131a8; c0545650c2bb8b189eac5f2836dbefd3c5aa1ccd; 10eea6b6882aa329c30a286fee1858f0af56a789; 110821586a2a33d7edc2b1e27d07bd092edbf228; 58253579d64c50a9a620332390b0ffb8609d448d; 7f5061b58cb59ebd1e41bc350cdd5c73d53e4b3e; 9da384d552d43c9dd7c466d207522b12738d7c84; 995b9a8eb21deb73ed12a8632c104199315907c7; 4b23e43867db7f7365d6068ea641a3cb86192450; 62da6b4e27b28137115c12ceae548860c4717a9a; ed9b67d2656a078aaa1b9e5fd89e597a20e86b27; 04410646fbd05e91900c5e65122336b14273e4ca; 842275eaad9138135e1f458d496b9cdbf3852858; 7731b19ded937a465e83f5ddb1d3fa8019427617; b0f0cf8a0c3f11f7c27ba6136ef9c9b33c76de4a; 0be63f9394d6fb5c1d024fa21b33d18f3d105958; 6b4a03cfa15d8c766407c4cfaf4afd6d50cfef31; 63be58262ecd41e2ca471ecd975af14667b125c6; f8a7bddcc781545ec7305181733085b79d0ade50; 31239a490fcbd10923e07027dd2831c3ee26969b; 49aa3fb7e274446110404deef28b1d40a0c04ece; 09cb945ad105d9eb921e6a15ff33eb76c7dd527a; 84380c91f5616c4301544bcbd797e87ef643e44b; 428a16bce17a0a8513dabbb9d36dbf8bcde9e25f; 8c63016fe564a141770f6bc03454d67f72eb52f6; 8e0e6465632f36ae63626bf5d780e18537baa72d; 9699d2e9e37b5574d288077da885747ac051e58e; fbff475bcbc76127eda4c34904a89d8fa64e1696; 879a678d38dce703cc3169c03103f206772e4477; cec09c2b82abbcca6aa679a0d142726c9ad36a5f; 429bef6ba5d4185c29f0609bf5e3402e32423473; 44b63c74c3668a4969016eda8b32b36f2bb45000; d29f18bb491d7bdd902c1a4458ed645cd170b4db; bc013db746b9df2658664d1b91b5fd9b3f041c1e; 193b4e4deb94641f7f19b2f656eeb1904831b7bb; 5038c4446502860de43637e5c8aa9e4fcd41bd41; 2b2b12966f7a61a485cd03ee3011403754cf1018; df356a36be79bd782fea7cb9df83192e874aebdc; 08b389434239bfd90d24c96e82a8d6100631324e; 968b503d37ca931eef4b5a0fa0d1f59ac7e3992d; e9ba9c8739afbdd4c19ce8d6fadba82bb741997a; 4eff58e6bed0d40bb930a5ed784146b116e68d9b; 9d03e5fa79378bc45c219de043955ab07f123c9e; 381021edc0498c0ee1800e6b724fcd27d353a05d; c909081999d19d37a01b808c4cd7eb60a98f96f0; 602aaf4e25141683ae0b74d766be75c1c09bfe62; 8a6e800494a487c39f978cfd0d795962e71b0f61; 07461d66167ee8c6c8df8aa814ae300161532cd1; 368ef572df598716bd903343444a4e735bb412c5; 46d81c5d0d3b80d36d40d7d2c84520dddcae73c1; a599600e13e8b689ed347be1c29f7e906b4f2c6b; 8562da79a83dcdf3597ed9f471b14e31d44f720e; fe4a9d6e42162228d9bee072e6ca1462c158e958; fbf53d74c7642c9eabd141f118775ee11b631eaf; 8e80c82b93c760246bdda9c0abf4a40a3516b191; 90d3c4f3d1c160aca2828dbb40c0db3dd87159bb; 825cfe877757a0e4f1c4853cf0d6ee6e14314be6; c788bdbd3bea7d3f7b33faed67eae5a4af1a69d1; 59e4c3c914e6c5b496fff0a99f9068e83f61f7e6; 256df8d419bcdc1bf87668ef6aacf89c7eb6f68f; 3d8e45c5981055fbc2f10774d625095d8d911dad; 8ac5ab8a156b4d408723c5dbdb33b47a9dfaaa09; ce1ad6e28a3c4717cbddce38fe5fc5ce6e67abee; e88698a6f7889d53486f98c18ac4051b9cf97079; 34886a69edb7ef14d5a55a48097c5bc47c9b52e7; a8226a308356b279d22882eb4b0a061e1432a7ca; 13804710929c50b89e008c11695af75b3998dd58; 477a1a0563d9082e84846e464869bb3c55b1bdbd,Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging,231,187-196
6eab49ee257e9eb45b5c2c1f94a2717951d6a248,Demonstration of decreased gray matter concentration in the midbrain encompassing the dorsal raphe nucleus and the limbic subcortical regions in major depressive disorder: an optimized voxel-based morphometry study.,"BACKGROUND
Previous neuroimaging studies in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have reported changes in several brain areas, such as the medial and dorsolateral orbital cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and basal ganglia. However, the results of these studies are inconsistent, and relatively few studies have been conducted using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to detect gray matter concentration (GMC) abnormalities in patients with MDD.


METHODS
We examined 47 MDD patients and 51 healthy controls to investigate structural abnormalities using a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging system, which was normalized to a customized T1 template and segmented with optimized VBM. Analysis of covariance with age and gender as covariates was adopted for the VBM statistics; the level of statistical significance was set at P<0.05 for the corrected false discovery rate.


RESULTS
Decreased GMC was found in MDD patients in the bilateral amygdalae, hippocampi, fusiform gyri, lingual gyri, insular gyri, middle-superior temporal gyri, thalami, cingulate gyri, the central lobule of the cerebellum, and the midbrain encompassing the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN).


LIMITATIONS
Half of our study subjects were taking antidepressants. This may have been a potential confounding factor if any of the medications affected cortical volume.


CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that the GMC of several regions associated with emotion regulation was lower in MDD patients. In particular, we found decreased GMC in the DRN. These findings may provide a better understanding of the anatomical properties of the neural mechanisms underlying the etiology of MDD.",2011,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hwa-Young Lee"", ids = ""3208646""); list(name = ""Woo Suk Tae"", ids = ""5316406""); list(name = ""Ho-kyoung Yoon"", ids = ""5276812""); list(name = ""Byeong-Taek Lee"", ids = ""123518083""); list(name = ""Jong-Woo Paik"", ids = ""52163737""); list(name = ""Kyu-Ri Son"", ids = ""114867909""); list(name = ""Yu-whan Oh"", ids = ""3834355""); list(name = ""Min-Soo Lee"", ids = ""33111554""); list(name = ""Byung-Joo Ham"", ids = ""2668127"")",39634f25438a4e45518b648b8ecc66c1b36f9c09; eeb99180841734ea04c4f3638f4796f27484caab; ba10fa04598dd32c60e6533cd4b15c60e4001cdc; b65eb1257128ef961914c649759e0800c5154942; f22e5a34a5ad47edf2898adb627139c0b45965f8; b1b679eb2fc3a351f07efdb2445d5eaff8563491; 9c2d2fc3e41b97e3b7154239bdf8b96d20682dd7; 13ba68c527b3c3089e9f3950ae51a9d322a0ca8d; 1d1d5cce210748fbc6f4e2a8511c2f3c65581752; 30c302c5fb5a6558da8abfc082535145f130bd4e; c2015a013df4489cc457011bdc5e9506b3b2aabf; 1f8ac0157a83e46946d98928ca3537a92cb58766; 24beae76c39590a10f1e3560a7fc5aecdbf8f2ea; 1a0f54550df5f671bb2f0e63695b53a95bb7ee63; dbc4add2bd8fcc814b036f02bbee99df78155a41; fe2815e4e39777ce5d77461800fb87c4770fd17a; f9b78a5ac5d805906d0571e4acfb8332564c1c97; 994174862d73de64bb26abeb410813cd3a81d68f; 9f3169a7e48b7eaa6cdd89b994af7cd4eaf2ee42; b914c3b2d6cfbdbb4d4581f57b4cf60d3b51eaf3; 0a2fdd06da3fd1b42daa416dc96c720fb91fca39; 43cead2c31b95144a463f1c31ae7869eeaee7ccb; 6b6cc0599b89588abcd7c9bfc00e5e0e412928f4; 11bd41956b7cf9af542ce1e637d79d664e2936f4; 37179b45be2e81b4edfca08042b37da365deab19; 2c47f47caa6df4145e052a8b69cfd09932cbc51e; b839e89743b06409fb323f42ad7923401515d63e; af3fbe61cecfee967ca1310369cd469dc2811198; 705642c448b960db1363c2df19fd075d21f34d2c; 42770a88aeb0a4f8c5d08a960f0872a754ac18af; 3e0521b96d4fa7e30b80d69e47123cf4e7e1fd41; 6a289b2412223da75de617864ecd540d72e0f5ab; 5f188a708bdfdfe38a8a163ebc84741d5c33fd56; 2ac17fff2c98f3915e349ed4ffbf02aca573992b; 2980e726a2f504973af91f10ff15a8b25da2db3c; 9bb61f0cc0d60ba34b545175fed1c16f0fbd5d37; 194f0fa5ab734ab82ed2cfe90989c88a0d9ed7d4; 4136fc8bdfecdd6fa7c9636df1e58689c1842706; 73daecdb4af8758c3486d4c9ce42ff1cc3b8d517; efed519e28da71dbc5a94f0a8586981c0707fd8a; 4ec440794111e470b4a7ebea96404ef69f57c4c2; 58d798a4841b8feb862085ff45663eca41111653; 1588a6b8d054f39e35b40b3f42c6e94db80a39ca; 0af9622d0173dac2618d46bde247408ffcd223cd; bcc1b5f6f5bd16c9293cd42c93071c1b73cf4b98; 7cd3abfcc4ece79206bf23f023d30d7c66851a1e; aaddc081c740450f4bcb3a9d338dc9b95ae9aad4; e6a6fca819d53bfb98a04cc7a69254162382e433; cf7e332ad43106d67d2a8e71c1fff3414c6865a3; 43541a77d6586e44c54844fd7903ada83cc122dd; 51507f10f61e32d36156a8e911ce002a47bd9f11; b84cf6368a37b64659709e8e2bcbd695b8aa5853; c9885883b4d5f21e73bcd8854f915e778f3b42bb,,Journal of affective disorders,133 1-2,"

The main focus of these methods is to prevent an inflation of false positives. However, this comes with a serious decrease in power and therefore leads to a problematic imbalance between type I and type II errors (Lieberman & Cunningham, 2009). In this research, we present a method to estimate the number of activated features. The goal is twofold: â€¢ Given the expected number of active units, widely used methods to control the false discovery rate (FDR) can be made adaptive and more powerful. â€¢ The type I and type II error rate following such a thresholding technique can be estimated enabling a direct trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Chen, Wang, Eberly, Caffo, & Schwartz (2009) argue that activation foci in fMRI data are often small and local leading to a large proportion of null voxels. However, task-related activation is expected to occur in clusters of voxels rather than in isolated single voxels. We consider peaks of activation instead of voxels and provide a procedure to estimate the number of active peaks. Concentrating on peaks leads to an enormous data reduction, and the proportion of non-null hypotheses can be expected to be much larger among peaks than among voxels. Given an estimate of the number of active and non-active peaks, we demonstrate how an adaptive FDR controlling procedure on peaks can be obtained and how false positive and negative rates associated with this procedure can be estimated. This allows researchers to reconsider the balance between sensitivity and specificity in function of study goals. The method is evaluated and illustrated using simulation studies and a real data example. References Chen, S., Wang, C., Eberly, L., Caffo, B., & Schwartz, B. (2009).

3863f23287b092c06e0406d16c10fd2e4a9f60d3,Parity Conditions the Risk for Low Birth Weight after Maternal Exposure to Air Pollution.,"Multiparous mothers have greater umbilical blood flow and thus more efficient transport of pollutants than primiparous mothers. We tested a hypothesis that multiparous mothers are more prone to have an infant with low birth weight (LBW) after prenatal exposure to air pollution. A study was conducted on a representative group of more than 74,000 singleton, live, full-term infants. Birth data were obtained from the birth registry, while pollution data were from an environmental monitoring system (Poland). Multiple comparisons were controlled by the false discovery rate procedure (FDR). After standardization, the harmful effect of carbon monoxide (CO) on the odds ratio (OR) for LBW was seen among the multiparous mothers (ORÂ =Â 1.28; 95% CI 1.06-1.54), while in primiparous mothers it was nonsignificant. The effect of CO on the OR for LBW differed according to parity, which was confirmed by the test for interaction (FDR-adjusted pÂ =Â 0.03). The interaction between parity and sulfur dioxide (SO2) was statistically nonsignificant (FDR-adjusted pÂ =Â 0.08). Multiparous mothers may be more vulnerable to CO than primiparous mothers. Parity may be the modifier of the association between pollutants and the risk of LBW.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Anna Merklinger-Gruchala"", ids = ""1402525819""); list(name = ""Grazyna JasieÅ„ska"", ids = ""5268989""); list(name = ""Maria Kapiszewska"", ids = ""6933228"")",777888b85e2986f3b6b1935667a344781fbd9b97; 53ac0f0b81d8bb9be7fb74c4ff4ebba3283adeeb; 303330b4ea0b626f2d2e1a4c0433a492333bc82a,498fd6558d0e9e90dd12698b0b811867451b108a; c1f673cb5e8293f9fc2acece0195afe41076045f; d2ba99967e5644c89e6c66a87629610fe44f857d; 89f59ef699f9d66e335b094fe22e7ee50dec2000; b6bad5a7ae1ede260113b53655d1b7a259b02045; e65af714ba7d5f493cb1e762317c126d3d988b72; ce242a6f7b8f4063d69e8ed5602d51289bda02ab; b6fb952a6db8912ada724b40afbf23eccee7d9ec; 02d90516986bc804cabcb64c454ba4d2b27a9464; 8ecd26a5460b1729e957389d99085ded9764d872; 48e57a1e68070ce753a139532d226d923f567fe2; e352969c6a79d6d4ff1a0ce2498d04f6427efd95; e750b79b6da2ba6afa30b8727bd7538aebaa8821; 2ddbe32cf7187f4d06eec19cd5bbaf6ee2416612; 28490281afada2ee5d89d3f95576c4e9652c4002; d4233857d501c93372797dc0fc3c039afd220202; d0afd4e9adf7a7254b366063dd419fee17ba9893; aeac313f70fcd0745e3cbb4b1ed00103c5369321; 14a9087dd760b8959720c4c71ff1d4fe5c6fb1fc; 2deec9341b78601f2f3c1493c9163f9af7e336bd; f14f147a007a0bb739f70818fff433763494ed3f; eb424d268687210a927f7f30904f5c522dfd2697; 9cd5bc1795ec13faa96b6383710edd453ac72792; 9bc7f7fa047a27b88cf442bd7a864dadaa2cd1c7; cdf6a33e2cbc0a94916ef0f68b9a2b41efae5aa5; 52745c8ab796cf5ae6837bd46f6a7a32f36d58b5; 029d3019c7e58fd8499a5af53c5250e4fc55b6bc; 7281d21495d3d46271d5b87a60b11f19bee7de89; b891dbdcfcfec6c16de06c027ec1a7853b485d82; b4071ce30159b5ffafdfe144766300a28109b974; 5b33d4c30fb6d7fe7fe4cffcd8e44cb7b5ef6783; d3337054d5a896c53e4054debcfc5ca99c5433c5; b0e4c95a94190fab773caee6eff0f65234975b7c; 78fc6f698a0cbb477f5d1228a784abac8150bca3; 781829de25bcd5621b3e77b8aa7a9160d76fa18a; 06486522020637ad60863572e6a3e7b650f22a5a; 96938a0b79d60a7f901eec999e62cfbb4aa78db3; cd2d41ad5bcf5fb0ed537fff459e00b30e4dde65; c0f1485c630c9177b2f37f567689feb7713a113f; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 75457a8c309ba62e0436bdb00983182b1bc228c5; cd8b60444d8c5a61bc6201f27067f625f57f4ccf; 65f890d707666543491abf7c423c1c4063421ee1; 5efe61b2b76c8af17a03fc7c1ce09928777d4975; b47d82086a44832396e756f19b29db93ee5408d2; 2ac35a669ab65ac13db2add630459115e3e47161,Biodemography and social biology,63 1,"

a9d2913bd92f8a039b69e2555777b3b5a703b7b5,Mapping quantitative trait loci for T lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood in swine,"BackgroundIncreased disease resistance through improved general immune capacity would be beneficial for the welfare and productivity of farm animals. T lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood play an important role in immune capacity and disease resistance in animals. However, very little research to date has focused on quantitative trait loci (QTL) for T lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood in swine.ResultsIn the study, experimental animals consist of 446 piglets from three different breed populations. To identify QTL for T lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood in swine, the proportions of CD4+, CD8+, CD4+CD8+, CD4+CD8-, CD4-CD8+, and CD4-CD8- T cells and the ratio of CD4+:CD8+ T cells were measured for all individuals before and after challenge with modified live CSF (classical swine fever) vaccine. Based on the combined data of individuals from three breed populations, genome-wide scanning of QTL for these traits was performed based on a variance component model, and the genome wide significance level for declaring QTL was determined via permutation tests as well as FDR (false discovery rate) correction. A total of 27 QTL (two for CD4+CD8+, one for CD4+CD8-, three for CD4-CD8+, two for CD4-CD8-, nine for CD4+, two for CD8+, and eight for CD4+:CD8+ ratio) were identified with significance level of FDR < 0.10, of which 11 were significant at the level of FDR < 0.05, including the five significant at FDR < 0.01.ConclusionsWithin these QTL regions, a number of known genes having potential relationships with the studied traits may serve as candidate genes for these traits. Our findings herein are helpful for identification of the causal genes underlying these immune-related trait and selection for immune capacity of individuals in swine breeding in the future.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xin Lu"", ids = ""145574671""); list(name = ""Jian-feng Liu"", ids = ""39605474""); list(name = ""Yuan-fang Gong"", ids = ""5663799""); list(name = ""Zhi-Peng Wang"", ids = ""40072271""); list(name = ""Yang Liu"", ids = ""144440741""); list(name = ""Qin Zhang"", ids = ""49347231"")",a9439ad80d1e846a8e5fa9117d2154cbff4f8aba; 443cfd44cddb1cd79363defc1be32068c40790b9; 0855c356c547034c2f38b37343eddd3df00359ef; 634a9d4bc5c505675587400be133a42d853e68b5; 8da9690991300abb5faa908d48fa6d5ade808890; 1d19801abfd17f65dc46274e6d44f10656aa02b6; edab937b11dc79af08d616f9361c35cbfaf4be56; 67e9002eae7a19c4817460c0ea23ffc388da381c; def37316b1a13f5e5ca8264d3b94939458df6f08; f2c022599859fb0e490d709582496a98e9588007,5da37dae9bd66acbd416dcfe793f2d48ed90e921; aad0b8fb8012ae95460188e7214f1f0d729948b1; 9eb38b8e6df2a2cddcf1c432c8e659a1a4055d5d; 43fbe2608853b437931c3ba81bc3c11df3a2d2c2; 54a8ec0287f9fd17846ffa52d9831aca9731ad04; 5f41e3b3c8abaa20f9f71970261a5f0b6727f5a9; 1399e986df13aafe8b2a74ac78b85093edb6cc07; 007f6f88886383e9e8d5810335ab43d4c851803a; d53e25056c9f08f08b9deab166c8c2734545de2e; 1a023fed6adb58b42dc755c0bec1229c5b955c2f; 1496aa3d5ad7edfe0504bce0c642cea1c3f7c737; e2c84969dadaafd45f60844197e4a9fb7481f4d8; 9cb9761818d777472c8fd3e979186936c731752b; 5ce94f3f60e08c6be1cee226cf2273cba1332c49; 17fac24f21b82d9bca88cb7dea0b414b826a3599; afe8451fb70b46e39043d592d1610e2d9f6bec57; e3d531fcf4ef7815e41958293ee7734428610a0a; d70d347324e6ebc2ef04b85691f0b020e5dfea71; 12ccba3e0ed72986bfd774536c03fd8f79345025; dd3e23242d872eb7e8e31f91fe6a68ee4af3ea20; 3825ee255b21586554c55ed1c6c53619a380d785; 6bb5e80d5a6e26e8f72f4168d7b6bd82992d1679; 3e7856e631a849861a997d0e011dde348ebd1b90; b628fd1068bcb424e5a1e2ecef67bb7ab05ce517; a873c6570343f9b3e28ff00e5fb1be51cb45e5ee; f2294c2806b80e3e08e44ef011513d6d4b79ff5c; 331d580cd4e1e6676d8b19c594d42a822f7ef2f1; ca3d32c26c5de9fffb8dfbe1999a8de04a3ddc99; 923c91cb8dccbcf9d6c938a716cf7728e5fe7d11; 30793b07190f9fdbab1b930d0bd80389e6d446fd; 895d104386f4acbb195dcca5fcd4284f5828d7af; dfb2430855faed466884a786aeb14f8a38571c3c; c29d823dd46d02886baac25a59691c16fd17a00a; c4643792ebda23c1cac65b2b29d712c38e0c3398; 110ef71d8ec6811a5672a4c10257ce2ee7a64f24; e6e5ec83cc102b5b053cd98bbc1acf96d70ed5c2; 0b21bf1236982e844ab416fe1795fdce21b95ee6; a8c0176bf4eb719de1ff619397311d5a82ba9744; dcbf970c35b650f08bf14b23d71cb3e268541295; a4e84106894d80bab3636490c42d64420cbfc451; 6b994ff182cf7231f5414d6692a7a4e2faf882e8; fe75e4f295e927d7102913b1dd78d00e43d4d7a8; 11d708c0f8d53efdffd6428e3c2358ae574a951a; 3239df0d500efe134068dc091464a04956f40b02; 48360aa122b5e0366b8620f68d016ec30deba396; c5fe0e2828e274d7464e184fa02aa84925c759b4; 57bce5f44081c5785ebd4f2aef41ac6e22dc12a8; d6935ae919acdb0dca1d136f54e7d9dee8735361; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; d5d110d25c80a8362106dc0ea4613ede24381c8b,BMC Genetics,12,79 - 79

To address this gap in knowledge, we performed an unbiased genome-wide expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping study to identify common regulatory (expression) single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs) in mid-secretory endometrium. We identified 423 cis-eQTLs for 132 genes that were significant at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. After pruning for strong LD (r2 >0.95), we tested for associations between eSNPs and fecundability (the ability to get pregnant), measured as the length of the interval to pregnancy, in 117 women. Two eSNPs were associated with fecundability at a FDR of 5%; both were in the HLA region and were eQTLs for the TAP2 gene (P = 1.3x10-4) and the HLA-F gene (P = 4.0x10-4), respectively. The effects of these SNPs on fecundability were replicated in an independent sample. The two eSNPs reside within or near regulatory elements in decidualized human endometrial stromal cells. Our study integrating eQTL mapping in a primary tissue with association studies of a related phenotype revealed novel genes and associated alleles with independent effects on fecundability, and identified a central role for two HLA region genes in human implantation success.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Courtney K Burrows"", ids = ""5492569""); list(name = ""GÃ¼lÃ¼m Kosova"", ids = ""6641780""); list(name = ""Catherine Herman"", ids = ""40631714""); list(name = ""Kristen M.

76aec2bafcade50e4b8b168b3f9deae12b6eb1e3,A Polymorphism Affecting MYB Binding within the Promoter of the PDCD4 Gene is Associated with Severe Asthma in Children,"A previous genome-wide association study in asthma revealed putative associations that merit further investigation. In this study, the genome-wide significant associations of SNPs at the 5% false discovery rate were examined in independent groups of severe asthmatics. The panel consisted of 397 severe asthmatic adults, 116 severe asthmatic children, and a collection of 207 family-trios with an asthmatic proband. Three SNPs in the PDCD4 gene (rs6585018:G>A, rs1322997:C>A, and rs34104444:G>A) were significantly associated with severe childhood asthma (P values: 0.003, 0.002, 0.004) and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels (P values: 0.034, 0.041, 0.052). In an independent group of 234 asthmatic children and 652 controls, PDCD4 SNPs rs1407696:T>G and rs11195360:T>C were associated with total IgE levels (P values: 0.006, 0.014). In silico analysis of PDCD4 locus showed that rs6585018:G>A had the potential to affect MYB transcription factor binding, shown to act as a PDCD4-transcription inducer. Electromobility shift assays and reporter assays revealed that rs6585018:G>A alters MYB binding thereby influencing the expression of PDCD4. SNPs within MYB itself confer susceptibility to eosinophilia and asthma. Our association between a variant MYB binding site in PDCD4 and the severest form of childhood asthma therefore suggests that PDCD4 is a novel molecule of importance to asthmatic inflammatory responses.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Aristea Binia"", ids = ""47810265""); list(name = ""Nicole van Stiphout"", ids = ""6416019""); list(name = ""Liming Liang"", ids = ""3039333""); list(name = ""Sven Michel"", ids = ""48786950""); list(name = ""Pankaj K Bhavsar"", ids = ""4783411""); list(name = ""Kian Fan Chung"", ids = ""1694211""); list(name = ""Christopher E Brightling"", ids = ""4431650""); list(name = ""Peter J.

Results based on uncorrected p-values yielded numerous significant differences in spot intensity which could not be replicated in two additional runs. The best strategy for avoiding these ""false-positive"" results was strongly dependent on the type of result. In experiments yielding very marked group differences in spot intensity, calculation of the ""False Discovery Rate"" (FDR) by the Benjamini and Hochberg method corrected the results with sufficient reliability. In experiments yielding relatively small (p-values>0.001) group differences, up to 100% of all results which were significant in two repeated runs were excluded (""false-negative"") by calculation of the FDR. In such experiments, significant differences need confirmation by repeated runs.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Murat Eravci"", ids = ""4257748""); list(name = ""U.

Identifying these genetic factors should significantly improve our ability to predict of osteoporosis and its associated risks. Genetic mapping using collaborative cross mice (CC), a genetically diverse recombinant inbred mouse reference panel, offers a powerful tool to identify causal loci at a resolution under one mega base-pairs, with a relatively small cohort size.Here, we utilized 31 CC lines (160 mice of both sexes in total) to perform genome-wide haplotype mapping across 77,808 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Haplotype scans were refined by imputation with the catalogue of sequence variation segregating in the CC to suggest potential candidate genes. Trabecular traits were obtained following microtomographic analysis, performed on 10-Î¼m resolution scans of the femoral distal metaphysis. We measured the trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV), number (Tb.N), thickness (Tb.Th), and connectivity density (Conn.D).ResultsHeritability of these traits ranged from 0.6 to 0.7. In addition there was a significant (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) sex effect in all traits except Tb.Th. Our haplotype scans yielded six quantitative trait loci (QTL) at 1Â % false discovery rate; BV/TV and Tb.Th produced two proximal loci each, on chromosome 2 and 7, respectively, and Tb.N and Conn.D yielded one locus on chromosomes 8 and 14, respectively. We identified candidate genes with previously-reported functions in bone biology, and implicated unexpected genes whose function in bone biology has yet to be assigned. Based on the literature, among the genes that ranked particularly high in our analyses (Pâ€‰<â€‰10-6) and which have a validated causal role in skeletal biology, are Avp, Oxt, B2m (associated with BV/TV), Cnot7 (with Tb.N), Pcsk6, Rgma (with Tb.Th), Rb1, and Cpb2 (with Conn.D). Other candidate genes strongly suggested by our analyses are Sgcz, Fgf20 (associated with Tb.N), and Chd2 (with Tb.Th).ConclusionWe have demonstrated for the first time genome-wide significant association between several genetic loci and trabecular microstructural parameters for genes with previously reported experimental observations, as well as proposing a role for new candidate genes with no previously characterized skeletal function.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Roei Levy"", ids = ""40897376""); list(name = ""Richard F Mott"", ids = ""39899497""); list(name = ""Fuad A.

3d307161fa1bcdd7a6522344438083a0167cba44,Potential association of vacuum cleaning frequency with an altered gut microbiota in pregnant women and their 2-year-old children,"BackgroundWesternized lifestyle and hygienic behavior have contributed to dramatic changes in the human-associated microbiota. This particularly relates to indoor activities such as house cleaning. We therefore investigated the associations between washing and vacuum cleaning frequency and the gut microbiota composition in a large longitudinal cohort of mothers and their children. The gut microbiota composition was determined using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene Illumina deep sequencing.ResultsWe found that high vacuum cleaning frequency about twice or more a week was associated with an altered gut microbiota composition both during pregnancy and for 2-year-old children, while there were no associations with house washing frequency. In total, six Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) showed significant False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrected associations with vacuum cleaning frequency for mothers (two positive and four negative) and five for 2-year-old children (four positive and one negative). For mothers and the 2-year-old children, OTUs among the dominant microbiota (average >5Â %) showed correlation to vacuum cleaning frequency, with an increase in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii for mothers (pâ€‰=â€‰0.013, FDR corrected), and Blautia sp. for 2-year children (pâ€‰=â€‰0.012, FDR corrected).ConclusionsBacteria showing significant associations are among the dominant gut microbiota, which may indicate indirect immunomodulation of the gut microbiota possibly through increased allergen (dust mites) exposure as a potential mechanism.

289355a54eee1fad98471f32105823cb059a5b76,Improving statistical inference for gene expression profiling data by borrowing information,"Gene expression profiling experiments, in particular, microarray experiments, are popular in genomics research. However, in addition to the great opportunities provided by such experiments, statistical challenges also arise in the analysis of expression profiling data. The current thesis discusses statistical issues associated with gene expression profiling experiments and develops new statistical methods to tackle some of these problems. In Chapter 2, we consider the insufficient sample size problem in detecting differential gene expression. We address the problem by developing and evaluating methods for variance model selection. The idea is that information about error variances might be learned from related datasets to improve the estimation of error variances. We develop a modified multiresponse permutation procedure (MRPP), modified cross-validation procedures, and the right AICc (corrected Akaikeâ€™s information criterion) for choosing a variance model. Through realistic simulations based on three real microarray studies, we evaluate the proposed methods and suggest practical recommendations for data analysis. In Chapter 3, we address the multiple testing problem by improving the estimation of the distribution of noncentrality parameters given a large number of two-sample t-tests. We provide parametric, nonparametric and semiparametric estimators for the distribution of noncentrality parameters, as well as false discovery rates (FDR) and local FDR. Simulations show that our density estimates are closer to the underlying truth and that our estimates of FDR are also improved relative to competing methods under a variety of situations. In Chapter 4, we develop a novel combination of two statistical techniques with the aim to by-pass the curse of dimensionality problem in detecting differential expression of genes. We accept the fact that, in â€œsmall N , large pâ€ situations, the data are not sufficient to provide",2010,Computer Science,"list(name = ""L.

e6033d062b51b5574feedc2bdcafa091c2aa7a68,A reliable approach to distinguish between transient with and without HFOs using TQWT and MCA,"Recent studies have reported that discrete high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the range of 80-500Hz may serve as promising biomarkers of the seizure focus in humans. Visual scoring of HFOs is tiring, time consuming, highly subjective and requires a great deal of mental concentration. Due to the recent explosion of HFOs research, development of a robust automated detector is expected to play a vital role in studying HFOs and their relationship to epileptogenesis. Therefore, a handful of automated detectors have been introduced in the literature over the past few years. In fact, all the proposed methods have been associated with high false-positive rates, which essentially arising from filtered sharp transients like spikes, sharp waves and artifacts. In order to specifically minimize false positive rates and improve the specificity of HFOs detection, we proposed a new approach, which is a combination of tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT), morphological component analysis (MCA) and complex Morlet wavelet (CMW). The main findings of this study can be summarized as follows: The proposed method results in a sensitivity of 96.77%, a specificity of 85.00% and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 07.41%. Compared to this, the classical CMW method applied directly on the signals without pre-processing by TQWT-MCA achieves a sensitivity of 98.71%, a specificity of 18.75%, and an FDR of 29.95%. The proposed method may be considered highly accurate to distinguish between transients with and without HFOs. Consequently, it is remarkably reliable and robust for the detection of HFOs.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sahbi Chaibi"", ids = ""2716472""); list(name = ""Tarek Lajnef"", ids = ""2274531""); list(name = ""Zied Sakka"", ids = ""3300498""); list(name = ""Mounir Samet"", ids = ""3146042""); list(name = ""Abdennaceur Kachouri"", ids = ""2480885"")",cdae6e31f436ab10d82cac06cf475f17ee55cc62; 98d502d76c4de4794e02eb198b6950bf851496ae; 3ceb8f9df4d06ffa4f193040cc73f58c6937d2b6; 0c1c14a2c9fd98bcfb5434f2f68732a109feef3a; 2f5d7ebcfe93f26cf0ef4ecfce8593be18804e1e; eb6cd1871e2c9a516d73a19e9c20262074874332; 3b93e270c826d56dac92a440ed73a8a03314c685; 918b526ced7023a373503c757ba74298665acdce; d307f0791dde098fc9572ce73d06e48f38482f6b,,Journal of Neuroscience Methods,232,36-46
bc7a85db397394ef6899ddeaa0eaa7a4eb0e6ebb,False discovery rate control under Archimedean copula,"We are considered with the false discovery rate (FDR) of the linear step-up test ' LSU considered by Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). It is well known that ' LSU controls the FDR at level m0q=m if the joint distribution of p-values is multivariate totally positive of order 2. In this, m denotes the total number of hypotheses, m0 the number of true null hypotheses, and q the nominal FDR level. Under the assumption of an Ar- chimedean p-value copula with completely monotone generator, we derive a sharper upper bound for the FDR of ' LSU as well as a non-trivial lower bound. Application of the sharper upper bound to parametric subclasses of Archimedean p-value copulae allows us to increase the power of ' LSU by pre-estimating the copula parameter and adjusting q. Based on the lower bound, a sucient condition is obtained under which the FDR of ' LSU is exactly equal to m0q=m, as in the case of stochastically independent p- values. Finally, we deal with high-dimensional multiple test problems with exchangeable test statistics by drawing a connection between innite se- quences of exchangeablep-values and Archimedean copulae with completely monotone generators. Our theoretical results are applied to important cop- ula families, including Clayton copulae and Gumbel copulae.

f89761309fd5e8638f473e3143ea1b11dd7436d3,"MS-PyCloud: An open-source, cloud computing-based pipeline for LC-MS/MS data analysis","Rapid development and wide adoption of mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies have empowered scientists to study proteins and their modifications in complex samples on a large scale. This progress has also created unprecedented challenges for individual labs to store, manage and analyze proteomics data, both in the cost for proprietary software and high-performance computing, and the long processing time that discourages on-the-fly changes of data processing settings required in explorative and discovery analysis. We developed an open-source, cloud computing-based pipeline, MS-PyCloud, with graphical user interface (GUI) support, for LC-MS/MS data analysis. The major components of this pipeline include data file integrity validation, MS/MS database search for spectral assignment, false discovery rate estimation, protein inference, determination of protein post-translation modifications, and quantitation of specific (modified) peptides and proteins. To ensure the transparency and reproducibility of data analysis, MS-PyCloud includes open source software tools with comprehensive testing and versioning for spectrum assignments. Leveraging public cloud computing infrastructure via Amazon Web Services (AWS), MS-PyCloud scales seamlessly based on analysis demand to achieve fast and efficient performance.

201475d5aae5f0f96943a8d36934258843484c8e,Double impact of cigarette smoke and mechanical ventilation on the alveolar epithelial type II cell,"IntroductionVentilator-induced lung injury (VILI) impacts clinical outcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by neutrophil-mediated inflammation and loss of alveolar barrier function. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that smoking may be a risk factor for the development of ARDS. Because alveolar type II cells are central to maintaining the alveolar epithelial barrier during oxidative stress, mediated in part by neutrophilic inflammation and mechanical ventilation, we hypothesized that exposure to cigarette smoke and mechanical strain have interactive effects leading to the activation of and damage to alveolar type II cells.MethodsTo determine if cigarette smoke increases susceptibility to VILI in vivo, a clinically relevant rat model was established. Rats were exposed to three research cigarettes per day for two weeks. After this period, some rats were mechanically ventilated for 4 hours. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and differential cell count was done and alveolar type II cells were isolated. Proteomic analysis was performed on the isolated alveolar type II cells to discover alterations in cellular pathways at the protein level that might contribute to injury. Effects on levels of proteins in pathways associated with innate immunity, oxidative stress and apoptosis were evaluated in alveolar type II cell lysates by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical comparisons were performed by t-tests, and the results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate.ResultsTobacco smoke exposure increased airspace neutrophil influx in response to mechanical ventilation. The combined exposure to cigarette smoke and mechanical ventilation significantly increased BAL neutrophil count and protein content. Neutrophils were significantly higher after smoke exposure and ventilation than after ventilation alone. DNA fragments were significantly elevated in alveolar type II cells. Smoke exposure did not significantly alter other protein-level markers of cell activation, including Toll-like receptor 4; caspases 3, 8 and 9; and heat shock protein 70.ConclusionsCigarette smoke exposure may impact ventilator-associated alveolar epithelial injury by augmenting neutrophil influx. We found that cigarette smoke had less effect on other pathways previously associated with VILI, including innate immunity, oxidative stress and apoptosis.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jan Hirsch"", ids = ""48229365""); list(name = ""Robert J.

d30a488970665b5620f848fe7aff96b64d02e31f,Very Small Spiking Neural Networks Evolved for Temporal Pattern Recognition and Robust to Perturbed Neuronal Parameters,"We evolve both topology and synaptic weights of recurrent very small spiking neural networks in the presence of noise on the membrane potential. The noise is at a level similar to the level observed in biological neurons. The task of the networks is to recognise three signals in a particular order (a pattern ABC) in a continuous input stream in which each signal occurs with the same probability. The networks consist of adaptive exponential integrate and fire neurons and are limited to either three or four interneurons and one output neuron, with recurrent and self-connections allowed only for interneurons. Our results show that spiking neural networks evolved in the presence of noise are robust to the change of neuronal parameters. We propose a procedure to approximate the range, specific for every neuronal parameter, from which the parameters can be sampled to preserve, at least for some networks, high true positive rate and low false discovery rate. After assigning the state of neurons to states of the network corresponding to states in a finite state transducer, we show that this simple but not trivial computational task of temporal pattern recognition can be accomplished in a variety of ways.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Muhammad Yaqoob"", ids = ""38559207""); list(name = ""Borys WrÃ³bel"", ids = ""1713717"")",,,,,322-331
360fd82b7c22f772095a6f5a6696c5c8c9d6bba3,Use of diffusion tension imaging in the evaluation of pediatric concussions.,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate whether quantitative metrics of white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were different in patients presenting to our clinic with persistent symptoms after a concussion.


DESIGN
Matched control retrospective study.


SETTING
Primary not-for-profit Institution.


PATIENTS
Consecutive patients seen at a primary care institution's Sports Concussion Clinic for sport-related concussion that underwent diffusion tensor imaging. Interventions (Independent variables): Type of sports, days from Injury, number of symptoms, weeks out when Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) ordered, history of psychological issues, length of symptoms, age, sex, MRI imaging data.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Difference in white matter FA and MD.


RESULTS
Seventeen concussion patients, ages 9 and 17 (averageâ€¯=â€¯12.5 years; medianâ€¯=â€¯13 years, 11 males and 6 females), were matched with age and gender controls who had an MRI following a complaint of headache. Patients reported an average of 11.5 concussion symptoms, out of a total possible 22 and were seen at an average of 30 days post injury. No region met tract based spatial statistics criteria for significant differences between concussed and healthy control groups (all pâ€¯>â€¯0.05). Similarly, when comparing group averages from the atlas based regional summaries, no region met the 0.2 false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for significant differences (the smallest unadjusted p-values were 0.02 for MD and 0.14 for FA).


CONCLUSIONS
Our results did not show measurable diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) changes with standard clinical data acquisition and quantitative processing for the individual patient. At this time DTI should not be considered a technique that can diagnose concussion within an individual subject.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Emma K Satchell"", ids = ""6126624""); list(name = ""S D Friedman"", ids = ""145496072""); list(name = ""Viviana Bompadre"", ids = ""4445647""); list(name = ""Andrew Poliakov"", ids = ""47609550""); list(name = ""Assaf Oron"", ids = ""47006607""); list(name = ""Thomas M Jinguji"", ids = ""14771507"")",,,Musculoskeletal science & practice,42,"

An HIV amino acid sequence is measured from each volunteer who acquires HIV, and these sequences are multiply aligned together with the reference HIV sequence represented in the vaccine. We develop genome scanning methods to identify HIV positions at which the amino acids in sequences from infected vaccine recipients tend to be more divergent from the corresponding reference amino acid than the amino acids in sequences from infected placebo recipients. Such analysis can help guide the sequence design of antigens to include in HIV vaccines. We consider five test statistics for comparing amino acid divergences between groups, based on Euclidean, Mahalanobis, and KullbackLeibler measures. Weights are incorporated to reflect biological information contained in different amino acid positions and substitutions. Position-wise p-values are obtained by approximating the null distribution of the test statistics either by a permutation procedure or by nonparametric estimation. Modified Bonferroni and false discovery rate procedures that exploit the discrete nature of the genetic data are used to infer statistically significant signature positions.

af06ee87e0d456391eac61e710f9657583906c1d,Controlling the local false discovery rate in the adaptive Lasso.,"The Lasso shrinkage procedure achieved its popularity, in part, by its tendency to shrink estimated coefficients to zero, and its ability to serve as a variable selection procedure. Using data-adaptive weights, the adaptive Lasso modified the original procedure to increase the penalty terms for those variables estimated to be less important by ordinary least squares. Although this modified procedure attained the oracle properties, the resulting models tend to include a large number of ""false positives"" in practice. Here, we adapt the concept of local false discovery rates (lFDRs) so that it applies to the sequence, Î»n, of smoothing parameters for the adaptive Lasso. We define the lFDR for a given Î»n to be the probability that the variable added to the model by decreasing Î»n to Î»n-Î´ is not associated with the outcome, where Î´ is a small value. We derive the relationship between the lFDR and Î»n, show lFDR =1 for traditional smoothing parameters, and show how to select Î»n so as to achieve a desired lFDR. We compare the smoothing parameters chosen to achieve a specified lFDR and those chosen to achieve the oracle properties, as well as their resulting estimates for model coefficients, with both simulation and an example from a genetic study of prostate specific antigen.",2013,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Joshua N.

However, there is currently no consensus regarding diagnostic techniques. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein profile of DLBCL and identify a potential novel method for the early diagnosis of patients with DLBCL at high risk for subsequent CNS involvement. The CSF proteomic profiling of patients with DLBCL and a control group were compared using label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Gene Ontology and pathway analyses were conducted using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. The protein interactions were analyzed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database. In the present study, a total of 53 differentially expressed proteins with >1 log2 fold change (false discovery rate <0.01, P<0.05) were identified and quantified. These proteins appeared to be involved in platelet degranulation, innate immune response and cell adhesion. Two hub gene network modules were obtained by protein-protein interaction network analysis. Of these proteins, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) and proenkephalin (PENK) were significantly decreased in the CSF of patients with DLBCL, which appeared to be correlated with CNS involvement. The findings of the present study indicate that decreased expression levels of SPARC and PENK in the CSF may serve as early-phase biomarkers to evaluate the risk of CNS involvement in patients with DLBCL, enabling clinicians to offer prophylactic therapy at the time of diagnosis.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaobei Liu"", ids = ""48032762""); list(name = ""Fei Mo"", ids = ""48012588""); list(name = ""Hao Zeng"", ids = ""143642822""); list(name = ""Sha Zhu"", ids = ""47474634""); list(name = ""Xuelei Ma"", ids = ""145453302"")",,1f4b6675e23ae220a2200fb7583bcefcbd7d4a75; 3e98b363ee442c93c93be72cb318cf9419434273; b282dcb6ea02307036eac3cbb41acfd9128ccb9d; 5d5537d237217ebfcbdcaba46cfe6cb4921e27cd; 35066cb04cc8f19d80dc1089f94db10525c6a820; 4e572e3f708fb81c495fd8930e744b1e6d3da769; f895dee9e48845825aa042778f8c5cc452640754; 898353f0d43c3efb94dbf3b3205a1109919555e6; 63918fd47ecef2aa99bf950ba51717928da3808d; 539511d3397f9b0d66db43228868683e347e8fdb; a0caa87e0964d36530811c4bcb3ecd8f0f9f9fbf; 328de8a182906ca01160984a035a1f5018ef607f; b73db93ec996fe0d984934892fb6357271a61dc2; 3aaab512515d196e52d0bf368d32f8d1e42f937c; 41e66e20ed0b27bc5fb310d56f7591b024bc1a38; c10fe571fe08173708a2f0e86c84384d8d34d2e4; 22eb3fe583bd3e9435360e462bb81d9e9c417c12; b4b2d3e54dc78c66ab083e18b9e86ebc4a0f5d4f; 26e4d4386493995cc0b36ac83861bc98b3a259e9; 62fac7dddd19a61902708124ed7c92369ace20ea; 4c785b168af174d1483c8705085392931b853059; 981b9765e8cefd4112dd5cc5068164729587e786; 83d926dd842432c1db3df4256c67f05cb579db6a; 0756b0cf2ee6e90219c39f221c728ec8ae212553; c47468f3e2c7e2da140ab329c5dbfcc72b250cdf; 020c0ed2547553a04767c26527c2186123d8dbcb; a378f63eaf695ac957515415b365945d7b0fdee6; 282cd00d5c43838833398765dd2434f771ded400; 6d69b780c10a1b0cb24cb1df73b25899f94b312a; 434011a6ec084ad0650f3ea7c614dccfcffc53ab; d28ce4651681a45b68e0a6633c2e740626f5bfcf; 5c9dbb68fd8d1c04c4fc6c3907fcbd9059f836f0; e37e7753644db78d44cea6a0352635d7222675c8; cadf0ecbeb601edee146520985005a3856d07eb4; d6c596a20f5274cccc486f25f72eb2ca1559c7e5; 16bdfd1a0b82c6cdcaaed2e98279982d38d5441b; 4d55078679d29fd0f64267d2a4177afb9626d5a9; 171140a85be77990a5121b726e11e9a8dc9afefc; 721cbb0d0e8da9007924f75c228ba3e5e029e7a8; bbcc5ec72688351e4eb25d974d89edf318e9b22c; 1d87d04bc6d86ad2057a859ed5f6ce21e88ddd56; 3c4bab0e3768903ae5b0a8daf93ee0ef474eac25; 9f0599c1f771a4ce1902f2be85ac3f1b8bdafcd6; 6fe719298582e8c4d14ec641978a6df267d24135; 64c338fbad4f2bd3ac0eccb59224a416cac2e0be,Biomedical Reports,11,70 - 78
f7fcae42b5c406061e9aa2fdf1483737fc602ac5,"Identification of novel variants associated with osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes and potentially pleiotropic loci using pleiotropic cFDR method.","AIMS
Clinical and epidemiological findings point to an association between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and osteoporosis. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been fruitful in identifying some loci potentially associated with osteoporosis and T2D respectively. However, the total genetic variance for each of these two diseases and the shared genetic determination between them are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to identify novel genetic variants for osteoporosis and/or T2D.


METHODS
First, using a pleiotropic conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method, we analyzed two GWAS summary data of femoral neck bone mineral density (FN_BMD, nâ€¯=â€¯53,236) and T2D (nâ€¯=â€¯159,208) to identify novel shared genetic loci. FN_BMD is an important risk factor for osteoporosis. Next, to explore the potential functions of the identified potential pleiotropic genes, differential expression analysis was performed for them in monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as these cells are relevant to the etiology of osteoporosis and/or T2D. Further, weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to identify functional connections between novel pleiotropic genes and known osteoporosis/T2D susceptibility genes by using transcriptomic expression datasets in bone biopsies (E-MEXP-1618) and pancreatic islets (GSE50397). Finally, multi-trait fine mapping for the detected pleiotropic risk loci were conducted to identify the SNPs that have the highest probability of being causal for both FN_BMD and T2D.


RESULTS
We identified 27 significant SNPs with cFDR<0.05 for FN_BMD and 61 SNPs for T2D respectively. Four loci, rs7068487 (PLEKHA1), rs10885421 (TCF7L2), rs944082 (GNG12-AS1 (WLS)) and rs2065929 (PIFO||PGCP1), were found to be potentially pleiotropic and shared between FN_BMD and T2D (ccFDR<0.05). PLEKHA1 was found differentially expressed in circulating monocytes between high and low BMD subjects, and PBMCs between diabetic and non-diabetic conditions. WGCNA showed that PLEKHA1 and TCF7L2 were interconnected with multiple osteoporosis and T2D associated genes in bone biopsy and pancreatic islets, such as JAG, EN1 and CPE. Fine mapping showed that rs11200594 was a potentially causal variant in the locus of PLEKHA1. rs11200594 is also an eQTL of PLEKHA1 in multiple tissue (e.g. peripheral blood cells, adipose and ovary) and is in strong LD with a number of functional variants.


CONCLUSIONS
Four potential pleiotropic loci were identified for shared genetic determination of osteoporosis and T2D. Our study highlights PLEKHA1 as an important potentially pleiotropic gene. The findings may help us gain a better understanding of the shared genetic determination between these two important disorders.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yuan Hu"", ids = ""143876039""); list(name = ""Li-jun Tan"", ids = ""2668355""); list(name = ""Xiang-ding Chen"", ids = ""2259300""); list(name = ""Jonathan Greenbaum"", ids = ""39598482""); list(name = ""Hong-Wen Deng"", ids = ""144156424"")",2a72d24a1dd04027e50496d6a11a1d81052246f2,,Bone,117,"

d19f5b4ebe2ccd8d460235c5afdd4a0d5afd6363,Plasma Amino Acids and Incident Type 2 Diabetes in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease.,"OBJECTIVE
Altered plasma amino acid levels have been implicated as markers of risk for incident type 2 diabetes; however, amino acids are also related to established diabetes risk factors. Therefore, potential for confounding and the impact from competing risks require evaluation.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We prospectively followed 2,519 individuals with coronary artery disease but without diabetes. Mixed Gaussian modeling identified potential for confounding. Confounding, defined as a change in effect estimate (â‰¥10%), was investigated by comparing amino acid-incident diabetes risk in a Cox model containing age and sex with that in models adjusted for potential confounders (BMI, estimated glomerular filtration rate, HDL cholesterol, triacylglycerol, C-reactive protein), which were further adjusted for plasma glucose, competing risks, and multiple comparisons (false discovery rate = 0.05, Benjamini-Hochberg method). Finally, component-wise likelihood-based boosting analysis including amino acids and confounders was performed and adjusted for competing risks in order to identify an optimal submodel for predicting incident diabetes.


RESULTS
The mean age of the source population was 61.9 years; 72% were men. During a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 267 incident cases of diabetes were identified. In age- and sex-adjusted models, several amino acids, including the branched-chain amino acids, significantly predicted incident diabetes. Adjustment for confounders, however, attenuated associations. Further adjustment for glucose and multiple comparisons rendered only arginine significant (hazard ratio/1 SD 1.21 [95% CI 1.07-1.37]). The optimal submodel included arginine and asparagine.


CONCLUSIONS
Adjustment for relevant clinical factors attenuated the amino acid-incident diabetes risk. Although these findings do not preclude the potential pathogenic role of other amino acids, they suggest that plasma arginine is independently associated with incident diabetes. Both arginine and asparagine were identified in an optimal model for predicting new-onset type 2 diabetes.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Adrian McCann"", ids = ""49659705""); list(name = ""Lasse Melvaer Giil"", ids = ""117299158""); list(name = ""Arve Ulvik"", ids = ""4373317""); list(name = ""Reinhard Seifert"", ids = ""7820344""); list(name = ""Eirik Wilberg Rebnord"", ids = ""7294295""); list(name = ""Eva.

84b7594dd606fe36f630ee0fdbadf5d8f7ac7c2e,An empirical bayes adjustment to increase the sensitivity of detecting differentially expressed genes in microarray experiments,"MOTIVATION
Detection of differentially expressed genes is one of the major goals of microarray experiments. Pairwise comparison for each gene is not appropriate without controlling the overall (experimentwise) type 1 error rate. Dudoit et al. have advocated use of permutation-based step-down P-value adjustments to correct the observed significance levels for the individual (i.e. for each gene) two sample t-tests.


RESULTS
In this paper, we consider an ANOVA formulation of the gene expression levels corresponding to multiple tissue types. We provide resampling-based step-down adjustments to correct the observed significance levels for the individual ANOVA t-tests for each gene and for each pair of tissue type comparisons. More importantly, we introduce a novel empirical Bayes adjustment to the t-test statistics that can be incorporated into the step-down procedure. Using simulated data, we show that the empirical Bayes adjustment improved the sensitivity of detecting differentially expressed genes up to 16%, while maintaining a high level of specificity. This adjustment also reduces the false non-discovery rate to some degree at the cost of a modest increase in the false discovery rate. We illustrate our approach using a human colon cancer dataset consisting of oligonucleotide arrays of normal, adenoma and carcinoma cells. The number of genes with differential expression level declared statistically significant was about 50 when comparing normal to adenoma cells and about five when comparing adenoma to carcinoma cells. This list includes genes previously known to be associated with colon cancer as well as some novel genes.

R code for the empirical Bayes adjustment and step-down P-value calculation via resampling are available from the supplementary web-site.

9ed99795d598030804eda4246b6530913dc38ffd,A Concept-Wide Association Study of Clinical Notes to Discover New Predictors of Kidney Failure.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Identifying predictors of kidney disease progression is critical toward the development of strategies to prevent kidney failure. Clinical notes provide a unique opportunity for big data approaches to identify novel risk factors for disease.


DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS
We used natural language processing tools to extract concepts from the preceding year's clinical notes among patients newly referred to a tertiary care center's outpatient nephrology clinics and retrospectively evaluated these concepts as predictors for the subsequent development of ESRD using proportional subdistribution hazards (competing risk) regression. The primary outcome was time to ESRD, accounting for a competing risk of death. We identified predictors from univariate and multivariate (adjusting for Tangri linear predictor) models using a 5% threshold for false discovery rate (q value <0.05). We included all patients seen by an adult outpatient nephrologist between January 1, 2004 and June 18, 2014 and excluded patients seen only by transplant nephrology, with preexisting ESRD, with fewer than five clinical notes, with no follow-up, or with no baseline creatinine values.


RESULTS
Among the 4013 patients selected in the final study cohort, we identified 960 concepts in the unadjusted analysis and 885 concepts in the adjusted analysis. Novel predictors identified included high-dose ascorbic acid (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.48; 95% confidence interval, 2.80 to 10.70; q<0.001) and fast food (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.34; 95% confidence interval, 2.55 to 7.40; q<0.001).

To maximize the performance of the recently produced Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer, we have developed a protocol that combines improved sample preparation (including optimized cellular lysis by extensive bead beating) and chromatographic conditions (specifically, 30-cm capillary columns packed with 1.7-Î¼m bridged ethylene hybrid material) and the manufacture of a column heater (to accommodate flow rates of 350â€“375 nl/min) that increases the number of proteins identified across a single liquid chromatographyâ€“tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) separation, thereby reducing the need for extensive sample fractionation. This strategy allowed the identification of up to 4,002 proteins (at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR)) in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4741) over 70 min of LC-MS/MS analysis. Quintuplicate analysis of technical replicates reveals 83% overlap at the protein level, thus demonstrating the reproducibility of this procedure.

81142549fc4a15e3a991b78fb55bbe2dd47e3343,Spotlite: web application and augmented algorithms for predicting co-complexed proteins from affinity purification--mass spectrometry data.,"Protein-protein interactions defined by affinity purification and mass spectrometry (APMS) suffer from high false discovery rates. Consequently, lists of potential interactions must be pruned of contaminants before network construction and interpretation, historically an expensive, time-intensive, and error-prone task. In recent years, numerous computational methods were developed to identify genuine interactions from the hundreds of candidates. Here, comparative analysis of three popular algorithms, HGSCore, CompPASS, and SAINT, revealed complementarity in their classification accuracies, which is supported by their divergent scoring strategies. We improved each algorithm by an average area under a receiver operating characteristics curve increase of 16% by integrating a variety of indirect data known to correlate with established protein-protein interactions, including mRNA coexpression, gene ontologies, domain-domain binding affinities, and homologous protein interactions. Each APMS scoring approach was incorporated into a separate logistic regression model along with the indirect features; the resulting three classifiers demonstrate improved performance on five diverse APMS data sets. To facilitate APMS data scoring within the scientific community, we created Spotlite, a user-friendly and fast web application. Within Spotlite, data can be scored with the augmented classifiers, annotated, and visualized ( http://cancer.unc.edu/majorlab/software.php ). The utility of the Spotlite platform to reveal physical, functional, and disease-relevant characteristics within APMS data is established through a focused analysis of the KEAP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase.",2014,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dennis Goldfarb"", ids = ""38786537""); list(name = ""Bridgid E Hast"", ids = ""5132342""); list(name = ""Wei Wang"", ids = ""49336997""); list(name = ""Michael B.

a02cb4da204455552c9d77f8e04b8dbc88d6a8aa,Digestive tract microbiota of beef cattle that differed in feed efficiency.,"We hypothesized cattle that differed in BW gain had different digestive tract microbiota. Two experiments were conducted. In both experiments steers received a diet that consisted of 8.0% chopped alfalfa hay, 20% wet distillers grain with solubles, 67.75% dry-rolled corn, and 4.25% vitamin/mineral mix (including monensin) on a dry matter basis. Steers had ad libitum access to feed and water. In Exp. 1, 144 steers (age = 310 Â± 1.5 d; BW = 503 Â± 37.2 kg) were individually fed for 105 d. Ruminal digesta samples were collected from 8 steers with the greatest (1.96 Â± 0.02 kg/d) and 8 steers with the least ADG (1.57 Â± 0.02 kg/d) that were within Â± 0.32 SD of the mean (10.1 Â± 0.05 kg/d) dry matter. In Exp. 2, 66 steers (age = 396 Â± 1 d; BW = 456 Â± 5 kg) were individually fed for 84 d. Rumen, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon digesta samples were collected from 8 steers with the greatest (2.39 Â± 0.06 kg/d) and 8 steers with the least ADG (1.85 Â± 0.06 kg/d) that were within Â± 0.55 SD of the mean dry matter intake (11.9 Â± 0.1 kg/d). In both studies, DNA was isolated and the V1 to V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. Operational taxonomic units were classified using 0.03 dissimilarity and identified using the Greengenes 16S rRNA Gene Database. In Exp.1, there were no differences in the Chao1, Shannon, Simpson, and InvSimpson diversity indexes or the PERMANOVA (P = 0.57). The hierarchical test returned 6 clades as being differentially abundant between steer classifications (P < 0.05). In Exp. 2, Chao1, Shannon, Simpson, and InvSimpson diversity indexes and PERMANOVA between steer classified as less or greater ADG did not differ (P > 0.05) for the rumen, duodenum, ileum, cecum, and colon. In the jejunum, there tended to be a difference in the Chao1 (P = 0.09) and Simpson diversity (P = 0.09) indexes between steer classifications, but there was no difference in the Shannon (P = 0.14) and InvSimpson (P = 0.14) diversity indexes. Classification groups for the jejunum differed (P = 0.006) in the PERMANOVA. The hierarchical dependence false discovery rate procedure returned 11 clades as being differentially abundant between steer classifications in the jejunum (P < 0.05). The majority of the OTU were in the Families Corynebacteriaceae and Coriobacteriaceae. This study suggests that intestinal differences in microbiota of ruminants may be associated with animal performance.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""H. C.

d37b573ea891002d2e3f7d91df40a0afe8b05906,Detection of Neural Fates from Random Differentiation : Application of Support Vector MachineMin,"Embryonic stem cells can be differentiated into various types of cells, requiring a tight regulation of transcription. Biomarkers related to each lineage of cells are used to guide the differentiation into neural or any other fates. In previous experiments, we reported the guided differentiation (GD)-specific genes by comparing profiles of random differentiation (RD). Interestingly 68% of differentially expressed genes in GD overlap with that of RD, which makes it difficult for us to separate the lineages by examining several markers. In this paper, we design a prediction model to identify the differentiation into neural fates from any other lineage. From the profiles of 11,376 genes, 203 differentially expressed genes between neural and random differentiation were selected by random variance T-test with 95% confidence and 5% false discovery rate. Based on support vector machine algorithm, we could select 79 marker genes from the 203 informative genes to construct the optimal prediction model. Here we propose a prediction model for the prediction of neural fates from random differentiation which is constructed with a perfect accuracy.",2007,Biology,"list(name = ""Min-su Lee"", ids = ""46293710""); list(name = ""Jeong-Hyuck Ahn"", ids = ""121830919""); list(name = ""Woong-Yang Park"", ids = ""1718220"")",,,Genomics & Informatics,5,1-5

70df374a6f774db798522d600204c5b0e688e4be,Abstract 1649: Genome-wide association study of copy number variations in serous epithelial ovarian cancer susceptibility,"DNA copy number variations (CNVs) are a significant and ubiquitous source of human genetic variation. However, the influence of CNVs on cancer susceptibility remains poorly understood. Out of 83 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on cancer to date, only a few studies found significant associations on germline CNVs and cancer. Here we analyzed data from our ongoing two-stage GWAS of four North American case-control studies to test the hypothesis that CNVs in germline DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes may serve as risk factors for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). To reduce disease heterogeneity, we focused on the subset of cases with serous histology. The analysis was therefore based on 942 serous ovarian cancer patients and 1,682 healthy controls who were genotyped using the Illumina 610K quad array. Subjects with extreme noise and genomic waviness in log R ratio (LR) were excluded prior to segmentation; principal component analysis was performed to adjust for batch effects. CNV segmentation was performed on LR data from 22 autosomes using circular binary segmentation embedded in the Copy Number Analysis Module from Golden Helix SNP Variation Suite version 7. Copy number segment covariates were discretized based on the thresholds that signify a transition between copy number states (deletion/no deletion; duplication/no duplication) after the segmentation. Unconditional logistic regression on a log-additive model was used to evaluate the association between copy number states and serous EOC risk after adjusting for study sites. By comparing single marker copy number states at 388,958 SNPs on 22 autosomes, we observed a total of 134 SNPs significantly associated with risk of serous EOC with a p value below 10 âˆ’6 . Associations with deletion polymorphisms were observed on chromosomes 7, 8, 14, and 18 when controlling for false discovery rate at 1%; no duplication polymorphisms were significant. We observed a large deletion at chromosome 14 that occurred in 8.9% of cases but in only 3.9% of controls, with a p value of 5.59Ã—10 âˆ’8 (Odds Ratio (OR): 2.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.82-3.60). Another common deletion on chromosome 7 occurred in 8.8% of cases and only 4.3% of controls (p=3.83Ã—10 âˆ’6 ; OR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.60-3.10). Two additional regions on chromosomes 8 and 18 with deletion events less than 5% were also identified. Women who harbored the deletion on chromosome 8 were at lower risk of developing serous ovarian cancer (p=4.83Ã—10 âˆ’8 ; OR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01-0.30). Women who carried the deletion on chromosome 18 had an increased risk for serous EOC (p=9.04Ã—10 âˆ’7 ; OR: 7.26, 95% CI: 2.94-17.97). Further validation of these four regions using independent data sets is currently underway. In summary, this is the largest reported genome-wide study of CNVs and serous EOC risk. These preliminary results suggested that germline CNVs may play an important role in ovarian cancer susceptibility. Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

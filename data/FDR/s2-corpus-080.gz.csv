3cef43da16052e34f334e791e2b6b1fd081e8404,"Second Issue, 2017","After the successful publication of the first issue of Statistical Theory and Related Fields in August, we are very happy to see the second issue in print. We would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to all the supporters of this journal. Following the first issue, Statistical Theory and Related Fields continues to publish significant and original articles inmodern statistical theory and applications in natural, economical, medical and social sciences. The first article in the second issue by Li, Fine and Pencina is a review paper for the statistical analysis of diagnostic accuracy in a multi-category classification task. The paper reviews important statistical concepts formulti-category classification accuracy and their utilities, demonstrated with real medical examples and problem-based R code. The next three papers are in precision medicine and personalisedmedical treatments. Zhou, Dai, Zheng and Cai applied a non-parametric inverse probabilityweighted kernel estimating equation to provide accurate and dynamic age-specific risk prediction in precision medicine. Their approach facilitates the utilisation of predictors varying over an individualâ€™s lifetime, and allows borrowing information across individuals of similar ages. Xiong, Yu and Shao proposed a single-index contrast functionmodel for treatment recommendation in personalised medicine. They adopted a non-parametric kernel method to construct treatment rules that are asymptotically optimal. The short communication by Luo is an abstract of the authorâ€™s PhD thesis in the problem of finding a solution to the treatment assignment when there are multiple treatments. The next four articles are in the general area of Bayesian analysis. Caoâ€™s article provided a Bayesian functional enrichment analysis of high-throughput experiment results to identify genes or proteins with certain characteristics, gain more insights into the underlying biology, and provide functional interpretation for the identified genes or proteins. Jha, Li and Guha developed a cost-effective Markov chain Monte Carlo strategy for censored outcomes in a semiparametric Bayesian analysis, motivated by the study of breast cancer mortality rates in New Mexico. The results offered insights into differences in breast cancer mortality rates between ethnic groups, tumour grade and spatial effect of counties. The next article by Liang, Habiger and Min focused on the influence of a misspecified covariance structure on false discovery rate for the large-scale multiple testing problem. They evaluated the influence on the marginal distribution of local false discovery rate statistics related to Bayesian posterior probabilities, under both correctly specified and incorrectly specified models. Tang, Liu and Xu studied Bayesian and maximum-likelihood estimation based on data augmentationmethod in a zero-and-oneinflated Poisson model. The method was illustrated by the analyses of data-sets from Legionnairesâ€™ disease in Singapore and from accidental rates data in Detroit, Michigan. Partially linear or partially nonlinear models are important extensions of the traditional linear models in studying relationship between a response and some covariates. Que, Huang and Zhang in their article applied the generalised least square estimation and B-splinesmethod to estimate the link function and variance components related to random effects. Both theoretical and empirical results were derived. The paper by Li, Li and Tong proposed a sequential profile lasso method for screening the linear predictors in an ultrahigh-dimensional partially linear model. The proposed procedure can detect all relevant predictors with probability tending to one, regardless of whether the ultrahigh model involves a non-parametric part or not. An extended Bayesian information criterion was also added to select the best model among the models generated by the sequential profile lasso method. High-dimensional issue is also addressed in the next paper by Marino and Li in factor analysis of correlation matrices based on contemporary data for biomedical studies, disease surveillance and genetics, in which the number of variables may be much larger than the sample size. Motivated by the study of annual cancer mortality rate in the United States, the authors developed an approach based on group sequential theory to estimate the number of relevant factors to be extracted. To facilitate interpretation of the extracted factors, they used a Bayesian information criterion to produce a sparse factor loading representation. The Current Population Survey is the oldest household sample survey in the United States conducted monthly to provide estimates of employment, unemployment and other characteristics of the noninstitutionalised civilian population 16 years of age and older. In the paper by Cheng, Shao and Yu, they derived an estimation procedure that improves the currently used composite type estimator for monthly population total in terms of the mean-squared error of estimators.",2017,Political Science,"list(name = ""Jun Shao"", ids = ""145785170""); list(name = ""Dongchu Sun"", ids = ""2047310""); list(name = ""Danyu Lin"", ids = ""144164978"")",,,Statistical Theory and Related Fields,1,141 - 142
87d0852b07d7c676de2e6343412e208be01379d2,Diabetes and obesity-related genes and the risk of neural tube defects in the national birth defects prevention study.,"Few studies have evaluated genetic susceptibility related to diabetes and obesity as a risk factor for neural tube defects (NTDs). The authors investigated 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms among 9 genes (ADRB3, ENPP1, FTO, LEP, PPARG, PPARGC1A, SLC2A2, TCF7L2, and UCP2) associated with type 2 diabetes or obesity. Samples were obtained from 737 NTD case-parent triads included in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study during 1999-2007. Log-linear models were used to evaluate maternal and offspring genetic effects. After application of the false discovery rate, there were 5 significant maternal genetic effects. The less common alleles at the 4 FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms showed a reduction of NTD risk (for rs1421085, relative risk (RR) = 0.73 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62, 0.87); for rs8050136, RR = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.93); for rs9939609, RR = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.94); and for rs17187449, RR = 0.80 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.95)). Additionally, maternal LEP rs2071045 (RR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.60) and offspring UCP2 rs660339 (RR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.64) were associated with NTD risk. Furthermore, the maternal genotype for TCF7L2 rs3814573 suggested an increased NTD risk among obese women. These findings indicate that maternal genetic variants associated with glucose homeostasis may modify the risk of having an NTD-affected pregnancy.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Philip J Lupo"", ids = ""4370514""); list(name = ""Mark A Canfield"", ids = ""6825452""); list(name = ""Claudia Chapa"", ids = ""6140221""); list(name = ""Wei Lu"", ids = ""143844117""); list(name = ""A J Agopian"", ids = ""2257419""); list(name = ""Laura E.

7b61ee6caf3e3eee63e254d17c4457f6040118fb,Rowan Digital Works,"Introduction: The dynamic range of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid b (Ab1â€“42) measurement does not parallel to cognitive changes in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and cognitively normal (CN) subjects across different studies. Therefore, identifying novel proteins to characterize symptomatic AD samples is important. Methods: Proteins were profiled using a multianalyte platform by Rules Based Medicine (MAPRBM). Due to underlying heterogeneity and unbalanced sample size, we combined subjects (344 AD and 325 CN) from three cohorts: Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Penn Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research of the University of Pennsylvania, and Knight Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis. We focused on samples whose cognitive and amyloid status was consistent. We performed linear regression (accounted for age, gender, number of apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 alleles, and cohort variable) to identify amyloid-related proteins for symptomatic AD subjects in this largest ever CSFâ€“based MAP-RBM study. ANOVA and Tukeyâ€™s test were used to evaluate if these proteins were related to cognitive impairment changes as measured by mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Results: Seven proteins were significantly associated with Ab1â€“42 levels in the combined cohort (false discovery rate adjusted P , .05), of which lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), prolactin (PRL), resistin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have consistent direction of associations across every individual cohort. VEGF was strongly associated with MMSE scores, followed by pancreatic polypeptide and immunoglobulin A (IgA), suggesting they may be related to staging of AD. Discussion: Lp(a), PRL, IgA, and tissue factor/thromboplastin have never been reported for AD diagnosis in previous individual CSFâ€“based MAP-RBM studies. Although some of our reported analytes are related to AD pathophysiology, otherâ€™s roles in symptomatic AD samples worth further explorations. 2015 The Authors.

98bd19aef5eff0ac139d68feb707049ca877453b,Effects of dietary sodium on metabolites: the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium Feeding Study.,"Background: High sodium intake is known to increase blood pressure and is difficult to measure in epidemiologic studies.Objective: We examined the effect of sodium intake on metabolites within the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Trial)-Sodium Trial to further our understanding of the biological effects of sodium intake beyond blood pressure.Design: The DASH-Sodium Trial randomly assigned individuals to either the DASH diet (low in fat and high in protein, low-fat dairy, and fruits and vegetables) or a control diet for 12 wk. Participants within each diet arm received, in random order, diets containing high (150 nmol or 3450 mg), medium (100 nmol or 2300 mg), and low (50 nmol or 1150 mg) amounts of sodium for 30 d (crossover design). Fasting blood samples were collected at the end of each sodium intervention. We measured 531 identified plasma metabolites in 73 participants at the end of their high- and low-sodium interventions and in 46 participants at the end of their high- and medium-sodium interventions (N = 119). We used linear mixed-effects regression to model the relation between each log-transformed metabolite and sodium intake. We also combined the resulting P values with Fisher's method to estimate the association between sodium intake and 38 metabolic pathways or groups.Results: Six pathways were associated with sodium intake at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 0.0013 (e.g., fatty acid, food component or plant, benzoate, Î³-glutamyl amino acid, methionine, and tryptophan). Although 82 metabolites were associated with sodium intake at a false discovery rate â‰¤0.10, only 4-ethylphenylsufate, a xenobiotic related to benzoate metabolism, was significant at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold (P < 10-5). Adjustment for coinciding change in blood pressure did not substantively alter the association for the top-ranked metabolites.Conclusion: Sodium intake is associated with changes in circulating metabolites, including gut microbial, tryptophan, plant component, and Î³-glutamyl amino acid-related metabolites.

7be0ad4c1fdfc77c3674317029d407495e7e118a,Quantitative iTRAQ secretome analysis of Aspergillus niger reveals novel hydrolytic enzymes.,"The natural lifestyle of Aspergillus niger made them more effective secretors of hydrolytic proteins and becomes critical when this species were exploited as hosts for the commercial secretion of heterologous proteins. The protein secretion profile of A. niger and its mutant at different pH was explored using iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics approach coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This study characterized 102 highly confident unique proteins in the secretome with zero false discovery rate based on decoy strategy. The iTRAQ technique identified and relatively quantified many hydrolyzing enzymes such as cellulases, hemicellulases, glycoside hydrolases, proteases, peroxidases, and protein translocating transporter proteins during fermentation. The enzymes have potential application in lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysis for biofuel production, for example, the cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes glucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase, alpha-glucosidase C, endoglucanase, alpha l-arabinofuranosidase, beta-mannosidase, glycosyl hydrolase; proteases such as tripeptidyl-peptidase, aspergillopepsin, and other enzymes including cytochrome c oxidase, cytochrome c oxidase, glucose oxidase were highly expressed in A. niger and its mutant secretion. In addition, specific enzyme production can be stimulated by controlling pH of the culture medium. Our results showed comprehensive unique secretory protein profile of A. niger, its regulation at different pH, and the potential application of iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics for the microbial secretome analysis.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sunil S Adav"", ids = ""36859925""); list(name = ""An Li"", ids = ""46757320""); list(name = ""Arulmani Manavalan"", ids = ""7013664""); list(name = ""Peter Punt"", ids = ""144871575""); list(name = ""Siu Kwan Sze"", ids = ""145270496"")",0e71df429f220eb18d1c97dfdc2d3df0f41e340d; b9d447c3da5d542919b70cbb7f7a2bb6a92e73ec; 768e875140bfba9beb4d351d13c24b12acfe45a1; a7637002b922212b73fcaeb8625fb70bdef3dcd8; cfb7765c21640a2afaef8f1f36af62260e9e4ec5; a518326e9cfbd0e2a7581500705ca272c621dd30; b44c08e9c7922ed5f117c5b6677c106c6ef6917d; 2ab90bb83163cabb3e46b744294dd61a560301f0; f38e540094fb664c0ccb745ccd44f03b0b096cc9; bf31ac5cb4a18cc027fd06e03a0b494533a2e36f; 22b3c4128f2bd8f2d835f40836d9bb4ff0ff1b87; 0061f23a6f388cefaf25e60e6615da2cd4005008; df82663d69a3ccbe6a820e2c724ae7a087bc01d3; 023f8596082f0123f500395fb99b5f19a7eb8b34; fe3e66f9619368a4bc0ade5e84b6ad89ed0157de; bc64f55f2ddec4b8694847789d19bf15af1526c5; c721f99408ea86acaacf2956b7bba6e01e889c18; 02d3c48fcddb65c71d72f2a62dfb3ae36b9544b1; ee11b5415741dcef8480a49ff7db969e1793b80b; 2b30f16e904bde845bde39951e6d9b3924ff965f; 7f11bb6c7a88ad58993bb33378c4579fe002307c; 85b3686f8d22867a1df2b8edf77ed7f2dfc6d27d; 48e125c4c888160bdad5d68a8fe58869f88a9c72; 9803a9e007c023747411a585d4bbf411005608f5; d0079af3a8a1769647e83328336313f4b17ac62b; 3015fd36ef9e30e5dc11c2c313dc1df18613ed36; b7172d411bed59a7381bb63c82a7bcc084dfbb7e; 53229c8d6bea3a63fc2c63e8904e3c9e9aefbc75; 037dc8be935c0e195805cbd5b3a643290d47f908; fc70364182272d78ddc7ebe9972bdd873bc63f10; 70a9a6cef8fbe9a767bade23046c51c677ad948b; 48a34cb18d0f5182612860142f8378eeea7f3f70; 1cc5cf74098067ce774a6ff0bf6987e331c763d2; 3d870f16a3998c6ed7ec24057b6c325d0837a77a; 8ed61d0499619714a8b4496ce6a8f44405245905; 0de6c42c5094f95eb5c133a020cf9ec3f6166e33; 2921ea623964388d1934e010f65bda54ab6ef648; 7a86d4cfb455cb6f364140bc006f7fd470adf444; b0dcfa686acb4627dbb568ab0507adb2299a3be5; 6c8083fc0cee9bf40a11a41abfd9c2ee6e7e3abf; 76d4e32be2d4bd0a2f322769c5b4098d4e829b1d; a7a288deb77f328947092c48514ecb183cdc8569; 29093e494d7cd53f4de476c4bbf32d922e422bf5; befdf8e73ba1c604117078907aa3075c039fc427; b2dbec1339532a68ce534efbedf2fd64205e0cf6; 3d3cfe8f23179806ee59e078a0208544bec58772; fd9823a42204c42cf67436a0c6fe63d91dd577eb; 68c103be39f9042390b54c1257992a4a211ad1fa; 63c2f5a8689fe89c61bf75a96657f7403abcf450; 7ee3f62d9672a83f39a9110986c3829dc375f5b9; 4c6962b6ab4fab261cf4ee2105a9cabac751405f; cb92ef47c0ffa7b33bbf21155c6209a60343a704; 56d668a1164739629ecd30cf258df8580ffe265f; c2e6e5d0197e3d84c797bd90e4a8f58354c9755c; 4e68d8d19afa2c4399fc022d8845880568ea0e85; da7bf77b3afa8d3cc3e71b18cbf5b8fe63b610c2; 81afd0683124c16407395d42927c163fcf47a79c; 8ae464328a40574d0747cb4d766320027c781c83,,Journal of proteome research,9 8,"

One of impediments to optimal management of this condition is a lack of biomarkers that forecast development of renal disease or that can be used to determine the response to therapy. Objectives In this study we used gene expression microarrays to contrast the gene expression profile in active lupus patients with and without nephritis to identify potential biomarkers and immune mechanisms associated with nephritis. Methods Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0ST arrays were used to assay gene expression in total RNA isolated from blood archived in PAXgene tubes for 38 active SLE patients with â‰¥4 ACR SLE classification criteria (25 biopsy proven nephritis, 13 active without nephritis) and 17 healthy controls. Data were analyzed with linear modeling, with corrections for multiple testing. Results were validated in a largely independent cohort of 22 healthy controls and 170 SLE patients (129 active (89 with and 40 without nephritis), 41 nephritis in remission), using Nanostring technology. Results Comparison of gene expression between healthy controls and all SLE patients revealed 27 genes that were increased >1 log 2 fold-change in SLE, the majority of which (25) were IFN-induced. When active SLE patients with and without nephritis were compared, there were 25 probes that demonstrated a >1 log 2 fold-change with a false discovery rate of q Conclusions Patients with lupus nephritis have higher levels of LDG gene expression than those without nephritis. Given the high rate of spontaneous NETosis in this cell population, the findings are consistent with the concept that high levels of NETosing neutrophils promote renal disease in SLE.

77df186a0526f51952e12ec26d59ad0cce73cf4b,Direct identification of base-paired RNA nucleotides by correlated chemical probing.,"Many RNA molecules fold into complex secondary and tertiary structures that play critical roles in biological function. Among the best-established methods for examining RNA structure are chemical probing experiments, which can report on local nucleotide structure in a concise and extensible manner. While probing data are highly useful for inferring overall RNA secondary structure, these data do not directly measure through-space base-pairing interactions. We recently introduced an approach for single-molecule correlated chemical probing with dimethyl sulfate (DMS) that measures RNA interaction groups by mutational profiling (RING-MaP). RING-MaP experiments reveal diverse through-space interactions corresponding to both secondary and tertiary structure. Here we develop a framework for using RING-MaP data to directly and robustly identify canonical base pairs in RNA. When applied to three representative RNAs, this framework identified 20%-50% of accepted base pairs with a <10% false discovery rate, allowing detection of 88% of duplexes containing four or more base pairs, including pseudoknotted pairs. We further show that base pairs determined from RING-MaP analysis significantly improve secondary structure modeling. RING-MaP-based correlated chemical probing represents a direct, experimentally concise, and accurate approach for detection of individual base pairs and helices and should greatly facilitate structure modeling for complex RNAs.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Andrey Krokhotin"", ids = ""49356752""); list(name = ""Anthony M Mustoe"", ids = ""5773410""); list(name = ""Kevin M.

The objective of this study was to identify metabolites within the uterine environment from populations of uniform and diverse porcine conceptuses as they transition between spherical, ovoid, and tubular conceptuses during the initiation of embryo elongation. White crossbred gilts (nâ€‰=â€‰38) were bred at standing oestrus (designated Day 0) and again 24â€‰h later and randomly assigned to collection group. At Day 9, 10, or 11 of gestation, reproductive tracts were collected immediately following harvest and flushed with 40â€‰mL of RPMI-1640 media. Conceptus morphologies were assessed from each pregnancy to assign to 1 of 5 treatment groups based on these morphologies: (1) uniform spherical (nâ€‰=â€‰8); (2) diverse spherical and ovoid (nâ€‰=â€‰8); (3) uniform ovoid (nâ€‰=â€‰8); (4) diverse ovoid and tubular (nâ€‰=â€‰8); and (5) uniform tubular (nâ€‰=â€‰6). Subsequently uterine flushings from these pregnancies were submitted for non-targeted profiling by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) techniques. Raw spectral data were processed using the XCMS package in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and features were clustered using RAMclustR. Unsupervised multivariate principal component analysis was performed in R using pcamethods package, and univariate ANOVA was performed in R with a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate adjustment. Principal component analysis of the GC-MS and UPLC-MS data identified 153 and 104 metabolites, respectively. Of the identified metabolites, 51 and 71 metabolites from the GC-MS and UPLC-MS analysis, respectively, corresponded to known compounds. After false discovery rate adjustment of the GC-MS and UPLC-MS data, 38 and 59 metabolites from the GC-MS and UPLC-MS analysis, respectively, differed (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in uterine flushings from pregnancies for the 5 conceptus stages. Some metabolites were greater (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in abundance for uterine flushings containing earlier stage conceptuses (i.e. spherical) such as uric acid, tryptophan, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, and L-tryosine. In contrast, some metabolites were greater (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in abundance for uterine flushings containing later stage conceptuses (i.e. tubular) such as creatinine, serine, isovaleryl-I-carnitine, and lauric diethaolamide. These data illustrate several putative metabolites that change within the uterine milieu as porcine embryos transition between spherical, ovoid, and tubular conceptuses.

1098fb0241ce5cd3c07df145a506da5617018ee0,Identifying and Assessing Interesting Subgroups in a Heterogeneous Population,"Biological heterogeneity is common in many diseases and it is often the reason for therapeutic failures. Thus, there is great interest in classifying a disease into subtypes that have clinical significance in terms of prognosis or therapy response. One of the most popular methods to uncover unrecognized subtypes is cluster analysis. However, classical clustering methods such as k-means clustering or hierarchical clustering are not guaranteed to produce clinically interesting subtypes. This could be because the main statistical variability--the basis of cluster generation--is dominated by genes not associated with the clinical phenotype of interest. Furthermore, a strong prognostic factor might be relevant for a certain subgroup but not for the whole population; thus an analysis of the whole sample may not reveal this prognostic factor. To address these problems we investigate methods to identify and assess clinically interesting subgroups in a heterogeneous population. The identification step uses a clustering algorithm and to assess significance we use a false discovery rate- (FDR-) based measure.

77020dcc63217c29fab47ef09a349a56873730b4,An Integrated Mass-Spectrometry Pipeline Identifies Novel Protein Coding-Regions in the Human Genome,"BACKGROUND
Most protein mass spectrometry (MS) experiments rely on searches against a database of known or predicted proteins, limiting their ability as a gene discovery tool.


RESULTS
Using a search against an in silico translation of the entire human genome, combined with a series of annotation filters, we identified 346 putative novel peptides [False Discovery Rate (FDR)<5%] in a MS dataset derived from two human breast epithelial cell lines. A subset of these were then successfully validated by a different MS technique. Two of these correspond to novel isoforms of Heterogeneous Ribonuclear Proteins, while the rest correspond to novel loci.


CONCLUSIONS
MS technology can be used for ab initio gene discovery in human data, which, since it is based on different underlying assumptions, identifies protein-coding genes not found by other techniques. As MS technology continues to evolve, such approaches will become increasingly powerful.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Danny A.

0e619d9f15654317046721f1d4b67d5f009de2c0,A framework for Multi-A(rmed)/B(andit) Testing with Online FDR Control,"We propose an alternative framework to existing setups for controlling false alarms when multiple A/B tests are run over time. This setup arises in many practical applications, e.g. when pharmaceutical companies test new treatment options against control pills for different diseases, or when internet companies test their default webpages versus various alternatives over time. Our framework proposes to replace a sequence of A/B tests by a sequence of best-arm MAB instances, which can be continuously monitored by the data scientist. When interleaving the MAB tests with an an online false discovery rate (FDR) algorithm, we can obtain the best of both worlds: low sample complexity and any time online FDR control. Our main contributions are: (i) to propose reasonable definitions of a null hypothesis for MAB instances; (ii) to demonstrate how one can derive an always-valid sequential p-value that allows continuous monitoring of each MAB test; and (iii) to show that using rejection thresholds of online-FDR algorithms as the confidence levels for the MAB algorithms results in both sample-optimality, high power and low FDR at any point in time.

3933ccf5cbf1c481de88e441d6ac052f87950a14,Focussed microarray analysis of apoptosis in periodontitis and its potential pharmacological targeting by carvacrol.,"OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to perform a landscape analysis of apoptosis-related genes/proteins and to study the differential gene expression by analysing array data from periodontitis patients and, second, to evaluate the anti-apoptotic effects of carvacrol, a monoterpenoid phenol, in vitro.


DESIGN
A gene/protein interaction network model 'APOP' was developed by using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) version 9.05. Differential gene expression was determined by using the limma package from R and false discovery rate (FDR). With ViaComplex software, gene expression was plotted over the network. The anti-apoptotic effect of carvacrol was tested on sorbitol-treated HaCaT cells, by using a commercial kit for caspase-3 activity.


RESULTS
The 'APOP' model characterised the landscape of interactions between apoptosis-related genes/proteins in silico. Forty-nine out of 70 genes from this model, such as CSF2RB, NFKBIE, ENDOG, CASP10 and CASP3, were differentially expressed (corrected p-value<0.05) in periodontitis samples when compared to those of healthy controls. In addition, carvacrol (0.43%) was able to inhibit the pro-apoptotic effects induced by sorbitol (0.3M), as seen by the reduction in caspase-3 activity on HaCaT cells.


CONCLUSION
Our results suggest that caspase-3 can be a target protein to inhibit periodontitis-associated apoptosis of epithelial cells and that carvacrol has therapeutic potential as an anti-apoptotic agent.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Fares ZeidÃ¡n-ChuliÃ¡"", ids = ""1397980119""); list(name = ""Mervi Gursoy"", ids = ""120790906""); list(name = ""Ben-Hur Neves de Oliveira"", ids = ""40696776""); list(name = ""Daniel Pens Gelain"", ids = ""5278878""); list(name = ""Eija KÃ¶nÃ¶nen"", ids = ""5457397""); list(name = ""Ulvi Kahraman Gursoy"", ids = ""5757108""); list(name = ""JosÃ© ClÃ¡udio Fonseca Moreira"", ids = ""144154253""); list(name = ""Veli-Jukka Uitto"", ids = ""35114127"")",a73726072374102d98ad197802c1c2b3fb412e2a; 7e37f240ce98e80af672d9d275cc33b81fff9a29; a22996af67b1aed0ffa9a34c15ba605a05cf6abc; 87a9b702d1c01be74abc17e585e44508e94ace2d; 0cc51d4a4880f1b85b0062b6af63bcd46f8c9d3f; 1799d19c7062724572d130f01873e02e8e8bf73b; 31be6b942106fed3f482cd1c9227ad4c49f88393; 44cd6bc228621c9a183bb6824ceb90640682926f; 548c6368a46481e6815ef2807e09e8ba2d4e311a; 8e31640fde7fd6a1cb539ec88d4b5820c33197da; 438d9a7d427d2465a7cc93b635d890cabbcc62fc,,Archives of oral biology,59 5,"

2f9ec331f40afcf7b4b6cffe4b354fde8f9a0e1b,Coordinate Based Meta-Analysis of Functional Neuroimaging Data; False Discovery Control and Diagnostics,"Coordinate based meta-analysis (CBMA) is widely used to find regions of consistent activation across fMRI studies that have been selected for their functional relevance to a given hypothesis. Only reported coordinates (foci), and a model of their spatial uncertainty, are used in the analysis. Results are clusters of foci where multiple studies have reported in the same spatial region, indicating functional relevance. There are several published methods that perform the analysis in a voxel-wise manner, resulting in around 10(5) statistical tests, and considerable emphasis placed on controlling the risk of type 1 statistical error. Here we address this issue by dramatically reducing the number of tests, and by introducing a new false discovery rate control: the false cluster discovery rate (FCDR). FCDR is particularly interpretable and relevant to the results of CBMA, controlling the type 1 error by limiting the proportion of clusters that are expected under the null hypothesis. We also introduce a data diagnostic scheme to help ensure quality of the analysis, and demonstrate its use in the example studies.

278a5314461a71ecd0aa93ae01a653a487944bcb,"A comprehensive evaluation of SAM, the SAM R-package and a simple modification to improve its performance","BackgroundThe Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) is a popular method for detecting significantly expressed genes and controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Recently, it has been reported in the literature that the FDR is not well controlled by SAM. Due to the vast application of SAM in microarray data analysis, it is of great importance to have an extensive evaluation of SAM and its associated R-package (sam2.20).ResultsOur study has identified several discrepancies between SAM and sam2.20. One major difference is that SAM and sam2.20 use different methods for estimating FDR. Such discrepancies may cause confusion among the researchers who are using SAM or are developing the SAM-like methods. We have also shown that SAM provides no meaningful estimates of FDR and this problem has been corrected in sam2.20 by using a different formula for estimating FDR. However, we have found that, even with the improvement sam2.20 has made over SAM, sam2.20 may still produce erroneous and even conflicting results under certain situations. Using an example, we show that the problem of sam2.20 is caused by its use of asymmetric cutoffs which are due to the large variability of null scores at both ends of the order statistics. An obvious approach without the complication of the order statistics is the conventional symmetric cutoff method. For this reason, we have carried out extensive simulations to compare the performance of sam2.20 and the symmetric cutoff method. Finally, a simple modification is proposed to improve the FDR estimation of sam2.20 and the symmetric cutoff method.ConclusionOur study shows that the most serious drawback of SAM is its poor estimation of FDR. Although this drawback has been corrected in sam2.20, the control of FDR by sam2.20 is still not satisfactory. The comparison between sam2.20 and the symmetric cutoff method reveals that the relative performance of sam2.20 to the symmetric cutff method depends on the ratio of induced to repressed genes in a microarray data, and is also affected by the ratio of DE to EE genes and the distributions of induced and repressed genes. Numerical simulations show that the symmetric cutoff method has the biggest advantage over sam2.20 when there are equal number of induced and repressed genes (i.e., the ratio of induced to repressed genes is 1). As the ratio of induced to repressed genes moves away from 1, the advantage of the symmetric cutoff method to sam2.20 is gradually diminishing until eventually sam2.20 becomes significantly better than the symmetric cutoff method when the differentially expressed (DE) genes are either all induced or all repressed genes. Simulation results also show that our proposed simple modification provides improved control of FDR for both sam2.20 and the symmetric cutoff method.",2007,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shunpu Zhang"", ids = ""33687207"")",123c5cbbe80f694152fbf4610f307691757502ca; ce1b58eba9048c3fe3d04e692c0a8bfac0cf207f; 946be46c3fcbc32e4cecf83cd59a1a30e3ecb7a5; 33d239b4745b403f7cba55f1a3a7343c0eeb028c; 3af90c33d543de68f8a23de1f2d60e591d241b86; 3d1e29dc677d2e1f408072bd4302a58f9bde6191; 182ab9b79361fc6a5f9f66b76c3e76f7bf7c5c89; 94722e7079b958808da104f78c4aad17e2c9155b; c2191ca9eefa0d633520d5ad5067da3a90df6935; 69e74e6e9578a2b7005a5ca53c8fe2a3b2519586; 84e655c41979df57b972211592948e83d6b997ed; 2f252faf562ce0a16637fe70c21eb1d265f0e539; 3b476ef48f8075ae0e9c3b10ce8b063d6644cb6d; 2400eec1e90977468a17c7dcf4aed9b787ea7d6b; 7be92d0c375be4ada2b767465408a842948094d4; c93d5c0c5d26f2e5e1820f94baa3495a1025cbff; e54f5b148d4fb9e69f168b18374ed18bc782de25; 872de9f436c79ca3cc4b3409803c5f3c18ef2617; 53692a034fbc4ead4442f67fe678a5ce522d9b49; aa51194008b4777dab5d186595a1afeafda896f7; 66300009d746cf33a29c004c157e4fba8ebf59ec; ada5ff312a8c6113a90c2b28f78b653ca992ad4e; df0c6a1f8a15cf383fd3c0b6d71f092ce41382a4; 8dfaa645d96583d84c19caf94c8286708edfe09d; 099a6434e2aa752d4f0fc3e519e3b8ee1f74986c; 160d219dd9bdbfd223763a837cf869e86182d16d; dc4a6da8ed035c75e0a172497758bbb85d9e22f0; 7c14cf04925c2c3c3850860e1e0eff43d0a7fc71; f451055cf40c5ee52f197c14a382d4501fbb2220; 3e935076d88ef61345088ef4564391d670049c0b; 0eaa7362a2726579cd18730037b0a34a45f5c8b2; 838c4a8019296eb1ec099776ff85c01e0aca6631; 51ea2b6264670f45bed181066d5465f2832a3824; 9da004d2ea574a43be2b38f1d9d0b063ba9a8626; 11704665357504dd0bdf896e3136b1b986b471f7; 16c5a40a98df214bc8e353805ab021fca300e00e; 417dd3aabc51b30cccd819947d2a366f82ce7102; 4dfc7249fc29d612476cc396cea9839a550f5efb; 4edca09b9ef87c2d0c240f594b911ddfa9148be2; 211baf571de0c40e0e632b108fdc2bf92c6ad23d; 0a3bd4058dbb7e831bef52950494201861c2070a; 3fe9746fa2c52023d82988e3b7f1235195c757d4; a6cae558a4410123e3e827f6c4a79fbf647e1a2d; 49e906c2aad2a82f869bea4ae3bbd47d68b72f68; 70f46efa761b2acda257e9675794e843c8dd48d9; 221ecb00909b65dbcd4d8ec78365563993635689; 32b59fa4a8bbd8d8d097967ff7e523ef12234b1a; 7fe9aceb591e9f4da46a7fa6f6e2dbc875dd9503; 4904e2cfdbd079789580da89f8c4fef11d98d813; ec18b774531e2ad7bf363c1598dd4e4b7fff218a; 7285033a0d6a15072ba9be7257152dca3bdd2e48; f86b2bd4ac3080b565337da33e806cb72edfccdc; 687186174d2fb660e182edd489be50cbf649a4b3; 27fb224bd2dedede495078940d1f0cb8407f0b8b,d65ab6603658382103f1883c30fc0dea849667fb; c67af957b4ceef21eb55922e9dd6ad8635915855; daecec8eaebb89098d6432d9181da89518a7a443; fa233cb81da77f2de8f84e9ab9aa0a2670f4eb8a; 9393721879cae0d9becd88aa9392800ec71dd005; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 7be801da3bb1274cd75faeef551a30473144c4be; c413dcf29a2bee0118497b0dbea99b863e9eca23; 4d65e9ceb2981fc081f42544b5110ccd07d28976; 65c4f601132902530ff0217b21e321e9c7e7812a; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; a380e424e71ee719ef326d38f2baee2f32752d23; 4f2b48d49c81233aba44396af5b9848f04ed283d; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; 869e99037469fa9caa7b62e913b689812e6767e5; e205a9cf860a45b34941cc0c0e0ac953134606a8; 4a5ce7f196aba136ec79b8a444da10f8dcc4684e; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; d42337ecab378287fbcd60b42e5ceb5b67b6f59a; 686abad29d835044cf97434c3c0fb9f80321c856; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 40181f754876ee63ea2df10a64d357772e3aab4e; f628674ca6108606f9fc50a187510d92be334273; 40902c80298752cfba32714f8dd29966ba016016,BMC Bioinformatics,8,230 - 230
6d17d2b1d9ab1ad5d20bdb6c6f8945293770b8e3,Comparison of the myometrial transcriptome from singleton and twin pregnancies by RNA-Seq,"Preterm birth is recognized as the primary cause of infant mortality worldwide. Twin pregnancies are significantly more at risk of preterm birth than singleton pregnancies. A greater understanding of why this is and better modes of treatment and prevention are needed. Key to this is determining the differing pathophysiological mechanisms of preterm birth in twins, including the role of the myometrium and premature uterine contraction. We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of human myometrium from singleton and twin pregnancies at term (> 37+0 weeks) and preterm (< 37+0 weeks), collected during pre-labour Caesarean Section. RNA-Seq libraries were prepared from polyA-selected RNA and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway enrichment were conducted using R software. Significance was determined with a false discovery rate-adjusted P value of <0.05. Only 3 DEGs were identified between gestational age-matched singleton and twin myometrium and only 1 DEG identified between singleton term and twin preterm tissues. Comparison of singleton preterm myometrium with twin term myometrium however, revealed 75 down-regulated and 24 up-regulated genes in twin myometrium. This included genes associated with inflammation and immune response, T cell maturation and differentiation and steroid biosynthesis. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses for biologically relevant processes and functions also revealed several terms related to inflammation and immune response, as well as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine receptor signalling. Data indicate that little or no differences exist in the transcriptome of singleton and twin myometrium when matched for gestational age. The significant up- and down-regulation of genes identified between preterm singleton and twin myometrium at term may point to transcriptome changes associated with the chronic levels of uterine stretch in twin pregnancy or genes associated with the myometrium transitioning to labour onset.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sarah Arrowsmith"", ids = ""6722425""); list(name = ""Yongxiang Fang"", ids = ""144498446""); list(name = ""Andrew Sharp"", ids = ""12328556"")",,7edabebf99481892f6bf8e46c2d4dda3e770e4f3; bed08797a5fe1bd430b61e6bf12a4b7d701f4c50; 05fd84ab7add451989047d7139ef2be8b4a011a5; 288da883e83a19a69d56f504f8adb18b8469b433; 9799f1b4518431492e8c3826e4e5ba48c0e857e1; bf5d495e4a6fc4c9f217f9f7ab150b02b3fee108; 209b4eff277a5251d3534f27c86d57d332148f85; 7f69eef048b4bfbc00c1c118b442b9a64c119eb5; 17d01d94092942d99625e2df0614a03977f64960; ad375d4a4c9acf49d59c8309a62c2dd761d90149; f5c5cb804f8c5be29e8ef993aec7a7c7bbc125ce; 47bf693914918d50336f5a0a2b57ba2ba968a240; e7a33417e2b555a79e0da83070762539beb5ede5; d800051737b5c00b5a749e4d483c76b36fa2dd90; b4a8a7cbaf4dc65c006ebaa1e58ff383eacd0471; 08b14e8cb27b1c07fab81ceae105e6a869c5a2d4; 9f4c7143620818edae35fe7a24bf6b345e2b6fb2; 178ca51034bfcf8bdfc8f13ee11bd1cb5056d118; 202469af6d26214eb9020f716ba57d9a4962f7b6; b9faa752f97dc641758e69894f7a2441fea30363; 0def7180ce03e8ad5d8ff6beefa103099db67916; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 3dfa7a1a3b04b5b735ed97cbdc6d66c3f0f149ff; 24c48471d4cfb6f5f8c913ef511a48bd4a9a3ba0; 722ffe78e2ef7b719c231adcc76b839b40d1fca9; 7008e59a43a1cb853939c23717596f2739d18d39; 737b1648520d22db32cf63e6a470f517027e0ba2; 07e6a4f30ac87f36f80d2b4d7d3e4bfed8a7f3d6; 5b9c6a2785995d4aa944006b8b5d579aa4a39d96; 6035c361f75239618a711d8091a60973f707babd; 7fb0c3f096b11fed69fb1b3b10ffa532880c18b8; 38f92b0630fb0d9607f9a5d32955cf75c311be87; 21163324c782b78aaaaa0661d3ff7a454514170a; 966f808917ea3db62facfeb429bb7a2febb25e01; 940444d9797f5308d23c5f1ffa1102fa9b161540; 29d6e76251156a9eb04242d255946eac38ff9790; 8bfbb7caf055906d5cae11f2814adab8c057d0f4; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; d1ca52b7ad4e075603f4b1d40128d9f01524d60e; c0484c00c96179e86445d6a9dd972e7ed7d86a3d; 22032525bb94ff8916abe6056436650144799268; b0302c35b7ac4f81e57720864a934976ef40dbb1; b13ea7067419f5ae8131c779c88d8937d459f54e; 1d35e386f0abfeb8115d0ccadf84b11837c2d1b1; 613a32f07fb1f5ad67511b37bc7ddc943fd69510; 8fd7336c4a46235cc987e54a7b29aa9e56838da0; 87ccc438b0c73fcfdea48485fcdb091a8ecaa89c; 73737f6bfcbcf475d13c49662b0a0abaa8591b95; 8e78fb30b4fcf2d1582223cd875b344eb4b3c87b,PLoS ONE,15,
f648bfa5c86e33f603119fa51a83a9c58c71a56f,Maternal-fetal metabolic gene-gene interactions and risk of neural tube defects.,"Single-gene analyses indicate that maternal genes associated with metabolic conditions (e.g., obesity) may influence the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). However, to our knowledge, there have been no assessments of maternal-fetal metabolic gene-gene interactions and NTDs. We investigated 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms among 7 maternal metabolic genes (ADRB3, ENPP1, FTO, LEP, PPARG, PPARGC1A, and TCF7L2) and 2 fetal metabolic genes (SLC2A2 and UCP2). Samples were obtained from 737 NTD case-parent triads included in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study for birth years 1999-2007. We used a 2-step approach to evaluate maternal-fetal gene-gene interactions. First, a case-only approach was applied to screen all potential maternal and fetal interactions (n = 76), as this design provides greater power in the assessment of gene-gene interactions compared to other approaches. Specifically, ordinal logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each maternal-fetal gene-gene interaction, assuming a log-additive model of inheritance. Due to the number of comparisons, we calculated a corrected p-value (q-value) using the false discovery rate. Second, we confirmed all statistically significant interactions (q < 0.05) using a log-linear approach among case-parent triads. In step 1, there were 5 maternal-fetal gene-gene interactions with q < 0.05. The ""top hit"" was an interaction between maternal ENPP1 rs1044498 and fetal SLC2A2 rs6785233 (interaction OR = 3.65, 95% CI: 2.32-5.74, p = 2.09Ã—10(-8), q=0.001), which was confirmed in step 2 (p = 0.00004). Our findings suggest that maternal metabolic genes associated with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance and fetal metabolic genes involved in glucose homeostasis may interact to increase the risk of NTDs.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Philip J Lupo"", ids = ""4370514""); list(name = ""Laura E.

5b47d1d8f14b710edc7954ce091a27275cace1db,Deep proteomic profiling of human carotid atherosclerotic plaques using multidimensional LC-MS/MS.,"PURPOSE
To increase the proteome coverage of human atherosclerotic plaques and identify low-abundance proteins that may have important functions during the development and progression of atherosclerosis.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Thirty-eight human carotid atherosclerotic plaques were pooled into two samples and analyzed in triplicate using offline multidimensional LC-MS/MS. The collected fractions of trypsin-digested peptides from Electrostatic Repulsion-Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (ERLIC) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a Q Exactive (Thermo Fisher, MA, USA).


RESULTS
A total of 4702 proteins were identified from atherosclerotic plaques at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%, of which 3846 were identified with at least 2 unique peptides. Many pathways related to the development and progression of atherosclerosis were identified, such as atherosclerosis signaling, toll receptor signaling pathway and inhibition of matrix metalloproteases. Many low-abundance proteins with important functions in atherosclerosis that were previously unidentifiable using mass spectrometry based proteomics methods, such as TGF-Î², interleukins and other growth factors, were identified confidently from plaques.


CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
This study has substantially increased the coverage of the atherosclerotic plaque proteome which represents a leap forward in understanding of plaque composition, development and progression. The identification of many low-abundance proteins may also facilitate biomarker discovery.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Piliang Hao"", ids = ""4636318""); list(name = ""Yan Ren"", ids = ""47811176""); list(name = ""Gerard Pasterkamp"", ids = ""2232982""); list(name = ""Frans L.

1bff133d82088f99d8a2bb3da2ec52e990afdf2e,Differential Gene Expression in the Oxyntic and Pyloric Mucosa of the Young Pig,"The stomach is often considered a single compartment, although morphological differences among specific areas are well known. Oxyntic mucosa (OXY) and pyloric mucosa (PYL, in other species called antral mucosa) are primarily equipped for acid secretion and gastrin production, respectively, while it is not yet clear how the remainder of genes expressed differs in these areas. Here, the differential gene expression between OXY and PYL mucosa was assessed in seven starter pigs. Total RNA expression was analyzed by whole genome Affymetrix Porcine Gene 1.1_ST array strips. Exploratory functional analysis of gene expression values was done by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, comparing OXY and PYL. Normalized enrichment scores (NESs) were calculated for each gene (statistical significance defined when False Discovery Rate % <25 and P-values of NES<0.05). Expression values were selected for a set of 44 genes and the effect of point of gastric sample was tested by analysis of variance with the procedure for repeated measures. In OXY, HYDROGEN ION TRANSMEMBRANE TRANSPORTER ACTIVITY gene set was the most enriched set compared to PYL, including the two genes for H+/K+-ATPase. Pathways related to mitochondrial activity and feeding behavior were also enriched (primarily cholecystokinin receptors and ghrelin). Aquaporin 4 was the top-ranking gene. In PYL, two gene sets were enriched compared with OXY: LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION and LIPID RAFT, a gene set involved in cholesterol-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane. The single most differentially expressed genes were gastrin and secretoglobin 1A, member 1, presumably located in the epithelial line, to inactivate inflammatory mediators. Several genes related to mucosal integrity, immune response, detoxification and epithelium renewal were also enriched in PYL (P<0.05). The data indicate that there is significant differential gene expression between OXY of the young pig and PYL and further functional studies are needed to confirm their physiological importance.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michela Colombo"", ids = ""35825216""); list(name = ""Davide Priori"", ids = ""3852775""); list(name = ""Paolo Trevisi"", ids = ""3901719""); list(name = ""Paolo Bosi"", ids = ""5414920"")",aa1828e7b9ece67949165f122d8f9ee8c3a1e069; 7ca15b12a5f9c72d2561fd0f0d87a9455ff1481d; 43db187776f5cdecceca00bfab552e8eebda0d2b; ada205796245504fc516fa52b85050fd0ac379f2; c9d2ac228852ae09fcb64aa9e5dd769a73b35060; 7806f3635a223aaf5990a1a89d87880d2cbb443c; 7bb9678eeb2c58f4e82efe9aab6e9aae07a1b0e5; a77bb05d40fc0b75954adf18ce5eeda6e8b0d453; 992adcfc914a525c630d348ad49858f9ab860f4f; 9b4f53c607add69023fb96ec940cce87c368e4e1; 60379650e21384fae1fef834349c35eade13cd3a,dba9316f02c0a519a886eddd832e151ee8e5e3ae; 9b9f1cb4fd9631f18f7e44a358a76e5584eeb9c2; 67003e33b66963bcf81596449fac5fcd48103f83; c0e0b78d9e4931c939dc078abd86717640025362; 32fef84caa4a4464615af54797facc03d1bac9aa; 4321d8227884cd72b70dc85caa7071a5e4e56339; 7b1b233f214f3a4b203dd360cc0dda967f315f83; 62326ac77a8a5bc03fb75a494ce78768c5ed39e2; 30edf27664d49c0440e8e70519074e88ca205863; 80eac4485478d01aa08d4ba58584593b5f5006d2; 19dc1208a3a99bb45b1bfa387567e323d843ae5c; 5671d79fb162ed293d9ade8cd56d1e82efaaa017; 5e01e1e49074c615461bf9191c57872593d1fa45; d49391aed697ec307994a172c255c7231070e237; 9f026d706543f3b79051876dfb3a8931c3fde294; ce419a3dcea1907cb74eeb65e078831215621119; cd599208325fa316b35f65985a83cde5a6d1a966; e49ff07998d40cb0f7d5a02b9f4318080742dc6f; 69488d8970c4f20d5f829e852b7c9ad06f067f13; 470b99f42b707e818e7e6a233ae5712800fc4631; 4f66a85e919d1fa94b5e983aed31ed7f19334ed2; 591053689de3a18c37f6d8c8d395fd9ad79447f2; 7c49ccbecf2cc15d3e32f602f41a8d3ed7326d72; db6e9173b87398b0e922569889562937a08b22ad; d4faa104e2dd4374816fe2e1a3435aef6f1fcc05; c4f31f3bd733e3a3b27c042e467dede3b9264542; 8b587ac4ecc7b513437924f91feebf28ba31013e; 80cd4049acee5105110d87ed960bbdc71d9df4dd; b9c2f00c5a1a1b801c30e997c9161f56a397d7c8; 29f8349307d1cc3d415b98a91e77a722d40623d1; 9b0f19085c9a1296837231055ce8baef80c9ad88; c0bd17e524ec51d7c3b44792c74137627daa85b4; 5277ebd9b0a9f5ca30267721c706b8cd8923b726; d99f30d1f970441ec496966f97bbc48bc7ea6ef8; 0d965590f743e0ee58575fe68a5222d68674c9d1; 70fed8edf3153d42bfcf4dedc288fe3cbe0cac45,PLoS ONE,9,
4fe83a025f66b9fd67e720a1561e5542fdbaf990,Efficient Stratified Testing Procedure for a False Discovery Rate,"The false discovery rate (FDR) has become a popular error measure in the large-scale simultaneous testing. When data are collected from heterogenous sources and form grouped hypotheses testing, it may be beneficial to use the distinct feature of groups to conduct the multiple hypotheses testing. We propose a stratified testing procedure that uses different FDR levels according to the stratification features based on p-values. Our proposed method is easy to implement in practice. Simulations studies show that the proposed method produces more efficient testing results. The stratified testing procedure minimizes the overall false negative rate (FNR) level, while controlling the overall FDR. An example from a type II diabetes mice study further illustrates the practical advantages of this new approach.",2015,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Seungbong Han"", ids = ""50618083""); list(name = ""Adin-Cristian Andrei"", ids = ""143658893""); list(name = ""Kam-Wah Tsui"", ids = ""2328919"")",,7e533ae2d40c0389f5e1c0a1f8383510fd62a0bf; 3f0a3a35e395a18e3e048d5f3b85914cf6e48b53; 6239771ec46a43ae98a48b17d0779b1336865ae3; e1dd7aab4aaa38940fd26f357e78f90099c8c112; a05f5a5c9fe1d8a44f5960571cc6f4fbb75d0d36; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; dd1b3822a5d94e1de43845a9917be3e6a4ebfbe4; 97e87a444ff1c5be4dc3dddcb7208112bbcc7534; 1dbfa2053ddb473fcb1558eb2f0358381f277a28; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 95686586f26d5a1d152db72f6283c7a73335a513; b34385fab890190a7937457061929718ef904b69; 75e35cd46cf8da8932c8dcaaf6b073107bb85492; 1db5c1d04f85e6886e51b6dde9bb047e2ace3334,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation,44,1117 - 1125
701cae7fb41417989c384bcd8268a620c4669ca4,Detecting Differential Expression in RNA-sequence Data Using Quasi-likelihood with Shrunken Dispersion Estimates,"Abstract Next generation sequencing technology provides a powerful tool for measuring gene expression (mRNA) levels in the form of RNA-sequence data. Method development for identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes from RNA-seq data, which frequently includes many low-count integers and can exhibit severe overdispersion relative to Poisson or binomial distributions, is a popular area of ongoing research. Here we present quasi-likelihood methods with shrunken dispersion estimates based on an adaptation of Smyth's (2004) approach to estimating gene-specific error variances for microarray data. Our suggested methods are computationally simple, analogous to ANOVA and compare favorably versus competing methods in detecting DE genes and estimating false discovery rates across a variety of simulations based on real data.",2012,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Steven P.

164d42406c69ae2a4b10f280c83d9d7c11f0feba,SuperSAGE digital expression analysis of differential growth rate in a European sea bass population,"Abstract One of the goals of the aquaculture industry is to understand and control growth associated traits through selective breeding. In the present study the molecular basis of growth heterogeneity in the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) was addressed. To establish growth heterogeneity in a group of hatchery bred sea bass individuals were tagged and their specific growth rates (SGR) determined at monthly intervals. Gene expression in the brain, liver and white muscle from fish with the most divergent sustained SGR (6 individuals of the first and last quartile) was assessed using SuperSAGE (Serial Analysis Gene Expression) combined with next generation SOLiD4 sequencing. A total of approx. 11 million edited tags (26â€¯bp), on average 2 million tags per SAGE library, that represented 47.071 unique transcripts were identified. Comparison of transcripts in fish with high and low SGR yielded 344, 698 and 601 differently expressed tags (0.01% false discovery rate and 4-fold change) in brain, liver and muscle, respectively. The tags were mapped onto the sea bass genome and approximately one third of the tags could be assigned to annotated genes. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed in liver, muscle and brain intricate gene expression changes in endocrine regulatory pathways involved in growth, metabolic and the stress axis, underlying divergent SGR in sea bass.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Bruno Louro"", ids = ""2782263""); list(name = ""Rute S.T.

dd654ebcd78755009b327b8d207df196e946f574,Comparison of Anthropometric Measures in US Military Personnel in the Classification of Overweight and Obesity.,"OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to determine (1) the level of agreement between BMI, circumference-based equation (CBE) measures, waist circumference (WC), and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measures and (2) whether BMI, CBE measures, or WC alone or in combination adequately reflects adiposity in military personnel compared with BIA.


METHODS
BMI from measured height and weight (using military overweight cutoffs in men [BMIâ€‰â‰¥â€‰27.5 kg/m2 ] and World Health Organization overweight cutoffs [BMIâ€‰â‰¥â€‰25.0 kg/m2 ]), BMI body fat percentage (BF%), WC, CBE BF%, and BIA BF% were collected. Respondents (Nâ€‰=â€‰389, 78% men) were categorized with normal fat versus overweight, obesity, or overfat. Levels of agreement and standard screening performance measures were compared between anthropometric measures and BIA.


RESULTS
World Health Organization BMI and BIA BF% classified the most men and women with overweight/obesity; WC with BMI (BMIâ€‰+â€‰WC) and WC alone classified the fewest men and women with overweight/obesity. Levels of agreement were all statistically significant and highest for BMI (men: Cohen's Îºâ€‰=â€‰0.711; women: Cohen's Îºâ€‰=â€‰0.814) and lowest for WC and BMIâ€‰+â€‰WC (all Cohen's Îºâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.270). BMIâ€‰+â€‰CBE performed best overall (sensitivityâ€‰=â€‰50.9%, false discovery rateâ€‰=â€‰5.4%).


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings support BMIâ€‰+â€‰CBE as an easy-to-implement combination to assess adiposity in the military.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Marissa M Shams-White"", ids = ""1403532902""); list(name = ""Kenneth K H Chui"", ids = ""47160662""); list(name = ""Patricia A Deuster"", ids = ""90519365""); list(name = ""Nicola M.

To directly characterize the effects of IFN-alpha in humans, we used microarrays to profile gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from hepatitis C patients treated with IFN-alpha. Seven patients were studied using two strategies: (1) in vivo: PBMCs were collected immediately before the first dose of IFN-alpha, and 3 and 6 hours after the dose; (2) ex vivo: PBMCs that were collected before the first IFN-alpha dose were incubated with IFN-alpha for 3 and 6 hours. The microarray datasets were analyzed with significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) to identify genes regulated by IFN-alpha. We identified 516 named genes up-regulated at least 2-fold, at a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 1%. In vivo and ex vivo studies generated similar results. No genes were identified as regulated differently between these 2 experimental conditions. The up-regulated genes belonged to a broad range of functional pathways and included multiple genes thought to be involved in the direct antiviral effect of IFN-alpha. Of particular interest, 88 genes directly relating to functions of immune cells were up-regulated, including genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, T-cell activation, lymphocyte trafficking, and effector functions, suggesting that IFN-alpha up-regulates multiple genes involving different aspects of immune responses to enhance immunity against hepatitis C virus. In conclusion, IFN-alpha-inducible genes can be identified in human PBMCs in vivo as well as ex vivo.

5cfa83e1781f4b76a6599e30d71a19eb5a25b92b,A case study on choosing normalization methods and test statistics for two-channel microarray data: Research Articles,"DNA microarray analysis is a biological technology which permits the whole genome to be monitored simultaneously on a single slide. Microarray technology not only opens an exciting research area for biologists, but also provides significant new challenges to statisticians. Two very common questions in the analysis of microarray data are, first, should we normalize arrays to remove potential systematic biases, and if so, what normalization method should we use? Second, how should we then implement tests of statistical significance? Straightforward and uniform answers to these questions remain elusive. In this paper, we use a real data example to illustrate a practical approach to addressing these questions. Our data is taken from a DNAâ€“protein binding microarray experiment aimed at furthering our understanding of transcription regulation mechanisms, one of the most important issues in biology. For the purpose of preprocessing data, we suggest looking at descriptive plots first to decide whether we need preliminary normalization and, if so, how this should be accomplished. For subsequent comparative inference, we recommend use of an empirical Bayes method (the B statistic), since it performs much better than traditional methods, such as the sample mean (M statistic) and Student's t statistic, and it is also relatively easy to compute and explain compared to the others. The false discovery rate (FDR) is used to evaluate the different methods, and our comparative results lend support to our above suggestions.

fa637fae17feebcad5e71dcc0a34211775eb24c1,Use of gene expression profile and mitotic index of metastatic melanoma lesions as an adjunct to TNM staging in predicting patient survival.,"9014 Background: Although remission rates for metastatic melanoma are generally very poor, some patients can survive for prolonged periods following metastasis. We used gene expression profiling of metastatic lesions to search for a molecular basis for this observation, and to develop improved methods for predicting patient survival.


METHODS
We analyzed gene expression profiles of 44 metastatic melanoma specimens collected from 38 patients (median follow-up of 20 months after surgery). We used the False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach to identify genes significantly associated with post-recurrence survival. We then evaluated matching H&E stained tissue samples for the presence of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) and mitotic index, (MI). Support vector machines and multi-variable Cox regression analysis was used to examine the relative ability of the pre-validated gene expression predictor, TILs, MI and TNM staging to predict survival.


RESULTS
We identified a group of approximately 300 genes associated with survival. Genes associated with immune response (ICOS, CD3d, ZAP70, TRAT1, TARP, GZMK, LCK, CD2, CXCL13, CCL19, CCR7, VCAM1 etc.) or with cell proliferation (PDE4D, CDK2, GREF1, NUSAP1, SPC24 etc.) were highly represented .Prolonged survival was associated with the elevated expression of immune response genes and decreased expression of genes associated with proliferation. Furthermore, any of the three additional parameters (pre-validated gene expression signature, TILs or MI) improved the ability of TNM staging to predict post-recurrence survival; MI was the most significant contributor (HR = 2.65, p = 0.003) followed by the gene expression signature (HR = 2.71, p = 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Gene expression profiling and MI of metastatic lesions can both be utilized to improve upon current staging of metastatic melanoma to predict patient survival. Gene expression signature and analysis of TILs indicate immune surveillance as a mechanism for prolonged survival in these patients.

In the current study, the authors evaluated physical, neurocognitive, and serologic markers for correlation with selfâ€reported fatigue before and after (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with earlyâ€stage breast cancer. METHODS: Women with AJCC TNM Stage Iâ€III breast cancer consented to assessment before and after the completion of 4 cycles of doseâ€dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Assessment included selfâ€reported fatigue (using the Brief Fatigue Inventory), depression (using the Center for Epidemiologic Studiesâ€“Depression Scale [CESâ€D]), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and 28 objective measures (grip strength in dominant and nondominant hands, 6â€minute walk, daily total energy expenditure, 14 neurocognitive tests, and 10 serologic markers). Generalized linear regression models of fatigue were constructed (1 model per marker), and adjusted for depression, timing before/after chemotherapy, menopausal status, obesity, and educational level. P values were adjusted to control the False Discovery Rate. RESULTS: Of 28 subjects, 3 withdrew without completing baseline assessments. Prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy data were available for the evaluation of physical measures (25 subjects aged 50.6 Â± 9.5 years), neurocognitive tests (22 subjects), and serologic markers (10 subjects). On covariateâ€adjusted analysis, interleukin (IL)â€12 was found to be associated with fatigue at both assessments (P<.01). Serum eotaxin (P < .01), ILâ€1RA (P < .01), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCPâ€1) (P<.01), and performance on 2 neurocognitive (Trail Making) tests (P<.01 and P = .02, respectively) were found to be inversely associated with fatigue before chemotherapy but not afterward, whereas daily energy expenditure, serum MCPâ€1, and serum macrophage inflammatory protein 1a (MIPâ€1a) were found to be associated with fatigue after receipt of chemotherapy but not before (P<.01 for each). The association between energy expenditure and fatigue was detectable only if an actively athletic subject with outlier values of energy expenditure was excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Serum ILâ€12 merits confirmatory testing as an objective, treatmentâ€independent measure of fatigue in patients with earlyâ€stage breast cancer. &NA; To identify objective measures of cancerâ€related fatigue, herein the authors evaluate physical, neurocognitive, and serologic markers for correlation with the Brief Fatigue Inventory before and after (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with earlyâ€stage breast cancer. Although several markers correlate with selfâ€reported fatigue at one assessment, only the cytokine interleukin 12 appears to correlate with fatigue both before and after chemotherapy.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Joanne E.

2ce1cb27951785d11b0be7620d148ff825fcdfde,Whole genome microarray analysis of gene expression in an imprinting center deletion mouse model of Prader-Willi syndrome.,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by loss of paternally expressed genes in the 15q11-q13 region. To further characterize alterations in gene expression in this classical obesity syndrome we used whole genome microarrays to study a PWS mouse model resulting from a paternally derived imprinting center (IC) deletion (PWS IC deletion). These mice die generally within 2-3 days of life (reflective of failure to thrive in infants with PWS) and therefore, the analysis was performed on RNA extracted from the whole brain of PWS IC deletion mice and normal littermates at less than 24 hr after birth. Of more than 45,000 probes examined, 26,471 (59%) were detected for further analysis, and 69 had a significant change in expression of at least 1.5-fold and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. Eight of the genes with differential expression were imprinted and from the PWS critical region (PWSCR). The three genes with the highest expression in the PWS IC mice were pro-opiomelanocortin (Pomc) and two transcripts of unknown function. Pomc knockout mice have been shown to develop obesity. Therefore, elevated Pomc RNA in PWS IC deletion neonatal mice may be an important genetic factor in the survival of these mice as it may affect eating behavior. Interestingly, Mc5r, a melanocortin receptor known to directly respond to Pomc expression changes, was upregulated as well. Mc5r is known to be involved with thermoregulation which is reportedly abnormal in PWS infants. These observations support a role for Pomc and the network of genes involved in regulating energy homeostasis in the early clinical findings of failure to thrive observed in PWS. Other notable patterns include three previously unstudied transcripts that are expressed only from the paternal allele under regulatory control of the IC and include AK013560, BB3144814, and BB182944 (whose genes are located in the mouse PWSCR on chromosome 7B). As expected, all the known paternally expressed genes from the PWSCR had detection signals below the threshold in the PWS IC deletion mice but were clearly detectable in control littermates. Several of the genes in this study were further examined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to confirm their expression status. Further analysis of gene expression in these mice may lead to novel pathways affected in PWS. These results, along with other recent reports, suggest that the cumulative effect of modest changes in expression of many genes, especially genes involved in energy metabolism, contribute to the failure to thrive of infants with PWS.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Douglas Bittel"", ids = ""2951546""); list(name = ""Nataliya Kibiryeva"", ids = ""4809614""); list(name = ""Steven G.

ac472e985a8082a5d3961dd2e1bccc884e947131,Influence of age on the association of GIRK4 with metabolic syndrome,"Background G protein-coupled inward rectifier K+ channel 4 (GIRK4) gene expressions have been implicated in the development of obesity, a key feature of metabolic syndrome (MetS). We investigated whether sequence variants of GIRK4 may represent metabolic risk factors for the Uygur Chinese population. Methods The entire GIRK4 gene, including all exons, the promoter and untranslated regions from 48 MetS individuals, was studied in order to identify genetic variations associated with the disorder. Targeted genotyping of four common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs11221497, rs6590357, rs4937391 and rs2604204) and one novel missense mutation (M210I) was performed using the TaqMan polymerase chain reaction method for 443 MetS and 786 non-MetS subjects. Results When all MetS cases were compared against all non-MetS controls, no significant association was found between the three SNPs (rs2604204, rs4937391 and rs6590357) and MetS status or metabolic traits. After adjustment, rs11221497 was associated with MetS (odds ratio (OR) [95% CI] = 0.731 [0.551â€“0.968], P= 0.029). Interestingly, when the MetS group was stratified into subclasses by age, an association was found for the three SNPs (rs2604204, rs4937391 and rs6590357) having estimated false discovery rates <0.001 and age of <50 y. After adjustment, the SNPs rs2604204, rs4937391 and rs6590357 were also associated with MetS in younger subjects: ORs [95% CI]: 1.678 [1.149â€“2.450], 1.839 [1.204â€“2.809] and 0.602 [0.379â€“0.958], respectively. All of the four SNPs showed a trend towards lower or higher metabolic traits (P< 0.05) in younger subjects. In addition, a newly identified missense mutation (M210I) was not specifically related with MetS.

The results are illuminating for understanding the long-term delivery of STC-1 would provide therapeutic rescue in more chronic models of retinal degeneration. On the other hand, from our perspective, the bioinformatics analyses need further context as the statistics for differential fold changes in expression data are not explained fully. For example, the authors seem to only consider gene expression values for detecting differentially expressed mRNA (differentially expressed genes, DEGs) of different group in mRNA microarray analyses. Due to the high false positives caused by a large number of probes and multiple comparisons, it seems essential to analyze microarray data properly to reach a reliable result by a statistical method. Only selecting genes by fold change in expression is not reliable and suitable for microarray analysis. We would like to suggest using specialized high-level microarray analysis such as Limma (Linear Models for Microarray Analysis) (Law et al., 2016), commonly used for statistical testing and analysis of differential expression data by using linear models, and choosing more than 1.5-fold expression changes and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 as the cutoff is an appropriate and conservative approach to obtain DEGs, in our view. Moreover, Significant Analysis of Microarray (Tusher et al., 2001) is another and considerable non-parametric statistical algorithm; a 2-fold expression change and FDR < 0.1 is a rational cutoff to obtain DEGs. Although the authors appear to perform additional analysis such as qPCR or other methodology for DEGs in order to verify the results of the microarray experiments from our reading of the article, it is impractical using qPCR or other technology to verify all DEGs. Choosing the optimal statistical approach (Chrominski and Tkacz, 2015) and obtaining accurate and convincing results of DEGs analysis are basis for further data analysis. We welcome the authors to offer further explanation of their data analysis and experimental approach. We suggest transcriptomics data-intensive research would benefit from these considerations and innovations in statistical and data analytical approaches.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chenyu Li"", ids = ""46651186""); list(name = ""Bin Zhou"", ids = ""51483278""); list(name = ""Ruixia Ma"", ids = ""38018975""); list(name = ""Xianghua Wang"", ids = ""50141413""); list(name = ""Yan Xu"", ids = ""40616890"")",,34a44f119c16dd966617645e5190bd5c08a64783,Experimental eye research,169,"

Intrauterine exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has been equivocally associated with birth weight, length and head circumference with limited attention to anthropometric endpoints such as umbilical circumference and limb lengths.


OBJECTIVE
To explore 76 prenatal maternal plasma EDC concentrations in a healthy obstetric cohort and 7 neonatal anthropometric endpoints by maternal race/ethnicity.


METHODS
The study cohort comprised 2106 (564 White, 549 Black, 590 Hispanic, 403 Asian) healthy pregnant women recruited from 12 U.S. clinical sites between 2009 and 2012 who were followed through delivery. Neonates underwent standardized anthropometric assessment (weight, length, head and umbilical circumference, and mid- upper arm and thigh length). Plasma EDC concentrations were quantified using high resolution gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. EDCs were log-transformed and rescaled by their deviations (SD) when modeled relative to neonatal endpoints using linear regression adjusting for age, education, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), serum cotinine, serum lipids for lipophilic chemicals, and a race/ethnicity interaction term; p-values had false discovery rate correction (<0.05).


RESULTS
The cohort comprised women aged 28 (SDâ€¯=â€¯5) years with normal BMIs (23.6â€¯kg/m2, SDâ€¯=â€¯3). Maternal EDC concentrations varied by self-identified race/ethnicity and neonatal outcomes, though no specific EDC was consistently associated with neonatal anthropometric outcomes across racial/ethnic groups. For the overall cohort, perfluorooctanoic acid was negatively associated with birth length per SD increase in concentration (Î²â€¯=â€¯-0.23â€¯cm; 95% CI -0.35, -0.10), while perfluorohexanesulfonic acid was negatively associated with umbilical circumference (Î²â€¯=â€¯-0.26â€¯cm; 95% CI -0.40, -0.13), perfluorodecanoic acid with arm length (-0.09â€¯cm; 95% CI -0.14, -0.04), and PCBs congeners 118/106 (-0.12â€¯cm; 95% CI -0.20, -0.04) and 146/161 (-0.14â€¯cm; 95% CI -0.23, -0.05) with thigh length, as were 7 other poly-and-perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs).


CONCLUSIONS
Among healthy pregnant women with low risk antenatal profiles and relatively low EDC concentrations, reductions in umbilical circumference and bone lengths may be a sensitive marker of intrauterine EDC exposure, particularly for PFAS.",2018,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Germaine M Buck Louis"", ids = ""3916760""); list(name = ""Shuyan Zhai"", ids = ""34661158""); list(name = ""Melissa M Smarr"", ids = ""6347182""); list(name = ""Jagteshwar Grewal"", ids = ""46475337""); list(name = ""Cuilin Zhang"", ids = ""50445801""); list(name = ""Katherine L.

01b59753e4890095895b99cdc24a06b5e2ec2d93,Development of PowerMap: a Software Package for Statistical Power Calculation in Neuroimaging Studies,"Although there are a number of statistical software tools for voxel-based massively univariate analysis of neuroimaging data, such as fMRI (functional MRI), PET (positron emission tomography), and VBM (voxel-based morphometry), very few software tools exist for power and sample size calculation for neuroimaging studies. Unlike typical biomedical studies, outcomes from neuroimaging studies are 3D images of correlated voxels, requiring a correction for massive multiple comparisons. Thus, a specialized power calculation tool is needed for planning neuroimaging studies. To facilitate this process, we developed a software tool specifically designed for neuroimaging data. The software tool, called PowerMap, implements theoretical power calculation algorithms based on non-central random field theory. It can also calculate power for statistical analyses with FDR (false discovery rate) corrections. This GUI (graphical user interface)-based tool enables neuroimaging researchers without advanced knowledge in imaging statistics to calculate power and sample size in the form of 3D images. In this paper, we provide an overview of the statistical framework behind the PowerMap tool. Three worked examples are also provided, a regression analysis, an ANOVA (analysis of variance), and a two-sample T-test, in order to demonstrate the study planning process with PowerMap.

Debate remains over whether DN represent progressive lesions from CMN. Through gene expression profiling and analysis of molecular gene signatures, our study revealed progressive increases in immune activation and regulation, along with pathways implicated in melanomagenesis, from CMN to DN to MM. Using criteria of 1.5-fold change and false discovery rate â‰¤0.05, we found differential expression of 7186 probes (6370 unique genes) with the largest difference detected between DN and MM from the standpoint of genomic melanoma progression. Despite progressive increases in the T-helper type 1 (Th1)-inducing gene (IL-12), RT-PCR indicated impaired Th1 or cytotoxic T-cell response (decreased IFN-Î³) in MM. Concordantly, our results indicated progressive increases in molecular markers associated with regulatory T cells, exhausted T cells and tolerogenic dendritic cells, including detection of increased expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) in dendritic cells associated with MM. All together, our findings suggest that the increased immunosuppressive microenvironment of melanoma may contribute to unhampered proliferation of neoplastic cells. In addition, the detection of increased markers associated with tolerogenic dendritic cells in MM suggests that targeting these suppressive immune cell types may represent an alternative avenue for future immunotherapy.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bernice Y Yan"", ids = ""12829755""); list(name = ""Sandra Garcet"", ids = ""50539298""); list(name = ""Nicholas Gulati"", ids = ""37398873""); list(name = ""Felix Kiecker"", ids = ""46339276""); list(name = ""Judilyn Fuentes-Duculan"", ids = ""1398155197""); list(name = ""Patricia Gilleaudeau"", ids = ""4600999""); list(name = ""Mary M Sullivan-Whalen"", ids = ""1398817655""); list(name = ""Avner Shemer"", ids = ""10392301""); list(name = ""Hiroshi Mitsui"", ids = ""48034658""); list(name = ""James G.

3120b66be6f9a0c3979a91a08df5fa4fbf5a152a,Evaluation of In Silico Multifeature Libraries for Providing Evidence for the Presence of Small Molecules in Synthetic Blinded Samples.,"The current gold standard for unambiguous molecular identification in metabolomics analysis is comparing two or more orthogonal properties from the analysis of authentic reference materials (standards) to experimental data acquired in the same laboratory with the same analytical methods. This represents a significant limitation for comprehensive chemical identification of small molecules in complex samples. The process is time consuming and costly, and the majority of molecules are not yet represented by standards. Thus, there is a need to assemble evidence for the presence of small molecules in complex samples through the use of libraries containing calculated chemical properties. To address this need, we developed a Multi-Attribute Matching Engine (MAME) and a library derived in part from our in silico chemical library engine (ISiCLE). Here, we describe an initial evaluation of these methods in a blinded analysis of synthetic chemical mixtures as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Non-Targeted Analysis Collaborative Trial (ENTACT, Phase 1). For molecules in all mixtures, the initial blinded false negative rate (FNR), false discovery rate (FDR), and accuracy were 57%, 77%, and 91%, respectively. For high evidence scores, the FDR was 35%. After unblinding of the sample compositions, we optimized the scoring parameters to better exploit the available evidence and increased the accuracy for molecules suspected as present. The final FNR, FDR, and accuracy were 67%, 53%, and 96%, respectively. For high evidence scores, the FDR was 10%.

c82f7770bca671e50d0fb1c94e7481d0b6d9635e,Association of Interleukin 6 Receptor Variant With Cardiovascular Disease Effects of Interleukin 6 Receptor Blocking Therapy: A Phenome-Wide Association Study,"Importance Electronic health record (EHR) biobanks containing clinical and genomic data on large numbers of individuals have great potential to inform drug discovery. Individuals with interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) who are not receiving IL6R blocking therapy have biomarker profiles similar to those treated with IL6R blockers. This geneâ€“drug pair provides an example to test whether associations of IL6R SNPs with a broad range of phenotypes can inform which diseases may benefit from treatment with IL6R blockade. Objective To determine whether screening for clinical associations with the IL6R SNP in a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) using EHR biobank data can identify drug effects from IL6R clinical trials. Design, Setting, and Participants Diagnosis codes and routine laboratory measurements were extracted from the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP); diagnosis codes were mapped to phenotype groups using published PheWAS methods. A PheWAS was performed by fitting logistic regression models for testing associations of the IL6R SNPs with 1342 phenotype groups and by fitting linear regression models for testing associations of the IL6R SNP with 26 routine laboratory measurements. Significance was reported using a false discovery rate of 0.05 or less. Findings were replicated in 2 independent cohorts using UK Biobank and Vanderbilt University Biobank data. The Million Veteran Program included 332 799 US veterans; the UK Biobank, 408 455 individuals from the general population of the United Kingdom; and the Vanderbilt University Biobank, 13 835 patients from a tertiary care center. Exposures IL6R SNPs (rs2228145; rs4129267). Main Outcomes and Measures Phenotypes defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Results Of the 332 799 veterans included in the main cohort, 305 228 (91.7%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 66.1 (13.6) years. The IL6R SNP was most strongly associated with a reduced risk of aortic aneurysm phenotypes (odds ratio, 0.87-0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.93) in the MVP. We observed known off-target effects of IL6R blockade from clinical trials (eg, higher hemoglobin level). The reduced risk for aortic aneurysms among those with the IL6R SNP in the MVP was replicated in the Vanderbilt University Biobank, and the reduced risk for coronary heart disease was replicated in the UK Biobank. Conclusions and Relevance In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated application of the PheWAS using large EHR biobanks to inform drug effects. The findings of an association of the IL6R SNP with reduced risk for aortic aneurysms correspond with the newest indication for IL6R blockade, giant cell arteritis, of which a major complication is aortic aneurysm.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tianxi Cai"", ids = ""91879489""); list(name = ""Yingyi Zhang"", ids = ""49890212""); list(name = ""Yuk-Lam Ho"", ids = ""31779600""); list(name = ""Nicholas B.

0bc79fc1786754e61d1390984234b211e5956cb6,Functional Enrichment Analysis by David in Transgenic MYCN Zebrafish Model,"Abstract 5114 

Introduction The MYCN oncogene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLH/LZ) transcription factor that is frequently overexpressed in hematologic malignancies neoplasms (including acute leukemia, T-cell lymphoma, and so on). MYCN acts as a poor prognostic marker to promote an aggressive phenotype. However, the mechanisms of action and pathways affected by MYCN are still largely unclear.

Methods We induced murine MYCN gene overexpression in embryonic zebrafish through heat-shock promoter and established stable germline Tg( MYCN:HSE:EGFP ) zebrafish. RNA was extracted at 3 days post fertilization from wild type (WT) and transgenic zebrafish F1 generation (TG) embryo hematopoietic cells, collected by the flow cytometer, for microarray analysis. The samples were processed and subsequently analyzed in triplicate on Zebrafish Oligo Microarrays (Agilent Technologies), containing 43, 554 sets of probe, at the Advanced Throughput Inc. The microarrays were scanned in an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner and the images were processed using Feature Extraction software. A False Discovery Rateâ‰¤0. 05 for overall interactions effect and P<0. 001 between comparisons were used to determine differentially expressed genes (DEG). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and DAVID performed the functional analysis of DEG.

Results Microarray analysis revealed 626 (342 genes up-regulated and 284 genes down-regulated) DEG that showed >2-fold change in TG comparing with that of WT. Using functional enrichment analysis by DAVID, several signaling pathways were regulated in TG samples ([Table 1][1]). MAPK signaling pathway was high activated through FGF , PDGF , BDNF and CACN high expression, promoting up-regulated of Ras and MKP , enhancing phosphorylation and leading to increase of cells proliferation. TGFÎ² signaling was inhibited by up-regulation of IFN A and Smad 6/7 , which negative control of TGF Î² R and Smad 2/3 . Further, we found that MYCN enhances the expression of skp2 , via decreased p21 and increased CDK2, promoting cell cycle progression ([Fig. 1][2]). In addition, overexpression of MYCN weakened the function of mismatch repair, base excision repair, while increased apoptosis pathway mediated by p53 (up-regulated Bid gene). Meanwhile, Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway was significantly up-regulated in TG fish.

Conclusions Overexpression of MYCN induced up-regulation of cell proliferation and Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway (as the Warburg effect in rapidly proliferating tumors), attenuation of repair function, all of which are phenomena associated with proliferation and malignancies transformation of blood cell feature.

We found that MYCN down-regulates p27kip1, p57kip2 and p21cip1 through up-regulate Skp2 , thus up-regulates CDK2 , CycA , CycB , CycD and CycE. All above changes shortened the time taken to progress through the cell cycle. Increased MARK signaling and decreased TGFÎ² signaling pathways also contributed to promote cell cycle. (Red star marks the up-regulated genes).

Severe liver steatosis is a known risk factor for increased ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and poor outcomes after liver transplantation (LT). This study aimed to identify steatosis-related molecular mechanisms associated with IRI exacerbation after LT.


METHODS
Paired graft biopsies (n = 60) were collected before implantation (L1) and 90 minutes after reperfusion (L2). The LT recipients (n = 30) were classified by graft macrosteatosis: without steatosis (WS) of 5% or less (n = 13) and with steatosis (S) of 25% or greater (n = 17). Plasma samples were collected at L1, L2, and 1 day after LT (postoperative [POD]1) for cytokines evaluation. Tissue RNA was isolated for gene expression microarrays. Probeset summaries were obtained using robust multiarray average algorithm. Pairwise comparisons were fit using 2-sample t test. P values 0.01 or less were significant (false discovery rate <5%). Molecular pathway analyses were conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool.


RESULTS
Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified for WS and S grafts after reperfusion. Comprehensive comparison analysis of molecular profiles revealed significant association of S grafts molecular profile with innate immune response activation, macrophage production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 signaling activation, recruitment of granulocytes, and accumulation of myeloid cells. Postreperfusion histological patterns of S grafts revealed neutrophilic infiltration surrounding fat accumulation. Circulating proinflammatory cytokines after reperfusion and 24 hours after LT concurred with intragraft-deregulated molecular pathways. All tested cytokines were significantly increased in plasma of S grafts recipients after reperfusion when compared with WS group at same time.


CONCLUSIONS
Increases of graft steatosis exacerbate IRI by exacerbation of innate immune response after LT.

1f994952ce599aff20bdb7a0bbb88df0b999db2e,Could neurophysiological measures help in understanding alexithymia in multiple sclerosis?,"Objectives Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) could have deficits in emotional processing. Among the latter, alexithymia could affect up to 53% of this population [2] ; it is a multicomponent personality construct that entails an operative thinking and difficulties in understanding and analyzing one's own feelings. Previous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have suggested aberrant interhemispheric transfer and GABAergic transmission behind alexithymia [3] , but none was performed in the context of MS. Methods Right-handed MS patients were enrolled if they had no contraindications to TMS. The Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) classified patients as alexithymic (scoreÂ >Â 55) and non-alexithymic. Socio-demographic, clinical and neuropsychological data were collected. The following TMS measures were obtained [1] : resting motor threshold, interhemispheric inhibition (interstimuli interval: 8, 10 and 12Â ms) and cortical silent period (CSP). The statistical analysis consisted of group comparison (alexithymic versus non-alexithymic) of socio-demographic, clinical and neuropsychological measures and correlation analysis (corrections with False Discovery Rate approach) between TAS scores and TMS measures. Results Twenty-two patients completed the study (nÂ =Â 10 alexithymic and nÂ =Â 12 non-alexithymic). Patients did not significantly differ with regard to socio-demographic, clinical or neuropsychological data. A significantly shorter CSP duration was observed among alexithymic patients (mean: 84.34Â Â±Â 49.73) compared to their non-alexithymic counterparts (mean: 159.33Â Â±Â 76.96).",2018,Psychology,"list(name = ""Samar S Ayache"", ids = ""2361237""); list(name = ""Jean-Pascal Lefaucheur"", ids = ""145908078""); list(name = ""Alain CrÃ©ange"", ids = ""4749923""); list(name = ""Moussa A Chalah"", ids = ""6023320"")",,2fe401d7848e3e0d2a887f3082520c7a5576fea1; a960c07b56d42364e56bcd93c6e94839d76b0ee3; a129fbb315667380de37b85686eaefb941ec102f,Neurophysiologie Clinique,48,
d2605179f15b524c63cef278b7140397c28af70c,AA-01 Phenome-wide association studies uncover hierarchy of autoantibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus,"Background Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous disease with diverse presentations. dsDNA antibodies associate with renal disease. Less is known about comorbidities in SLE patients without dsDNA antibodies. Using a large electronic health record (EHR) cohort, we sought to identify comorbidities that associate with dsDNA status. We used a technique that scans across EHR billing codes called phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to compare SLE patients with and without dsDNA antibodies. We also evaluated the relative importance of SLE specific autoantibodies on SLE criteria. Methods We used our validated SLE algorithm of â‰¥4 counts of the SLE ICD-9 code and ANA positive â‰¥1:160 while excluding dermatomyositis and systemic sclerosis ICD-9 codes with a positive predictive value of 94% and a sensitivity of 86%. We identified SLE cases in a de-identified EHR that contains over 2.8â€‰million subjects. Autoantibody status was defined as ever positive for dsDNA, RNP, Smith, SSA, and SSB. PheWAS was performed in dsDNA positive vs negative SLE patients using logistic regression adjusting for current age and race. For multiple testing, a false discovery rate (FDR) p of 0.05 was used. We also performed logistic regression to assess the impact of autoantibodies, age, sex, and race on SLE criteria. Results We identified 1097 SLE subjects. As expected, dsDNA positive subjects, compared to dsDNA negative, were more likely to have renal codes including nephritis (OR=4.60, FDR p=2.33 Ã— 10 -9 ), renal failure (OR=2.30, FDR p=1.85 Ã— 10 -5 ), and end stage renal disease (OR=2.63, FDR p=0.01). After adjusting for sex, race, age, and other autoantibodies, dsDNA was independently associated with nephritis (p=1.98 Ã— 10 -6 ) and chronic kidney disease (p=0.001) and also associated, along with SSB, with serositis (p=0.01) and hematologic criteria (p=0.001) (figure 1). dsDNA negative subjects were more likely to have codes for sleep, pain, and mood disorders. Conclusion Using PheWAS, we uncovered a hierarchy within SLE specific autoantibodies where dsDNA, compared to other autoantibodies, was a powerful predictor of major organ involvement in SLE.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""April Barnado"", ids = ""6339688""); list(name = ""Robert J.

df443efafb4953c97765b4f7bfe32bbf43c47db3,Genome-wide analysis of blood gene expression in migraine implicates immune-inflammatory pathways,"Background Typical migraine is a frequent, debilitating and painful headache disorder with an estimated heritability of about 50%. Although genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified over 40 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with migraine, further research is required to determine their biological role in migraine susceptibility. Therefore, we performed a study of genome-wide gene expression in a large sample of 83 migraine cases and 83 non-migraine controls to determine whether altered expression levels of genes and pathways could provide insights into the biological mechanisms underlying migraine. Methods We assessed whole blood gene expression data for 17994 expression probes measured using IlluminaHT-12 v4.0 BeadChips. Differential expression was assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Gene expression probes with a nominal p valueâ€‰<â€‰0.05 were classified as differentially expressed. We identified modules of co-regulated genes and tested them for enrichment of differentially expressed genes and functional pathways using a false discovery rate <0.05. Results Association analyses between migraine and probe expression levels, adjusted for age and gender, revealed an excess of small p values, but there was no significant single-probe association after correction for multiple testing. Network analysis of pooled expression data identified 10 modules of co-expressed genes. One module harboured a significant number of differentially expressed genes and was strongly enriched with immune-inflammatory pathways, including multiple pathways expressed in microglial cells. Conclusions These data suggest immune-inflammatory pathways play an important role in the pathogenesis, manifestation, and/or progression of migraine in some patients. Furthermore, gene-expression associations are measurable in whole blood, suggesting the analysis of blood gene expression can inform our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying migraine, identify biomarkers, and facilitate the discovery of novel pathways and thus determine new targets for drug therapy.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Zachary F.

f7e331afe6a4d19d760e39b6fcb16ad90bd48ad8,"Abstract 3636: Systems biology approach links genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic features to tamoxifen sensitivity.","Utilizing existing genome-wide genotype, transcriptome and microRNA (miRNA) datasets, we developed an integrative approach to evaluate the role of genetic-epigenetic regulatory networks in human complex traits. In this study, we focused on cellular sensitivity to tamoxifen, a commonly prescribed breast cancer medication as a phenotype of interest. A sequential multi-dimensional model was constructed to first identify genes/miRNAs whose expression levels are correlated with tamoxifen sensitivity. This in turn facilitated the identification of SNPs associated with potential functionally relevant genomic features. Finally, associations between these selected SNPs and cellular sensitivity to tamoxifen were evaluated. A permutation-based false discovery rate (FDR) procedure showed that association findings from our approach have much lower FDRs when compared to those obtained through a traditional single-step genome-wide association study (GWAS) between SNP and drug sensitivity. Our model identified 50 unique SNPs associated with 30 miRNAs and 34 gene expression levels, all of which associated with cellular sensitivity to tamoxifen phenotypes in HapMap YRI samples. Among them, several miRNAs and genes have been previously implicated to play a role in tamoxifen sensitivity; most are novel. Functional studies on select miRNAs/genes are currently underway in both the HapMap samples and breast cancer cell lines. Citation Format: Eric R.

e29120ac7501a0a9001c0a6dbf8a535205856a41,"Associations of adolescent emotional and loss of control eating with 1â€year changes in disordered eating, weight, and adiposity","OBJECTIVE
Adolescent emotional-eating, referring to eating in response to negative affective states, is frequently reported by those with loss of control (LOC) eating. Although LOC eating has been shown to predict exacerbated disordered eating and excess weight/adiposity gain, the extent to which emotional-eating, either alone or in combination with LOC, predicts adverse outcomes has not been determined. Thus, we examined associations of baseline emotional-eating with changes in disordered eating, BMI, and adiposity over 1-year, and to what degree the presence or absence of baseline LOC moderated these associations.


METHODS
189 non-treatment-seeking youth (15.4â€‰Â±â€‰1.4y; 66% female; 67% non-Hispanic White, 38% overweight [BMI â‰¥ 85th %ile]) completed the emotional-eating Scale for Children/Adolescents and the Eating Disorder Examination interview at baseline and again at 1-year. Air displacement plethysmography assessed adiposity at both time points.


RESULTS
Baseline emotional-eating alone was not significantly associated with the development of objective binge eating or changes in disordered eating attitudes, BMI or adiposity 1-year later. However, baseline emotional-eating interacted with the presence of baseline LOC in the prediction of 1-year outcomes. Among adolescents with LOC eating, greater baseline emotional-eating was related to increased disordered eating attitudes (pâ€‰=â€‰.03), BMI (pâ€‰=â€‰.04), and adiposity (pâ€‰=â€‰.04) at 1-year, after correcting for false discovery rate.


DISCUSSION
Emotional-eating among youth also reporting LOC was associated with adverse outcomes over 1-year. Adolescents who report both behaviors may represent a subset of individuals at especially high risk for exacerbated disordered eating and excess weight gain.

24b9bbf8a420f1013d7d08e49a17f6e116b8f06e,Accurate error control in high dimensional association testing using conditional false discovery rates,"High-dimensional hypothesis testing is ubiquitous in the biomedical sciences, and informative covariates may be employed to improve power. The conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) is widely-used approach suited to the setting where the covariate is a set of p-values for the equivalent hypotheses for a second trait. Although related to the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, it does not permit any easy control of type-1 error rate, and existing methods are over-conservative. We propose a new method for type-1 error rate control based on identifying mappings from the unit square to the unit interval defined by the estimated cFDR, and splitting observations so that each map is independent of the observations it is used to test. We also propose an adjustment to the existing cFDR estimator which further improves power. We show by simulation that the new method more than doubles potential improvement in power over unconditional analyses compared to existing methods. We demonstrate our method on transcriptome-wide association studies, and show that the method can be used in an iterative way, enabling the use of multiple covariates successively. Our methods substantially improve the power and applicability of cFDR analysis.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""James Liley"", ids = ""144042855""); list(name = ""Chris Wallace"", ids = ""46907018"")",6404294be6ba2862c1cc9ab737385f3a091f8503; e08087a18b4af48beefa39913c76e530f773720b,b34385fab890190a7937457061929718ef904b69; 16bd79e17676c9a0115d1a31b76ee223ccd39b25; b17a7cdf0db0d00ca8565bb6d58a756509b028cf; 5675d3cd21136002bce54e3a8153c415df22ac49; 1e18ad1d5a5311cfc801755fbf5a2c302116ffa1; bdfb57141b2141095ed942b28be24808aeba8d54; 8258f2b4577c68ee6a7d903384bfe6442e082b4b; 2eea7ba82f0b3d970093d28d1588f72d9563ea9b; 8c1eed72bb4c630e18c051b062dfab77e12eddb6; 22dcca0d190b6899e43622598fa6b3332137c1a1; 0526a79d4c1493f211baac1551714e5eb4e3c68c; 86377a795559a46e6cab2b28caaec152f9b76add; 87829eec780bdcab4f5f10d1d84c1feaf97aecfb; 958d61f5f7aa50e55d96128b28a7340f5d02d3d0; 5d263bd3c0585dca079840c633880f04b00abc48; 177f2ac22a44e3474b0649a29d3d2a2e841f7105; e5a18974a2b058575b0e7a0e08a1a076f8388be6; 4072bdaddc6fae3dd11e43dfc47d5f2e280c3c4d; 27877b4dace8aefa6d18037d83c8e74bab99fdd8; c1c230d99f3002ffcb5ca2d9682d8d820c5d76eb; 738f063d62eb02e41872679ea76e5c5a1553ff92; 5efd232ea926235af8631bb35ca71eeca32be114; 77f8aa61d1d32875fc37fcce3fe356cd20cd596e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c5361bb3d7096821b92c900ce3ce3559e4c5e61a; 721a5fd127edd33a83d06ffc9ed293f1486200ef; 2e5258900ba2f9134dcd5bee4a1f88091a972234; 8d2c4ff9b2d9299badff3b17740f744b8880b5b2; 02b9b415579468124b96142059a3939262c8cb53; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; 0d9332c95a81666116f8069f7adf92bab34316df; 91c71c82356b101042502e2f80efe6a454d7ff09; ab4d13bd1dd062427cc7a78f158fba60dd2b6daf; 1ee765d218aaea7ef4d95df27043954fb7d3b4df; 9c878593318d379b8d890abdb4550dd78bfa27e2; 497ec7a2845d625abc483bfde3ad362922187280; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 48b4032a0de32aedd89ade32e2e09f59e116e447; ca7326493c861768f419111d78ff083dd72f6a98; 357a29d507b392c022dc78c11d7353d75810ac55; 92f559d5affc881d07d5c24c631e7bbd2688210b; 72cc66c4823f15980b494d02b8d3943e2049f9ef; f4381036f94e98d96f95ee04f7c448439bc86e77; a5365b877640d05e1b770aa772c79ad62756538b; d9e2a43715b103e66d940cb52c98248bbe7d7afb; 1cd72e80c066723148f5fc6d8be5eeacc60f0960,bioRxiv,,
6799109a1fe8cb1ea77a974072d43527fc759cf3,An empirical Bayes mixture model for SNP detection in pooled sequencing data,"MOTIVATION
Detecting single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in pooled sequencing data is more challenging than in individual sequencing because of sampling variations across pools. To effectively differentiate SNP signal from sequencing error, appropriate estimation of the sequencing error is necessary. In this article, we propose an empirical Bayes mixture (EBM) model for SNP detection and allele frequency estimation in pooled sequencing data.


RESULTS
The proposed model reliably learns the error distribution by pooling information across pools and genomic positions. In addition, the proposed EBM model builds in characteristics unique to the pooled sequencing data, boosting the sensitivity of SNP detection. For large-scale inference in SNP detection, the EBM model provides a flexible and robust way for estimation and control of local false discovery rate. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method through simulation studies and real data application.

Bulk and shear moduli, Lame parameter Î», Vp/Vs, and Poissonâ€™s ratio are among parameters subjected to comparative analysis as potential gas indicators. Rock density Ï, product Ï * Î» and ratio of Lame Parameter Î» to shear modulus were also tested as potential gas indicators. Additionally, two one-dimensional aggregated parameters constructed as combinations of several parameters and multidimensional parameters were tested using machine learning techniques and ROC curve analysis.. Ranking parameters and evaluation of their efficiency was based on two methods: (1) Dissimilarity-based method independent of classification technique and (2) ROC curve analysis specific to individual classification methodology. Both types of methods work in terms of true and false discovery rates. The parameter built as a combination of five other parameters (Lame parameter Î», Vp to Vs ratio, velocities of compressional and shear waves, and rock density) get high rankings using both methods. This parameter demonstrates a higher true discovery rate and a limited false discovery rate in identification of gas-sands versus brine-sand or shale. The parameters Poissonâ€™s ratio, Vp/Vs, bulk over shear modulus, Lame parameter Î» over shear modulus also rank highly. Cross validation was used to control over classification with undue increase of estimate of true discovery rate.

Comparative genomics has been used to identify likely targets of some of these transcription factors, but these predictions typically lack experimental support. Here, we used mutant fitness data, which measures the importance of each gene for a bacterium's growth across many conditions, to test regulatory predictions from RegPrecise, a curated collection of comparative genomics predictions. Because characterized transcription factors often have correlated fitness with one of their targets (either positively or negatively), correlated fitness patterns provide support for the comparative genomics predictions. At a false discovery rate of 3%, we identified significant cofitness for at least one target of 158 TFs in 107 ortholog groups and from 24 bacteria. Thus, high-throughput genetics can be used to identify a high-confidence subset of the sequence-based regulatory predictions.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shiori Sagawa"", ids = ""2389237""); list(name = ""Morgan N.

3252b0e2cbb7bf2d0675c64dd022dd3b03f60774,Computational models reveal genotype-phenotype associations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Genome sequencing is essential to understand individual variation and to study the mechanisms that explain relations between genotype and phenotype. The accumulated knowledge from large-scale genome sequencing projects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates is being used to study the mechanisms that explain such relations. Our objective was to undertake genetic characterization of 172 S. cerevisiae strains from different geographical origins and technological groups, using 11 polymorphic microsatellites, and computationally relate these data with the results of 30 phenotypic tests. Genetic characterization revealed 280 alleles, with the microsatellite ScAAT1 contributing most to intrastrain variability, together with alleles 20, 9 and 16 from the microsatellites ScAAT4, ScAAT5 and ScAAT6. These microsatellite allelic profiles are characteristic for both the phenotype and origin of yeast strains. We confirm the strength of these associations by construction and cross-validation of computational models that can predict the technological application and origin of a strain from the microsatellite allelic profile. Associations between microsatellites and specific phenotypes were scored using information gain ratios, and significant findings were confirmed by permutation tests and estimation of false discovery rates. The phenotypes associated with higher number of alleles were the capacity to resist to sulphur dioxide (tested by the capacity to grow in the presence of potassium bisulphite) and the presence of galactosidase activity. Our study demonstrates the utility of computational modelling to estimate a strain technological group and phenotype from microsatellite allelic combinations as tools for preliminary yeast strain selection.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ricardo Franco-Duarte"", ids = ""1398340361""); list(name = ""Ines Sequeira Mendes"", ids = ""122203566""); list(name = ""Lan Umek"", ids = ""2256143""); list(name = ""JoÃ£o Drumonde-Neves"", ids = ""1400912660""); list(name = ""Blaz Zupan"", ids = ""1775384""); list(name = ""Dorit Elisabeth Schuller"", ids = ""143783302"")",d8259978169bf43c9744510c0f2e4ebeffac5b77; 228a52ad15002496d732305fc6e6943e694f8c41; d028b74f56ca4615d56f048a1bf7bba6b9234d36; 40415fe226d2b754625a8a95b3861ff38f117e79; 491ed1aa1a75d4af7d3b241b8d0e66baec1ae184; 4ea6b09ac061828974f9ab920513ddde12b564dd; c832fd3faab4a8784ff73e2f16ea9db5dec37624,12ff26b58b3e3b3e86676b004e4c72828dc2d642; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a52429c85b8f923d08a9118ddb752bb148be4569; 735719c4b7003e9de9bcf4974224568dfae6f869; 4fee154834b88dd65cd60705e69c6a4e7d2a8092; 6e4cc84a8f5ed1df2479c27252bc3e5e9e70c53f; bc37489e7173c75be152b2fcea35191c68847ab2; 0503c33fb5ad2a4289292bc08119f52183d9798f; 4fd1d1c52499c6de66bd13c53b8512b16eca9459; 3ff6ab04e9ba9fb47f25867937c0108dcde20767; ee6fc95dcfadbcfbb1e5b9aea18dda34da46b92e; 4e4eaf02f8e8206925e96d9346cb6ad5339ae226; 0dbef4d43058e1aeddfe5b4553180643acfd74a0; e60a8858a71297313deb968a18dc606fb7afa21c; ac0a0d52d5fbec7b5b15b8777b4a264b86a2f039; 90e60e60b26fcc777677d03cda0fb079000d3990; 4ce64682c82a92b547d82a31e4f5f3f27f7e35dc; d8f93745815f81d13200325a1e1b000a4b32a6eb; d582de02199d85789d34f304fafa990eb96a3049; 5741e8851fc2ebf54f16ff9f06397bdca05a5070; 61ef2b16820c525fe7c12d68dd4afe56247ac245; 97fa7f49e8082521515b4ce3a20d3f04fc1a3a03; f6b5d0ef7b1d37bd8fd8e83f1819bd04609f22a3; 31c70577204b741bfedc469be1b82f50daabb35e; f4156a05a47fdeda30638e10954d3674cc056ab6; 47308595abf69d27cd473ba2ea373da0b7d8ae4d; a685e42e7c2b7ed42d2a6f82cf518bc358f138ac; aa68bd44a59480f7f0a67bf9787f14b87cd11ca7; a4bc2bcda976aeb7b11cdc9557ad6049f2e43f4d; c20f242aa329f0efe5e8ab6e563a8bbbc31e3dbf; a2f9440063e7769282312dcacee22e64feffa82c; dfd4722b855e425ec82bed5c64533a1b8c19317d; 382a0a44dc3fc30b6a5715712726302124033aeb; 8dacd68feaa9c678cf7ef18b35f8815aaf93e54e; 744fca788917d09f17f94fd406e1bb0b0b61b707; db66974053004f9ea6c3d6ac2570c37525d96d36; 2b7ab1b6299d04450ec50e6e72d1793d09ac2311; a31bac6df161bbf4cc1243ad4b62e9d7bd4255be; 2b065157bb18ad6feae196fa86e815901c123695; 85fc65353eef0e0000ceff5385b52a37f48af8c3; ada07414ab935224db200004eaf53f520f1743e5; 91abdf7f160b9cbe23204040c628ff17f5514060; 9db23f177fab12e8c553e973e2e5af0a9e9d7833; 1b380f26af0cc7ee23d421da07e3712a47a512dc; bcee7c85d237b79491a773ef51e746bbbcf48e35; bb144c04b9eb44579b19d21c3d5954401408440b; 527b469dd3b6e6c00b7a3a0b242f91b3b63b4f9b; 16a2c4960e2f00df2ad05d43b2e0e146ee7ca5a4; ebcd1f2f285075ceb6bafbef2b287a386c31fd06; b308622ff4effddb0745dd8d6f52a20681d5f13e; 1570a41006eb4fbae8ed2e755ac844c55b187354; d737ebd3607c1cdac787e44e563b0d6a34598188,Yeast,31 7,"

dc7afb5e8b3e4bc676a99ba3a2d660f176146514,"Effects of CYP4F2 polymorphism on response to warfarin during induction phase: a prospective, open-label, observational cohort study.","BACKGROUND
The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4F2 isozyme has been reported to metabolize vitamin K(1) in vitro, and the V433M polymorphism in the CYP4F2 gene has been associated with reduced vitamin K(1) metabolism and the need for a higher maintenance dosage in patients receiving warfarin.


OBJECTIVE
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of V433M polymorphism on warfarin response during the induction phase.


METHODS
Warfarin-naive white patients in whom warfarin was scheduled to be initiated with a target INR of 2 to 3 were enrolled into the study. On enrollment, a single blood sample for the genotyping of CYP4F2, CYP2C9, and VKORC1 was drawn. The international normalized ratio (INR) was followed daily during induction and twice weekly until stable anticoagulation was reached. The relationships between several markers of warfarin response during induction and CYP4F2 polymorphism were determined.


RESULTS
The cohort consisted of 241 patients (115 men; mean [SD] age, 55.2 [19.4] years; weight, 79.5 [18.3] kg). Most of the patients were carriers of the CYP4F2 CC genotype (112 patients) or the CT genotype (104 patients). In carriers of the TT genotype (25 patients), INR >3 was >4-fold lower compared with that in carriers of the CC or CT genotype, suggesting that patients with the TT genotype were less sensitive to warfarin during induction. Also in TT carriers, the extent of excessive anticoagulation was >10-fold lower than in the other carriers. Both of these findings had a nominal P value of <0.05. After adjustment for false discovery rate, none of the findings remained significant at a threshold q value of <0.05. Among CC carriers, the concurrent use of a statin was associated with a 1-mg/d reduction in warfarin maintenance dosage. No similar effect was noted in the CT or TT carriers, suggesting a possible genetic influence on warfarin-statin interaction.


CONCLUSIONS
These preliminary findings suggest that among white patients treated with warfarin, CYP4F2 polymorphism had a measurable effect on warfarin responsiveness during induction; however, the observed differences failed to reach the level of statistical significance. The possibility that the effect of statins on warfarin anticoagulation varies among carriers of different CYP4F2 genotypes could not be excluded and should be evaluated further in a larger patient sample.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Idit Bejarano-Achache"", ids = ""1403214572""); list(name = ""Liran Levy"", ids = ""144576342""); list(name = ""Liat Mlynarsky"", ids = ""5792021""); list(name = ""Meir Bialer"", ids = ""79363507""); list(name = ""Mordechai Muszkat"", ids = ""3519985""); list(name = ""Yoseph Caraco"", ids = ""5040718"")",a9172f47cdf67127ebd1fc0dd4ee5944bf75a048; cb71d099a90c65297a425694337d561b9f50148c; 5331512ea6c8e419657a0c9445efcb7c418a05ce; fb75f00c232d44b1eb605a5784a4b090e1540588; cbad44e86833e530128a92c270ba8bf96cb37fa4; 92fae0a98feb18d696ead9fdd63bfdd721c3de16; 259fb5b494183f178b769f1c89253d26e9ffff67; b552dd83e2e424b1bffc46c13378a049938b84ae; d4b5742802556a4ef4e492fcb90f4bfaaf8f910e; 6be957a56ffcdf742e7cb825764e09d970963d79; ba9cc482025ce0f392fc1cc046bc8a3bb1ef5bbb; 844aea5966fe0b03dec8343a0daacb32544fd719; f44281e3794bf85f5d99bb107aeaeab1fe66729d; 47c061a34e02eba982de10f9ae6709deebca2d3c; 3224526c6c6db93f19d2b7dc34d863bce4b348b2; 0fa274e6a72325e96f2a05e82d53b3b36f40289b,9dbb708c1f77faf4c5520642c744cfa9de04a1bd; 528da2f4d2730d89e36eb4d1886f1c20faba1355; 4ac01842188408c5733b37501c4031ee56daa881; 03178483fd8981e43e35bd344633f18998e4eb74; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; 6e6d7ee46c7bb08599d8b2e7c202232342c76483; 9c64ea08b41275e243618e9c6d13694da6ce3a44; 1065086e220161d7939e1612d43d4df2fabd42f4; 820aa61ae497d271afc9fd33e8509679a0017b16; 08a5dd508ca40884c69d3aa5faa986d65c12396a; db7bd80e793132e18d3191be0cd2c43d44cb2b2d; 830e70ea3199bda018936763d59bbb8560cf365f; 4ede10a62ab0e6f4d3cadb42edad9adc8422441c; 82fd3dd992a17348f462485adcfdf46931e186be; c56fc2af880d13a7b75fd29bd48fa3cbe95f0d94; a66e7c8217e3b858c0aefc9d4c9fa8ed5d66314d; 323908da3dcf2a25392b503154f4180f31500bfe; b027e2064b2aad4688230e4dbf9148c5e9ebe1c5; 7e89acf0b47604693f7df5908d573718363b64f9; 9ddd4976a347c79b71b8c666f1d89a8694a8ba78; 5bb6b4b1d11f07b8be9592839ee24a0523a9b5c5; e6b9ece330351e3843abce3cbbe83456e608f6ba; a370589c2ca168764aeff2e52dc4d491c188dae3; 2295842c35ececf6df07a713a03c4c8b7abefad6; df9f164d64d635146279e8ef4dcdeb7132da3a34; 4bd06fb96e54f895e4e68ba02aeec3f025bc9486; c80ef4c9b85d4e8fafb3a20f869403603cd7c711; f390eb32910f09a55f225242f61f2e4218ab05c6; 8d01677b1a0b6f7b3fe8210419d0cd712afbf614; 5dcc0d6273d3a9ab3b1bb6ca20244b8128e1335a; 924a5f7542e81a72e3251612d88820f1f53c29ac; 17cdcb371b3f79eb439199b5598cf611fe522b77; 49e4f041412de3fde707fcd70bd2f009740afeba; 8d3e0a7f1aea840c0a3bde76d1ea2f9928709a7d; de30f0c5f8b4966bdd13b1276694639c4a2a234f; 30c8e76c268a33ecdc09726c17e410b192a32210; 3fdf478cbacfc5ad461eb76e38ae573c7f77169e; 756cfa666b44c53fe249eb40763bd71a9501c31f; 24a445e96eb16114770c1bfa08bdb6e498737a40; 9b962d8c0e84b26638af2e2000fd400675df0185; 395434a5d392659399ed6fafef87b18035a72f46,Clinical therapeutics,34 4,"

04b59be018bad59d0c2a7cbb62538ee93c38d052,Sampling strategy optimization to increase statistical power in landscape genomics: A simulationâ€based approach,"An increasing number of studies are using landscape genomics to investigate local adaptation in wild and domestic populations. The implementation of this approach requires the sampling phase to consider the complexity of environmental settings and the burden of logistic constraints. These important aspects are often underestimated in the literature dedicated to sampling strategies. In this study, we computed simulated genomic datasets to run against actual environmental data in order to trial landscape genomics experiments under distinct sampling strategies. These strategies differed by design approach (to enhance environmental and/or geographic representativeness at study sites), number of sampling locations and sample sizes. We then evaluated how these elements affected statistical performances (power and false discoveries) under two antithetical demographic scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate sample size, which should be modified based on the demographic characteristics of the studied population. For species with limited dispersal, sample sizes above 200 units are generally sufficient to detect most adaptive signals, while in random mating populations this threshold should be increased to 400 units. Furthermore, we describe a design approach that maximizes both environmental and geographical representativeness of sampling sites and show how it systematically outperforms random or regular sampling schemes. Finally, we show that although having more sampling locations (between 40 and 50 sites) increase statistical power and reduce false discovery rate, similar results can be achieved with a moderate number of sites (20 sites).

Suter, Cristian Coarfa, Krithika Lingappan, Dimuthu Perera, Bhagavatula Moorthy, Kjersti M. Aagaard Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, Texas Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Houston, TX OBJECTIVE: Studies reveal that prenatal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth. PAHs are generated through incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and are also found in tobacco smoke. In this study we utilized mass spectrometry and RNA-Seq in the placenta to measure alterations of the placental transcriptome with PAH exposures. STUDY DESIGN: PAHs were extracted from placenta (n1â„427) and analyzed via gas chromatography and mass spec (Agilent 7890A and 5975C). Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and Benzo[b] fluoranthene (BbF) quantification was performed using universal standards. RNA was extracted from the same samples, and utilized for RNA-Seq. DNA sequencing libraries were generated from the cDNA and cluster generation and sequencing was performed on the Illumina cBot station and Illumina Hiseq 2000. Sequenced reads were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh38) with HISAT2 and assigned to genomic features with StringTie. Samples were stratified into high and low exposure groups based on mass spec results. Differential expression was determined using a parametric test and the R statistical system, and genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing corrected value < 0.05 were considered deferentially expressed. Gene set enrichment and ontology analysis was performed with GSEA. RESULTS: Levels of placental BaP and BbF were highly correlated (Pearsons r1â„40.954, p<0.001). Expression levels of 500 genes (p<0.05) were significantly changed (figure); 168 genes were upregulated, and 322 down regulated in the high exposure group compared with low exposure. Analysis of 1630 networks in GSEA revealed alterations in immune and inflammatory responses with PAH exposure (-4.17223 and -3.3718 respectively). Of interest, response to prostaglandins was significantly altered (-1.9667). CONCLUSION: We found significant correlations between PAHs in the placenta, which validates the technique as reports have shown that we are exposed to mixtures of PAHs through ambient air. The finding that the placental transcriptome is altered with PAH exposures requires further investigation in order to uncover mechanisms behind the adverse effects of PAH exposure in utero. PAH exposure has been associated with preterm birth, and follow up of these altered networks, including response to prostaglandins will help to further our understanding of these adverse effects.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Melissa A.

Then, we apply a statistical procedure to control the false discovery rate.

52914506a43cf5df8fef1cc2d3c292082d17d8ad,Case-control study of the relationship of depressive symptoms to suicide in a community-based sample of individuals with schizophrenia in China,"BACKGROUND
Suicide is the leading cause of premature death among people with schizophrenia. Most studies on suicide and schizophrenia report an associated depression history, but they are based on clinical samples from mostly western countries.


METHODS
We conducted a secondary analysis of 74 suicides (cases) and 24 accidental deaths (controls) among persons with schizophrenia identified in a national psychological autopsy study in mainland China using the Chinese version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. A 'depression symptom severity score' based on number, severity, and persistence of depressive symptoms 2 weeks before death was derived from psychiatric interviews with 2 informants; determination of a 'dysfunction due to depressive symptoms score' was based on informants' reports about effects of depressive symptoms on decedents' functioning in the month before death. In addition, the mean number of negative life events was determined along with the effect of the events on the decedent. Comparison of the measures made for cases and controls were made by univariate analysis followed by adjustments using the False Discovery Rate.


RESULTS
Compared to persons with schizophrenia who died by accident, those who died by suicide were more likely to have a recent DSM IV diagnosis of major depression, the symptom of depressed mood, thoughts of death and a prior suicide attempt. In addition, those who died by suicide were more likely to have a higher overall depression severity score and greater dysfunction due to depressive symptoms.


DISCUSSION
This community-based study of individuals with DSM-IV schizophrenia who died by suicide in a non-western culture extends findings from clinical studies in western cultures providing data on the importance of depressive symptoms as risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia in a low income rural setting. These findings underline the importance of routine screening for depressive symptoms among patients with schizophrenia.",2010,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""John W.

In replicate trials we used a simple 192 probe nonamer array to construct a fingerprint library of 25 closely related Salmonella isolates. Controlling false discovery rate for multiple testing at alpha = 0.05, at least 295 of 300 pairs of S.enterica isolate fingerprints were found to be statistically distinct using a modified Hotelling T2 test.

278578c97d40bceeb5bb56d51483e257d6b1549e,Gender-specific association of TSNAX/DISC1 locus for schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder in South Indian population,"Genetic association studies have implicated the TSNAX/DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1) in schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) and major depression. This study was performed to assess the possible involvement of TSNAX/DISC1 locus in the aetiology of BPAD and SCZ in the Southern Indian population. We genotyped seven single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) from TSNAX/DISC1 region in 1252 individuals (419 BPAD patients, 408 SCZ patients and 425 controls). Binary logistic regression revealed a nominal association for rs821616 in DISC1 for BPAD and also combined cases of BPAD or SCZ, but after correcting for multiple testing, these results were non-significant. However, significant association was observed with BPAD, as well as combined cases of BPAD or SCZ, within the female subjects for the rs766288 after applying false discovery rate corrections at the 0.05 level. Two-locus analysis showed Câ€“C (rs766288â€“rs2812393) as a risk combination in BPAD, and Gâ€“T (rs2812393â€“rs821616) as a protective combination in SCZ and combined cases of BPAD or SCZ. Female-specific associations were observed for rs766288â€“rs2812393, rs766288â€“rs821616 and rs8212393â€“rs821616 in two-locus analysis.

The present report concerns analysis of multiple independent biological replicates of control and 24 h infected lysates of A549 cells by two different proteomic workflows. One workflow involved fractionation of lysates by in-solution protein IEF and individual fractions were digested using trypsin prior to capillary HPLC-LTQ-OrbitrapXL-MS/MS. A second workflow involved digestion of whole cell lysates and analysis by nanoUltraHPLC-LTQ-OrbitrapElite-MS/MS. Both workflows resulted in the quantification of viral proteins exclusively in lysates of infected cells in the relative abundances anticipated from previous studies. Unprecedented numbers (3247 - 5010) of host cell protein groups were also quantified and the infection-specific regulation of a large number (191) of these protein groups was evident based on a stringent false discovery rate cut-off (<1%). Bioinformatic analyses revealed that most of the regulated proteins were potentially regulated by type I, II, and III interferon, TNF-Î± and noncanonical NF-ÎºB2 mediated antiviral response pathways. Regulation of specific protein groups by infection was validated by quantitative Western blotting and the cytokine-/key regulator-specific nature of their regulation was confirmed by comparable analyses of cytokine treated A549 cells. Overall, it is evident that the workflows described herein have produced the most comprehensive proteomic characterization of host cell responses to human respiratory syncytial virus published to date. These workflows will form the basis for analysis of the impacts of specific genes of human respiratory syncytial virus responses of A549 and other cell lines using a gene-deleted version of the virus. They should also prove valuable for the analysis of the impact of other infectious agents on host cells.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Keyur A.

8032fcfbff6bf822ec2f1dd237fe8eb0eb64c835,Connectometry evaluation in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy: an exploratory study,"This research investigated local brain connectivity changes following Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA) by connectometry. Seventeen subjects (15 males and 2 females, mean age 74.1Â years), all eligible for CEA, were prospectively recruited in this exploratory study. On the same day within the week before the CEA, each patient underwent a cognitive evaluation with a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exam that included a DTI sequence for the connectometry analysis. A second MMSE and the same MRI protocol were performed on follow-up, 3â€“6Â months after CEA. The MMSE scores were analyzed using T-Student tests. The connectometry analysis was performed using a multiple regression model to consider the effect of CEA, choosing three different T-score threshold (T-threshold) values (1, 2 and 3). Results were considered statistically valid for p value adjusted for False Discovery Rate (p-FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05. Comparison of pre-CEA and post-CEA MMSE scores showed improvement of MMSE scores after CEA. Connectometry analysis revealed no areas of statistically significant increased connectivity related to CEA for T-threshold valueâ€‰=â€‰1 and 2, but showed statistically significant increase of connectivity after CEA in both cerebellar hemispheres and corpus callosum for T-threshold valueâ€‰=â€‰3 (p-FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.0106667). The network property analysis showed improved small worldness (2.14%), clustering coefficient (1.64%), local (1.94%) and global efficiency (0.56%), and reduced characteristic path length (âˆ’0.52%) after CEA. These results suggest that CEA is associated both with cognitive performance improvement and changes in interhemispheric local connectivity in the corpus callosum and cerebellum.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michele Porcu"", ids = ""18259164""); list(name = ""Davide Craboledda"", ids = ""6933469""); list(name = ""Paolo Garofalo"", ids = ""3019535""); list(name = ""Giulio Columbano"", ids = ""51209521""); list(name = ""Luigi Barberini"", ids = ""2017558""); list(name = ""Roberto Sanfilippo"", ids = ""31975812""); list(name = ""Fulvio Zaccagna"", ids = ""6293190""); list(name = ""Max Wintermark"", ids = ""1794900""); list(name = ""R Montisci"", ids = ""3884143""); list(name = ""Luca Saba"", ids = ""144140606"")",,14f0c50d24e8cad3bb0e8736a48e06c814cb66ce; eeff3f73b93a3c831f054ad9f78235d19035d237; a8a0c7f3b092a0e51009c755bc19187519e0129d; ca030acb4a23806dc10a8202cd6a49cc6fed5998; 353c6cce7cc0cbd1330371c8ddb32040881ea1a4; 19e894a39aad21ba4e827abae2d1c87c14423866; 20c6761c0b806d8b989168a4b6576c7f31954fca; 6e07f5aff270ea6be291058139a745f6a795c38e; eb0d0aa94e80a260ec7389042a849e46fbb2860e; 434372b81ffa0079e66838b4ff8cc2318e08b9a5; e6fa14249d36af877d894098641dfa0186bd6cc3; a0e6827f0f774362da3ed55ef47d5045f5112a27; c9dea523c43912e0d42a7aca1ce2a7afe3ad705a; af307c754f41e1d0f5e61b6c7fade3f68137ec34; 791c9179e81ba225171bd41df4fe0910e26f0f3e; a9bb6b70065d3a5c31012887134b357db0c2c314; cf1d949e5197753c304e2e57ef83d51543eb176f; 96c3dc8b94392568b438175fbf34de5f8997afcb; 63d77a838386f881b17ce6cdf6b3b902ca865d9e; 4f029caf4166de854fb50505a63015e143a89262; 8016b8c93c413dd985852f795758bb5643f83867; b39c52e750668715cd77a3436f1e04e33332d182; 33a168e8c94861291d28880a1910339d7dcb8db9; f4f2c22109a079221fcae0fe3ef54f7535cb3a62; f344ff64a42f64841632f40a8d4ceb9cb32b8ce5; 721efbf6f4d640028317946e6c64ff7510b70387; 67f30bec81b5af78c9299e88a21b18cc4226e574; 4e236c1ea2658113be3c995e329358e5b7db3be5; 4bfbcbd123e593065f74efd63ed1c20925f8fa65; 75a0ae6195a7ade2f0094d55bdab1d34c362635e; 381886ae27ff64e46d7cd783ea8c04eb23e510d4; 8845c68a0e49093604e2de5e870f88d1c2aeda10; 2b5a2fbd66585d80ce72c823466a4163d0b424a1; ce1e9e37a19eab826deefbfef7b604f1f43de4f2; 8222a11f04a48e3c0036f9f5f278a21b54d71a64; a3cac49538aa7f49e085b6ff76be1ff9e0863f61; 0db03c1c9b3fd3ec7fb77e211503e5ef33953a60; 8c882899a6a755bdf07800751e673849f3ec5b46; 2c7d798d1a2af7a6df800dbfed573a2a3e4b4f70; 6888dae049122711b018f40410dc0e130d9bee42; 4300b99fb43f66375346956398abc6645b71c4a1; 00a5990f909feacecd4f97c36f62fc5a9a60a58d; e7b85db89d5f2311b2e53dcac457cd8d27d20a83; aa30e8c1e8b1d8d5eeafb64fca929a49ee935650; bbd128ef74a337355e9c20541f35089d70bea456; 24c73e10056896fd6067f512dca5ac9645d6c4b2; c7d898c7b8a95286943aceacd1834ddc8609667f; a0c21a1768be958184694d9770534f85df101f64; b18b70d3777eb865c767eda6f812d9d6321de999; 52772052f6c141964774ee69f7897b943614185b,Brain Imaging and Behavior,,1-11
c6779f82a824a6218b07eee99fcc9d25ee2b3647,Association of patella alta with worsening of patellofemoral osteoarthritis-related structural damage: data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative.,"OBJECTIVES
To determine the association between Insall-Salvati ratio (ISR), a measure of patella alta, and worsening of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based osteoarthritis (OA)-related patellofemoral joint structural damages over 24-month in participants of the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI).


DESIGN
Using weighted random sampling method, we selected a sample of 500 knees (from 1,677 knees with available baseline and 24-months MRI OA Knee Score (MOAKS) measurements), which is OAI-representative regarding knee OA-related factors (i.e., baseline age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and radiographic Kellgren-Lawrence grading). The ISR was measured in all enrolled knees using baseline sagittal 3T-MRI plane by three radiologists. Baseline and 24-month MOAKS variables for patellofemoral bone marrow lesions (BMLs), cartilage damages, and osteophytes were extracted, and the associations between ISR and 24-month worsening of these 3T-MRI features were evaluated using multivariable regression models. After computing receiver operating characteristic curves, the optimal cutoff point of ISR for indicating worsening of patellofemoral OA was determined. P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons and false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P-values were reported.


RESULTS
In this longitudinal analysis, 24-month worsening of BML (odds ratio [OR] (95% confidence interval [95% CI]):11.18 (3.35-39.6), adjusted-p-value:<0.001) and cartilage scores (OR:7.39 (1.62-34.71), adjusted-p-value:0.042) in lateral patella was associated with higher baseline ISR. However, higher ISR was not statistically associated with medial patellar or medial and lateral trochlear BML or cartilage scores worsening. We determined the optimal cutoff point of ISRâ‰¥1.14 (95% CI: 1.083-1.284) for predicting lateral patellofemoral OA-related structural damages worsening over 24-months (sensitivity:73.73%; specificity: 66.67%).


CONCLUSIONS
Given the uncertainly surrounding the results, our overall findings suggest that ISR could be considered as a predictor of lateral patellofemoral OA-related structural damages worsening with the optimal cutoff point of â‰¥1.14 using knee sagittal MRI measurements.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Arya Haj-Mirzaian"", ids = ""1390023066""); list(name = ""Ali Guermazi"", ids = ""4399109""); list(name = ""Farhad Pishgar"", ids = ""5779164""); list(name = ""Ali Pourvaziri"", ids = ""11339059""); list(name = ""Frank W.

ProteinGoggle 2.0, as implemented with the isotopic mass-to-charge ratio and envelope fingerprinting algorithm, has multiple unique strengths for top-down characterization of histone PTMs together with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Here we report our database search and proteoform identification of HeLa core histone H4 using ProteinGoggle 2.0. The Theoretical database containing all putative proteoforms was created with shotgun annotation from the human H4 flat text downloaded from UniProt; information including the amino acid sequence, putative PTMs (methylation, di-methylation, tri-methylation, acetylation and phosphorylation) and amino acid variation (A77 to P) was adopted from the flat text file. A total of 426 proteoforms were confidently identified with a spectrum level false discovery rate of less than 1%, which represents the most comprehensive H4 proteoforms reported so far. Side-by-side comparison of these proteoforms with those identified by ProSightPC 2.0 was also made. By and large, ProteinGoggle 2.0 can be adopted for database search and proteoform identification of proteins with multiple combinatorial PTMs as well as amino acid variation.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Kaijie Xiao"", ids = ""3134673""); list(name = ""Zhixin Tian"", ids = ""2678586"")",e26a324c32b099f5e32a041582d9eca98d471c23; 22749de44c1fb4ef3d4e683ee47019da92fff195; 8565434ffd3f158e8e921f978140f0d5dd8a362c,,Chinese Journal of Chromatography,34,1255

However, in a significant proportion of patients the disease will relapse irrespective of the treatment modality (SERM, SERD, AI). Despite the progress made with multigene signatures for molecular classification of luminal breast cancers, predicting sensitivity towards endocrine modalities remains challenging. With the help of invasive ductal luminal breast cancers (IDLBC) from the METABRIC study we have developed an integrated clinical-pathologic and genomic classification method, identifying three distinct groups (IDLBC1, -2 and -3) [1, 2]. The 3 groups differ by DNA damage load, predominant lesion type, characteristic lesion patterns and oncogenic driver mechanisms [1, 3]. Here we present characteristic gene expression profiles of IDLBCs and discuss their biologic and clinical implications. Methods Gene expression profiles based on cDNA microarray data of 1.104 IDLBCs on the METABRIC study were examined (EGAS00000000083) [3]. To identify differentially expressed genes across IDLBC1-3 groups (52%, 23%, 25%), we compiled a gene list (N=2034) from 34 gene signatures reported to be predictive of ER, PR, GATA3, FOXA1 and/or AR signalling. A multiclass significance analysis of microarrays with 100 iterations and a false discovery rate of 0.05 was used to extract differentially expressed genes. Results Of 2034 steroid receptor signalling associated genes 36 exhibited differential expression in the IDLBC1/2 and -3 groups. The IDLBC1/2 specific set included 2 ER-associated genes (WLS, SPARCL1), 1 FOXA1-associated gene (NTN4) and 2 PR-associated genes (ZBTB16, CRY2). The IDLBC3 overexpressed set included 31 genes, amongst them regulators of mitotic fidelity, as well as effectors of centromere and kinetochore functioning. Eight of these genes have been reported as ER-associated (POLR2H, ECE2, SCL7A5, KIF11, FAM83D, GPSM2, MASTL, POLE2). Additional IDLBC3 hallmarks included high proliferation activity, defect apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal-transformation (EMT), BRCA-ness, multiple-drug resistance (MDR) and early relapse. The estimated relapse-free-survival rate at 5 years in the IDLBC3 group was 77% [95%CI 72; 82], significantly lower than in IDLBC1/2 tumours (91% [95%CI 89; 93]) and comparable to triple negative IDLBCs on the METABRIC study (70% [95%CI: 65; 76]). Conclusions We have shown that our integrated classification method has the potential to segregate early relapsing luminal breast cancers (IDLBC3) from tumours with favourable prognosis (IDLBC1/2). The data presented here and in the abstract by Demanse et al [4] provide also an intuitive hypothesis why IDLBC3 tumours are sensitive towards Letrozole but not Tamoxifen. Prospective clinical studies will be required to validate this hypothesis and to demonstrate the value of the IDLBC classification approach. References 1. Demanse, manuscript in preparation (2018) 2.

Prognostic models rely on demographic and clinical characteristics and are not reproducible. Integrating data from genomic analyses may identify novel prognostic models and provide mechanistic insights into IPF.MethodsTotal RNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was subjected to microarray profiling in a training (45 IPF individuals) and two independent validation cohorts (21 IPF/10 controls, and 75 IPF individuals, respectively). To identify a gene set predictive of IPF prognosis, we incorporated genomic, clinical, and outcome data from the training cohort. Predictor genes were selected if all the following criteria were met: 1) Present in a gene co-expression module from Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) that correlated with pulmonary function (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05); 2) Differentially expressed between observed â€œgoodâ€ vs. â€œpoorâ€ prognosis with fold change (FC) >1.5 and false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰2Â %; and 3) Predictive of mortality (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in univariate Cox regression analysis. â€œSurvival risk group predictionâ€ was adopted to construct a functional genomic model that used the IPF prognostic predictor gene set to derive a prognostic index (PI) for each patient into either high or low risk for survival outcomes. Prediction accuracy was assessed with a repeated 10-fold cross-validation algorithm and independently assessed in two validation cohorts through multivariate Cox regression survival analysis.ResultsA set of 118 IPF prognostic predictor genes was used to derive the functional genomic model and PI. In the training cohort, high-risk IPF patients predicted by PI had significantly shorter survival compared to those labeled as low-risk patients (log rank pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The prediction accuracy was further validated in two independent cohorts (log rank pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 and 0.002). Functional pathway analysis revealed that the canonical pathways enriched with the IPF prognostic predictor gene set were involved in T-cell biology, including iCOS, T-cell receptor, and CD28 signaling.ConclusionsUsing supervised and unsupervised analyses, we identified a set of IPF prognostic predictor genes and derived a functional genomic model that predicted high and low-risk IPF patients with high accuracy. This genomic model may complement current prognostic tools to deliver more personalized care for IPF patients.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yong Huang"", ids = ""40381175""); list(name = ""Shwu-Fan Ma"", ids = ""80984587""); list(name = ""Rekha Vij"", ids = ""40583865""); list(name = ""Justin M Oldham"", ids = ""5097135""); list(name = ""Jose David Herazo-Maya"", ids = ""1396397454""); list(name = ""Steven M.

c9b706c00a9f794888dd1adaef908287301df6b0,Drafts of the human proteome,"volume 32 number 8 august 2014 nature biotechnology Robert T. Lawrence and Judit VillÃ©n are at the Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA. e-mail: jvillen@u.washington.edu Kim et al.3 and Wilhelm et al.4 devoted considerable effort to developing potential applications of their datasets. To delimit a â€˜coreâ€™ set of proteins expressed by all tissues and cells versus proteins that are more specifically expressed, Kim et al.3 identified 2,350 proteins that were found in every sample and accounted for the majority of bulk protein mass. Wilhelm et al.4 compared the five largest human proteomics datasets, including the 27 tissues profiled in-house for this study, to identify 10,000â€“12,000 ubiquitously expressed proteins that primarily function in cellular control and maintenance. To study differential expression patterns, they pooled the 100 most abundant proteins from each tissue and compared the expression of this set of proteins across the dataset. Surprisingly, although these proteins were identified in a majority of samples, their abundance varied by as much as five orders of magnitude. The two studies also investigated additional features of the proteome such as post-translational modifications, isoform-specific expression, protein complexes and translational control. are no longer expressed by human cells. Still others might only be expressed with extreme spatiotemporal specificity and represent gaps that might eventually be filled in by the proteomics community. Aggregating the results of diverse projects to generate â€˜big dataâ€™ has been a considerable challenge in genome sciences, as exemplified by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)7. Aggregation of proteomics data introduces its own unique set of hurdles stemming from the volume of data that must be handled as well as the variability in data quality and sensitivity. Wilhelm et al.4 comment on issues related to data aggregation such as the scalability of the false discovery rate for protein identification. They suggest several reasons why current approaches to estimate false discovery rates do not scale well for big data projects and emphasize the importance of developing new statistical methods to cope with large datasets. They also systematically evaluated several quantification methods before deciding how to integrate data from different sources and concluded that it is feasible to compare disparate samples accurately. A little more than a decade since the initial sequencing of the human genome1,2, two independent research teams have now assembled mass spectrometryâ€“based maps of protein expression throughout the human body3,4. These endeavors complement other ambitious proteomics projects, such as the Human Protein Atlas5, which relies on antibody staining to catalog the precise location of proteins within cells and tissues, and the Human Proteome Project6, a consortium effort that uses both mass spectrometry and antibody technologies to characterize the role of each protein in human biology and disease. The resources generated by the new studiesâ€”Human Proteome Map3 (http://www.humanproteomemap.org/) and ProteomicsDB4 (https:// www.proteomicsdb.org/)â€”should be useful to researchers across the biomedical sciences. Together, the two reports comprise >70 million confidently assigned mass spectra, each of which is like a fingerprint in that it uniquely matches a particular protein fragment. In each study, >17,000 proteins encoded by distinct genes were identified. Kim et al.3 systematically examined 30 different human tissues, including 7 fetal tissues and 6 hematopoietic cell types. Wilhelm et al.4 combined their own data from a similar number of tissues with > 10,000 publicly available raw data files to generate a database encompassing 60 human tissues, 147 cell lines and 13 body fluids. The analyzed specimens included some of the most widely studied tissues, such as liver, heart and kidney, as well as tissues that have received less attention, such as synovial fluid and gall bladder. The 18,097 proteins from Wilhelm et al.4 establish a new baseline for the number of proteins in the human proteome; they represent 92% of open reading frames included in the Swiss-Prot database. The remaining 8% of proteins are missing for various reasons. The authors suggest that several hundred of these proteins are not accessible to mass spectrometric analysis after digestion with commonly used proteases such as trypsin. Many others might be pseudogenesâ€”by-products of evolution that Drafts of the human proteome",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Robert T Lawrence"", ids = ""3874525""); list(name = ""Judit VillÃ©n"", ids = ""47393750"")",99d62cdd2d931084295584c4245723e9e2b2b774; 84030de188947f511ee25935c434da00d0fd755f,6c31a660a78bedd6a5747e912303347311d63be5,Nature Biotechnology,32,752-753

In molecular biology, as in many other scientific fields, the scale of analyses is ever increasing. Often, complex Monte Carlo simulation is required, sometimes within a large-scale multiple testing setting. The resulting computational costs may be prohibitively high.


RESULTS
We here present MCFDR, a simple, novel algorithm for false discovery rate (FDR) modulated sequential Monte Carlo (MC) multiple hypothesis testing. The algorithm iterates between adding MC samples across tests and calculating intermediate FDR values for the collection of tests. MC sampling is stopped either by sequential MC or based on a threshold on FDR. An essential property of the algorithm is that it limits the total number of MC samples whatever the number of true null hypotheses. We show on both real and simulated data that the proposed algorithm provides large gains in computational efficiency.


AVAILABILITY
MCFDR is implemented in the Genomic HyperBrowser (http://hyperbrowser.uio.no/mcfdr), a web-based system for genome analysis. All input data and results are available and can be reproduced through a Galaxy Pages document at: http://hyperbrowser.uio.no/mcfdr/u/sandve/p/mcfdr.

To evaluate differences in cortical-basal ganglia-cerebellar functional connectivity between treated unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) and healthy control cohorts using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI).


STUDY DESIGN
Cross-sectional.


METHODS
Ten UVFP study patients treated by type I thyroplasty and 12 control subjects underwent RS-fMRI on a 3-Tesla scanner to evaluate differences in functional connectivity of whole-brain networks. Spontaneous RS-fMRI data were collected using a gradient echo planar pulse sequence, preprocessed, and analyzed to compare seed-to-voxel maps between the two cohorts. Seeds were placed in the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus divisions of the basal ganglia in both hemispheres. Group contrasts were tested for statistical significance using two-tailed unpaired t tests corrected for multiple comparisons with a cluster false discovery rate threshold of P < .05.


RESULTS
UVFP patients demonstrated increased connectivity between both caudate nuclei and the precuneus, a node of the default mode network, compared to healthy controls. Both caudate nuclei also showed decreased connectivity with the left cerebellar hemisphere. The putamen and globus pallidus divisions of the basal ganglia were not abnormally connected to other brain structures.


CONCLUSIONS
UVFP patients treated by type I thyroplasty exhibited long-term alterations of cortical-basal ganglia-cerebellar networks thought to be important for self-referential voice quality awareness and learning processes that compensate for changes to the paralyzed hemilarynx. This pilot study on relatively small cohorts adds to growing evidence for persistent central nervous system changes in treated UVFP.

b1755c6b07ab7a588c9218ba956e0e6e8013eed4,Global cognitive function and processing speed are associated with gait and balance dysfunction in Parkinsonâ€™s disease,"BackgroundOur primary objective was to determine the relationship between global cognitive function and specific domains of gait and balance in a cohort of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) subjects. In a secondary analysis, we determined whether specific cognitive domains correlated with gait and balance performance.MethodsFourteen PD subjects (mean age 61.1â€‰Â±â€‰7.8Â years) were recruited from the Rush University Medical Center Movement Disorders clinic. Subjects underwent clinical assessment using the motor subsection of the Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) followed by quantitative gait and balance assessments using the APDM Mobility Labâ„¢ system (Mobility Lab, APDM Inc., Portland, OR). Subjects completed global cognitive testing using the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) as well as domain specific cognitive measures. Spearmanâ€™s rho was used to assess correlations between cognitive measures and gait and balance function, with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons.ResultsGlobal cognitive function had the strongest correlation with stride velocity (râ€‰=â€‰0.816, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), turn duration (râ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.806, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), number of steps to turn (râ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.830, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), and mean velocity of postural sway in the medio-lateral direction (râ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.726, pâ€‰=â€‰0.005). A significant correlation was found between processing speed and two turning measures (turn duration, râ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.884, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001; number of steps to turn, râ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.954, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), but no other associations were found between specific cognitive domains and gait domains.ConclusionsThis pilot study provides preliminary data regarding the association between global cognitive function and pace-related measures of gait, turning, and postural sway. Furthermore, reduced processing speed was found to be associated with difficulty in performing turns.",2016,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gian Pal"", ids = ""4390615""); list(name = ""Joan A O'Keefe"", ids = ""1403367792""); list(name = ""Erin E.

6aaa1b0d5302e3e398abef7c2eea8c26c0336454,Lesion evidence for a human mirror neuron system,"More than two decades ago, the mirror neuron system (MNS) was discovered in non-human primates: Single-cell recordings detected visuo-motor neurons that discharged not only when the monkey performed an action, but also when it observed conspecifics performing the same action. It has been proposed that a fronto-parietal circuitry constitutes the human homolog of the MNS. However, the functional role of a human MNS (i.e., whether it is functionally necessary for imitation or action understanding) to date remains controversial. We here examined how patients with left hemisphere (LH) stroke imitate, recognize, and comprehend intransitive meaningful limb actions. In particular, we investigated whether apraxic patients with lesions affecting key nodes of the putative human MNS show deficits in action imitation, action recognition, and action comprehension to a similar degree - as predicted by the MNS hypothesis. Behavioral results showed that patients with apraxia (nÂ =Â 18) indeed performed significantly worse in all three motor cognitive tasks compared to non-apraxic patients (nÂ =Â 26) and healthy controls (nÂ =Â 19), whose performance did not differ significantly. Lesions of the apraxic (compared to non-apraxic) patients with LH stroke affected more frequently key regions of the putative human MNS, i.e., the left inferior frontal, superior temporal, and supramarginal gyri as well as the inferior parietal lobe (pÂ <Â .01, false discovery rate - FDR-corrected). Albeit largely overlapping, voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) revealed that deficits in gesture comprehension were mainly associated with lesions of more anterior parts of the MNS, whereas lesions located more posteriorly mainly resulted in gesture imitation deficits (pÂ <Â .05, FDR-corrected). Our clinical data support key hypotheses derived from the notion of a human MNS: LH lesions to the MNS core regions affected - critically and to a similar extent - the imitation, recognition, and comprehension of meaningful actions.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ellen Binder"", ids = ""145643376""); list(name = ""Anna Dovern"", ids = ""1979958""); list(name = ""Maike D.

52ac57792167043d9c86176fcc2f814b4594d572,Search and decoy: the automatic identification of mass spectra.,"In recent years, the generation and interpretation of MS/MS spectra for the identification of peptides and proteins has matured to a frequently used automatic workflow in Proteomics. Several software solutions for the automated analysis of MS/MS spectra allow for high-throughput/high-performance analyses of complex samples. Related to MS/MS searches, target-decoy approaches have gained more and more popularity: in a ""decoy"" part of the search database nonexistent sequences mimic real sequences (the ""target"" sequences). With their help, the number of falsely identified peptides/proteins can be estimated after a search and the resulting protein list can be cut at a specified false discovery rate (FDR). This is an essential prerequisite for all quantitative approaches, as they rely on correct identifications. Especially the label-free approach ""spectral counting""-gaining more and more popularity due to low costs and simplicity-depends directly on the correctness of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). This work's aim is to describe five popular search engines-especially their general properties regarding protein identification, but also their quantification abilities, if those go beyond spectral counting. By doing so, Proteomics researchers are enabled to compare their features and to choose an appropriate solution for their specific question. Furthermore, the search engines are applied to a spectrum data set generated from a complex sample with a Thermo LTQ Velos OrbiTrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The results of the search engines are compared, e.g., regarding time requirements, peptides and proteins found, and the search engines' behavior using the decoy approach.",2012,Medicine; Physics,"list(name = ""Martin Eisenacher"", ids = ""145677256""); list(name = ""Michael Kohl"", ids = ""3466531""); list(name = ""Michael Turewicz"", ids = ""3410614""); list(name = ""Markus-Hermann Koch"", ids = ""37329541""); list(name = ""Julian Uszkoreit"", ids = ""2159040""); list(name = ""Christian Stephan"", ids = ""2559554"")",c49d8627c5ed0b57619fc190202170ea8f400467; 90fd1242e2566e2d14ad24efedf88b59ebd87eef; 3835629e013423ebce571d61c1730837b92cf7e4,,Methods in molecular biology,893,"

We measured the ratio of mRNA from a maternally expressed imprinted gene, PHLDA2, to that from a paternally expressed imprinted gene, MEST, by Northern blotting in 38 IUGR-associated placentae and 75 non-IUGR placentae and found an increase in the PHLDA2/MEST mRNA ratio in IUGR (p=0.0001). Altered expression of PHLDA2 and MEST was not accompanied by changes in DNA methylation within their imprinting centers, and immunohistochemistry showed PHLDA2 protein appropriately restricted to villous and intermediate cytotrophoblast in the IUGR placentae. We next did a genome-wide survey of mRNA expression in 14 IUGR placentae with maternal vascular under-perfusion compared to 15 non-IUGR placentae using Affymetrix U133A microarrays. In this series six imprinted genes were differentially expressed by ANOVA with a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate of 0.05, with increased expression of PHLDA2 and decreased expression of MEST, MEG3, GATM, GNAS and PLAGL1 in IUGR placentae. At lower significance, we found IGF2 mRNA decreased and CDKN1C mRNA increased in the IUGR cases. We confirmed the significant reduction in MEG3 non-translated RNA in IUGR placentae by Northern blotting. In addition to imprinted genes, the microarray data highlighted non-imprinted genes acting in endocrine signaling (LEP, CRH, HPGD, INHBA), tissue growth (IGF1), immune modulation (INDO, PSG-family genes), oxidative metabolism (GLRX), vascular function (AGTR1, DSCR1) and metabolite transport (SLC-family solute carriers) as differentially expressed in IUGR vs. non-IUGR placentae.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""J McMinn"", ids = ""46309718""); list(name = ""Mingwang Wei"", ids = ""117319944""); list(name = ""Nicole Schupf"", ids = ""4353832""); list(name = ""J.

5428aebc1ff53c82bf647fc965de6e8660bc725e,Differential DNA Methylation in Placenta Associated With Maternal Blood Pressure During Pregnancy,"Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. Abnormal blood pressure during pregnancy is associated with impaired fetal growth, predisposing the offspring to cardiometabolic abnormalities over the life-course. Placental DNA methylation may be the regulatory pathway through which maternal blood pressure influences fetal and adult health outcomes. Epigenome-wide association study of 301 participants with placenta sample examined associations between DNA methylation and millimetre of mercury increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in each trimester. Findings were further examined using gene expression, gene pathway, and functional annotation analyses. Cytosine-(phosphate)-guanine (CpGs) known to be associated with cardiometabolic traits were evaluated. Increased maternal systolic and diastolic blood pressure were associated with methylation of 3 CpGs in the first, 6 CpGs in the second, and 15 CpGs in the third trimester at 5% false discovery rate (P values ranging from 6.6Ã—10âˆ’15 to 2.3Ã—10âˆ’7). Several CpGs were enriched in pathways including cardiovascular-metabolic development (P=1.0Ã—10âˆ’45). Increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure were associated with increased CpG methylation and gene expression at COL12A1, a collagen family gene known for regulatory functions in the heart. Out of 304 previously reported CpGs known to be associated with cardiometabolic traits, 36 placental CpGs were associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure in our data. The present study provides the first evidence for associations between placental DNA methylation and increased maternal blood pressure during pregnancy at genes implicated in cardiometabolic diseases. Identification of blood pressure-associated methylated sites in the placenta may provide clues to early origins of cardiometabolic dysfunction and inform guidelines for early prevention.

2f9bb0b0004bd185f5c18e5f34345cae6d32ac28,Oral contraceptives modify the effect of GATA3 polymorphisms on the risk of asthma at the age of 18 years via DNA methylation,"BackgroundThe prevalence of asthma in girls increases after puberty. Previous studies have detected associations between sex hormones and asthma, as well as between sex hormones and T helper 2 (Th2) asthma-typical immune responses. Therefore, we hypothesized that exogenous or endogenous sex hormone exposure (represented by oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use and early menarche, respectively) are associated with DNA methylation (DNA-M) of the Th2 transcription factor gene, GATA3, in turn affecting the risk of asthma in girls, possibly in interaction with genetic variants.Blood samples were collected from 245 female participants aged 18Â years randomly selected for methylation analysis from the Isle of Wight birth cohort, UK. Information on use of OCPs, age at menarche, and concurrent asthma were assessed by questionnaire. Genome-wide DNA-M was determined using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 beadchip. In a first stage, we tested the interaction between sex hormone exposure and genetic variants on DNA-M of specific cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites. In a second stage, we determined whether these CpG sites interact with genetic variants in GATA3 to explain the risk of asthma.ResultsInteractions between OCP use and seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GATA3 were analyzed for 14 CpG sites (stage 1). The interaction between OCP use and SNP rs1269486 was found to be associated with the methylation level of cg17124583 (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002, false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). DNA-M of this same CpG site was also influenced by the interaction between age at menarche and rs1269486 (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0017). In stage 2, we found that cg17124583 modified the association of SNP rs422628 with asthma risk at the age of 18Â years (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.006, FDR adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). Subjects with genotype AG showed an increase in average risk ratio (RR) from 0.31 (95% CI: 0.10 to 0.8) to 11.65 (95% CI: 1.71 to 79.5) when methylation level increased from 0.02 to 0.12, relative to genotype AA.ConclusionA two-stage model consisting of genetic variants in the GATA3 gene, OCP use, age at menarche, and DNA-M may explain how sex hormones in women can increase the asthma prevalence after puberty.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kranthi Guthikonda"", ids = ""13695244""); list(name = ""Hongmei Zhang"", ids = ""30133375""); list(name = ""Vikki G Nolan"", ids = ""3907824""); list(name = ""NelÃ­s Soto-RamÃ­rez"", ids = ""1401970971""); list(name = ""Ali H Ziyab"", ids = ""5495406""); list(name = ""Susan Ewart"", ids = ""3321392""); list(name = ""Hasan S.

Here we present data of five development players from a major league baseball team. The aims were to evaluate the feasibility of conducting sessions within a professional organization, assess changes in quantitative electroencephalograph (QEEG), NeuroPerformance Profileâ„¢, and report qualitative self-report data before and after brain training. The EEG was recorded with 19 electrodes for 20Â min of baseline conditions and approximately 21Â min of a continuous performance test. The fast Fourier transform analysis provided average cross-spectral matrices for bands delta (1â€“3.5Â Hz), theta (4â€“7.5Â Hz), alpha (8â€“12Â Hz), low beta (13â€“16Â Hz), beta 1 (13â€“21Â Hz), beta 2 (22â€“32Â Hz), and gamma (32â€“45Â Hz) from the pre and post intervention evaluations in the baseline condition of eyes open. The continuous performance test metrics included the errors of omission, errors of commission, response time and response time variability. The 9 scales of the NeuroPerformance Profileâ„¢ were examined. The QEEG data, CPT data and NeuroPerformance Profileâ„¢ data were all compared between the pre and post 15 sessions of brain training using a within subject paired t test design corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate method. Following brain training, comparative QEEG, CPT and NeuroPerformance Profileâ„¢ analyses illustrated significant differences. The QEEG findings of all participants illustrated significant changes within the training parameters but also across other frequency bands and electrode sites. Overall, the positive findings in both objective and subjective measures suggest further inquiry into the utility of brain training for performance enhancement with the specific application of sport is warranted. Particularly QEEG and CPT gains were noted in the areas that correspond to client self-report data demonstrating improvement in attention, decreased intrusive thought patterns and improvements in sleep patterns.",2013,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Leslie H.

910ddcb449bcb06fea11dcfce6a0cc8ee1b8e6a5,An epigenetic clock for human skeletal muscle,"Background Ageing is associated with DNA methylation changes in all human tissues, and epigenetic markers can estimate chronological age based on DNA methylation patterns across tissues. However, the construction of the original pan-tissue epigenetic clock did not include skeletal muscle samples, and hence exhibited a strong deviation between DNA methylation and chronological age in this tissue. Methods To address this, we developed a more accurate, muscle-specific epigenetic clock based on the genome-wide DNA methylation data of 682 skeletal muscle samples from 12 independent datasets (18-89 years old, 22% women, 99% Caucasian), all generated with Illumina HumanMethylation arrays (HM27, HM450 or HMEPIC). We also took advantage of the large number of samples to conduct an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of age-associated DNA methylation patterns in skeletal muscle. Results The newly developed clock uses 200 CpGs to estimate chronological age in skeletal muscle, 16 of which are in common with the 353 CpGs of the pan-tissue clock. The muscle clock outperformed the pan-tissue clock, with a median error of only 4.6 years across datasets (vs 13.1 years for the pan-tissue clock, p < 0.0001) and an average correlation of Ï = 0.62 between actual and predicted age across datasets (vs Ï = 0.51 for the pan-tissue clock). Lastly, we identified 180 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with age in skeletal muscle at a False Discovery Rate < 0.005. However, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis did not reveal any enrichment for Gene Ontologies. Conclusions We have developed a muscle-specific epigenetic clock that predicts age with better accuracy than the pan-tissue clock. We implemented the muscle clock in an R package called MEAT available on Bioconductor to estimate epigenetic age in skeletal muscle samples. This clock may prove valuable in assessing the impact of environmental factors, such as exercise and diet, on muscle-specific biological ageing processes.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Sarah Voisin"", ids = ""2052291""); list(name = ""Nicholas R Harvey"", ids = ""1473682401""); list(name = ""L.

To examine the potential contribution of adipose tissue to NAFLD progression, we performed a complete transcriptomic analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on intra-abdominal adipose tissue (IAT) from severely obese adolescents [Mage 16.9 Â± 0.4 yr, body mass index (BMI) z-score 2.7 Â± 0.1] undergoing bariatric surgery and liver biopsy categorized into three groups: no steatosis (normal, n = 8), steatosis only (n = 13), or NASH (n = 10) by liver histology. Age, body weight, and BMI did not differ among groups, but subjects with NASH were more insulin resistant (increased homeostatic model assessment/insulin resistance, P < 0.05 vs. other groups). RNA-Seq revealed 175 up- and 492 downregulated mRNA transcripts (â‰¥Â±1.5-fold, false discovery rate <0.10) in IAT between NASH vs. Normal, with ""mitochondrial dysfunction, P = 4.19E-7"" being the top regulated canonical pathway identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; only 19 mRNA transcripts were up- and 148 downregulated when comparing Steatosis vs. Normal, with suppression of ""EIF2 signaling, P = 1.79E-27"" being the top regulated pathway indicating increased cellular stress. A comparison of IAT between NASH vs. Steatosis found 515 up- and 175 downregulated genes, with ""antigen presentation, P = 6.03E-18"" being the top regulated canonical pathway and ""inflammatory response"" the top diseases and disorders function.

7ff53574c542f329299a865e0f14f014adcb2b33,Discovery of Biomarkers for Tasmanian Devil Cancer (DFTD) by Metabolic Profiling of Serum.,"Devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) is a transmissible cancer threatening Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) with extinction. There is no preclinical test available for DFTD, and thus our aim was to find biomarkers for DFTD by metabolic fingerprinting. Seventy serum samples from wild Tasmanian devils (35 controls, 35 with tumors) were analyzed by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. Features were selected by multivariate models (PLS/DA, random forests) comparing age-matched training set (n = 20 Ã— 2) and further complying with fold-change threshold (â‰¥1.4) and Mann-Whitney U-tests with correction for multiple hypotheses (false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.05). An array of overlapping peptide segments of the N-terminal end of fibrinogen were the strongest positive DFTD markers. These peptides recorded fold-change up to 90, FDR-corrected p value below 0.01, and area under ROC curve of at least 0.80 and also correlated with tumor size (Spearman R > 0.45, p < 0.01). Additional potential markers included amino acid and lipid metabolites, while cortisol and urea were the most significant health predictors (AUC â‰¥ 0.90). PLS/DA resulted in AUC = 0.997 for the training set and overall sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 97%. A support vector machine model utilizing only the major peptide marker and seven other metabolites led to overall 94% sensitivity and specificity. The novel findings in this first DFTD metabolomics study shed light on metabolic changes in Tasmanian devils affected by DFTD and provide a valuable step toward the development of prognostic biomarkers.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Naama Karu"", ids = ""7224246""); list(name = ""Richard Wilson"", ids = ""145532973""); list(name = ""Rodrigo K Hamede"", ids = ""4565211""); list(name = ""Menna E.

7fab74984d97b748b543404267efdb6536a1847f,Association between mercury in cord serum and sex-specific DNA methylation in cord tissues.,"Prenatal exposure to mercury in utero causes abnormal foetal growth and adverse outcomes. DNA methylation is currently considered a possible mechanism through which this occurs. However, few studies have investigated the association between prenatal exposure to mercury and DNA methylation in detail. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between prenatal exposure to total mercury (Hg) and DNA methylation and its associations with sex-specific characteristics in male and female offspring. In a birth cohort study known as the Chiba study of Mother and Child Health, the DNA methylation status in cord tissue and Hg concentrations in cord serum were examined. A total of 67 participants (27 males and 40 females) were analysed based on Spearman's correlations, adjusted by a false discovery rate of the sex of each offspring. Only one methylated locus was positively correlated with Hg concentrations in cord serum in male offspring, but not in female offspring, and was annotated to the haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain-containing protein 1 (HDHD1) gene on chromosome X. This locus was located in the intron of the HDHD1 gene body and is a binding site for the zinc finger protein CCCTC-binding factor. One of the other loci, located in HDHD1, was highly methylated in the group with higher mercury concentrations, and this locus was in the gene body of HDHD1. Our results suggest that prenatal exposure to Hg might affect the epigenetic status of male foetuses.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shino Nishizawa-Jotaki"", ids = ""1423464105""); list(name = ""Kenichi Sakurai"", ids = ""143840630""); list(name = ""Akifumi Eguchi"", ids = ""115036030""); list(name = ""Hiromi Tanabe"", ids = ""122676242""); list(name = ""Masahiro Watanabe"", ids = ""49888198""); list(name = ""Chisato Mori"", ids = ""50853004"")",,,Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,,"

In a 2x3 paradigm, subjects had to move their index fingers either in symmetric or in parallel mode in a congruous position, i.e. both palms down, and in two incongruous positions, i.e. either the left or right palm up, respectively. fMRI data were analysed with general linear model (random effects analysis) in an omnibus statistics and with small volume correction based on the main movement effect of all six conditions in comparison with rest. Significant signal changes had a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 exceeding clusters of 50 activated voxels. Results: In the incongruous conditions compared with the congruous condition, there was an fMRI-signal increase in a bilateral fronto-parietal network involving motor, premotor somatosensory, and inferior parietal cortical areas. Whereas turning the right hand evoked a predominantly contralateral pattern in right-handers, activations were more bilaterally in the left-handers. In addition, the occipito-temporal cortex probably corresponding to human visual area MT was activated bilaterally in the left-handers. The activation of area MT was specific for the incongruouscongruous contrast in the left-handers but detectable in comparison with rest also in the right-handers. Conclusion: Our observations show extra-activations in sensorimotor control areas during a perceptual dissociation in rightand left-handers. In addition, our data suggest an involvement of visual imagery in the sensory guidance of bimanual coordination in left-handers.",2010,Psychology,"list(name = ""T. -C.

While reliable identification of post-translational modifications (PTMs) is key to understanding various cellular regulatory processes, adequate configuration of existing tools remains a challenging task. In this context, it becomes crucial to carefully assess the accuracy of identification of expected modifications. We discuss methods to quantify the false discovery rate from a search and illustrate how several features can be used to distinguish valid modifications from search artifacts. In addition, we describe two open-source unrestrictive PTM search algorithms, MS-Alignment and Spectral Networks, that search for all types of PTMs at once in blind mode (i.e. without knowing in advance which PTMs to search for). While MS-Alignment capitalizes on spectral alignment to identify modified variants of peptides in a database, Spectral Networks directly align unidentified spectra to discover PTMs and highly-modified peptides. InsPecT, MS-Alignment and Spectral Networks are freely available as open-source packages and web services at http://proteomics.ucsd.edu.",2010,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Nuno Bandeira"", ids = ""2865038"")",,,Journal of biomolecular techniques,21,
61c372195d51083822494dfc6772d4dde8629c6a,Gut Microbiota Composition and Fecal Metabolic Phenotype in Patients With Acute Anterior Uveitis.,"Purpose
To investigate gut microbiota composition and fecal metabolic phenotype in patients with acute anterior uveitis.


Methods
Fecal DNA was extracted from 78 fecal samples (38 acute anterior uveitis (AAU) patients and 40 family members of patients or sex- and age-matched healthy controls) and then sequenced by high-throughput 16S rDNA analysis. Gas chromatographic mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolomics was performed on 60 fecal samples (30 AAU patients and 30 healthy controls).


Results
A significant difference was observed in beta diversity between AAU patients and healthy controls. Eight genera including Roseburia were reduced in AAU patients, and Veillonella was increased in AAU patients as compared with healthy controls. Significance was however lost after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. The expression of seven fecal metabolites including 6-deoxy-D-glucose 1, linoleic acid, N-Acetyl-beta-D-mannosamine 3, shikimic acid, azelaic acid, isomaltose 1 and palmitoleic acid was increased in AAU patients.

a83ab8650ce74e017a34b3933951aa747e80c86c,Profiling of Selected MicroRNAs in Proliferative Eutopic Endometrium of Women with Ovarian Endometriosis,"It has been well documented that aberrant expression of selected microRNAs (miRNAs) might contribute to the pathogenesis of disease. The aim of the present study is to compare miRNA expression by the most comprehensive locked-nucleic acid (LNA) miRNA microarray in eutopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis and control. In the study we recruited 21 patients with endometriosis and 25 were disease-free women. The miRNA expression profiles were determined using the LNA miRNA microarray and validated for selected molecules by real-time PCR. We identified 1198 human miRNAs significantly differentially altered in endometriosis versus control samples using false discovery rate of <5%. However only 136 miRNAs showed differential regulation by fold change of at least 1.3. By the use of selected statistical analysis we obtained 45 potential pathways that might play a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. We also found that natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity pathway was found to be inhibited which is consistent with previous studies. There are several pathways that may be potentially dysregulated, due to abnormal miRNA expression, in eutopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis and in this way contribute to its pathogenesis.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Piotr Laudanski"", ids = ""3730269""); list(name = ""Radoslaw Charkiewicz"", ids = ""6102626""); list(name = ""Agnieszka ToÅ‚wiÅ„ska"", ids = ""1902166""); list(name = ""Jacek Szamatowicz"", ids = ""5283488""); list(name = ""Alicja Charkiewicz"", ids = ""49341879""); list(name = ""Jacek NikliÅ„ski"", ids = ""3881549"")",57c6fdcaaab8274bd730092cd6e7b1aad8c4ffef; 326e5b128ac615c521cb54804fcde335ba50f758; cfd0fc67e5cd5320233c9bad53dcf25e92c19306; 784db7744a5b4d75babf4a38c9e5bcf75a32c911; 7fcce915180178a7bf1cff385804c07d0293b3b1; ee8b273df9a639311006e83e91f8b829cfff6333; 4b6b3a72a2924912c8ec6098341c34c4d96a7965; c0c14aec86613a0fb006100ccf16965be659f53b; d3aac5c9cfc4cad79f3d9ed39b2ac0726e93e788; 5eab244fab793f7797dfada9e2ea151c2f7aff84; 51b86ee1e5e034db473a0341b578c4cb7364ccd5; 98302ddb351f29f4d71b6e7b30156b4492b00670; 14caff13ab3841a957cdcfadd75ca2bc6869d77c,3f78f3cb21cb9564f4fee55a8761844d5dd193ea; 04a2ccf930adadaf99d7e8ef15675d0d935ed89e; 953d7c60cefc8f2d5cfd88b96be3d6397aad94dd; ec18289446c8d300d3ac1e8dbce8b81baf2ca00a; 4df1ee2955b90258c8aeb25d032c71c4c21e042f; d888204bcde877082651aed8c2d208f445b4238f; 7df236cc2b2298d583addf2537ea96c0b451759e; 62ee998fd42d838b7e3091a07eb8be6cc4771f82; 79f5805b2ae8bd2de83c6fa9b9b4d497a6e48e6b; 837b203f361a6f209823e6cf853aaab571f6b018; 82bcc7cb0d9032f63912696ca9a98a074567416e; 8c333c35a238156e43fea69cd4bfe6efa1b222ff; f086c8ad305c3a9f770309f438731e4ddc8ad165; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; 455ce65e42d412c620cab03054731fc645657cd8; c876c5154ebff7a1b2111c52c75d268d62ad3240; 00648fbbab9a50dbff31310bf27eae1c50bf2505; 4b2532bc36a8bdd893af789d6c573f6fc572b4b4; 1c8043ab192f5235f4d039d2465f7c729d0dd9b0; af2b56b9887cb04d4148cde277f1a6ac643dab1d; cf61e0acac5fd6a9ec1f30e1392c7c2f5e9f88cf; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; ec809bec4cfb843d23038e3aed2d62ce82691caf; 44bc2cd1574307d65a0de98b4c730a96b6bb7b95; 2601cd4f8d5ebd2566d60bf5ce8f60eb95176089; 18eec8ad10fcbc1bed4746a01a7409c034267067; 61bbd7e6d5cc74f8af71865a3449fd5d08575e2c; 2c7d12c5c9d11fab250b2f5b4df6f59e0356adaf; 401195913892443c958e8aef50b3c3190f6a34ae; a446ddc3404e8b32ebb34c38e6df1c36bc2f240e; e66b7172ec04e48fa6e53d6a15b4508f269dec8f; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; 3b7a7a1e81d2f0f4616cf266f5ef9680b66412b5; 34ada90fa4ddef0a8c7b31084e8bebfedf3fc30a; 068f61c7ad22ebaca6c6ad989447d33a22934258; daaf1d107ba346498d7806b8f9ba9d25f7c9abe3; fe853d5753eeb0752d11977dd78633c512f683e0,BioMed Research International,2015,
5cca3c697c7e5e4726e207e12bd765d9c9ba3b62,"Promoting Early, Safe Return to Work in Injured Employees: A Randomized Trial of a Supervisor Training Intervention in a Healthcare Setting","Purpose Supervisors in the healthcare sector have the potential to contribute to disability prevention in injured employees. Published data on the evaluation of return to work (RTW) interventions aimed at direct supervisors are scarce. We sought to determine the effect of a brief audiovisual supervisor training module on supervisor RTW attitudes and knowledge. Methods A parallel-group study, using equal randomization, comparing the training module intervention to usual practice in healthcare supervisors at a quaternary care hospital was conducted. Differences between groups in changes in RTW attitude and knowledge survey question scores between baseline and 3Â months were assessed using the Mannâ€“Whitney U test. The Benjaminiâ€“Hochbergâ€“Yekutieli procedure was used to control for false discovery rate and generate adjusted p values. Results Forty supervisors were allocated to the intervention group and 41 to the usual practice group. Attitude and knowledge scores for most questions improved between baseline and immediately after intervention administration. Comparing intervention (nÂ =Â 33) and usual practice groups (nÂ =Â 37), there was a trend toward greater increase between baseline and 3Â months follow-up in agreement that the supervisor can manage the RTW process (UÂ =Â 515, adjusted p valueÂ =Â 0.074) and in confidence that the supervisor can answer employeesâ€™ questions (UÂ =Â 514, adjusted p valueÂ =Â 0.074) in the intervention group, although these findings were not statistically significant. Conclusions The training intervention may have provided the initial tools for supervisors to navigate the RTW process in collaboration with others in the RTW community of practice.

The inability to control die spacer thickness has been reported. However, little information is available on the congruency between the computer-aided design parameters for die spacer thickness and the actual printout.


PURPOSE
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the die spacer thickness achieved by combining computer-aided design and 3-dimensional printing technology.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
An ivorine maxillary central incisor was prepared for a ceramic crown. The prepared tooth was duplicated by using polyvinyl siloxane duplicating silicone, and 80 die-stone models were produced from Type IV dental stone. The dies were randomly divided into 5 groups with assigned die spacer thicknesses of 25 Î¼m, 45 Î¼m, 65 Î¼m, 85 Î¼m, and 105 Î¼m (n=16). The printed resin copings, obtained from a printer (ProJet DP 3000; 3D Systems), were cemented onto their respective die-stone models with self-adhesive resin cement and stored at room temperature until sectioning into halves in a buccolingual direction. The internal gap was measured at 5 defined locations per side of the sectioned die. Images of the printed resin coping/die-stone model internal gap dimensions were obtained with an inverted bright field metallurgical microscope at Ã—100 magnification. The acquired digital image was calibrated, and measurements were made using image analysis software. Mixed models (Î±=.05) were used to evaluate accuracy. A false discovery rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple testing. Coefficient of variation was used to determine the precision for each group and was evaluated statistically with the Wald test (Î±=.05).


RESULTS
The accuracy, expressed in terms of the mean differences between the prescribed die spacer thickness and the measured internal gap (standard deviation), was 50 Î¼m (11) for the 25 Î¼m group simulated die spacer thickness, 30 Î¼m (10) for the 45 Î¼m group, 15 Î¼m (14) for the 65 Î¼m group, 3 Î¼m (23) for the 85 Î¼m group, and -10 Î¼m (32) for the 105 Î¼m group. The precision mean of the measurements, expressed as a coefficient of variation, ranged between 14% and 33% for the 5 groups.


CONCLUSIONS
For the accuracy evaluation, statistically significant differences were found for all the groups, except the group of 85 Î¼m.

3040df75f7209edcbd28ba45830460ab60cbe023,M61: Shared Genetic Variants Between Schizophrenia And General Cognitive Function Indicate Common Molecular Genetic Mechanisms,"Background Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe mental disorder characterized by widespread cognitive impairments including deficits in learning, memory, processing speed, attention and executive functioning. Although cognitive deficits are a strong predictor of functional outcome in SCZ, current treatment strategies largely fail to ameliorate these impairments. Thus, in order to develop more efficient treatment strategies in SCZ, a better understanding of the pathogenesis of these cognitive deficits is needed. Given that both SCZ and cognitive ability are substantially heritable, we here aimed to determine whether SCZ share genetic influences with general cognitive function (COG), a phenotype that captures the shared variation in performance across several cognitive domains. Methods We analyzed GWAS results in the form of summary statistics (p-values and z-scores) from SCZ (the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium; n=82 315) and COG (CHARGE Consortium; n=53 949). We applied a conditional false discovery rate (FDR) framework. By leveraging SNP-associations in a secondary trait (SCZ or COG), the conditional FDR approach increases power to detect loci in the primary trait (COG or SCZ), regardless of the directions of allelic effects of the risk loci. We then applied the conjunction FDR to identify shared loci between the phenotypes. The conjunction FDR is defined as the maximum of the conditional FDRs for both directions, and we used an overall FDR threshold of 0.05. Results To visualize pleiotropic enrichment, we constructed conditional Q-Q plots which indicate substantial polygenetic overlap between SCZ and COG. For progressively stringent p-value thresholds for SCZ SNPs, we found approximately 150-fold enrichment for COG. For progressively stringent p-value thresholds for COG SNPs, we found approximately 100-fold enrichment for SCZ. We then used the conjunction FDR and identified fourteen independent loci shared between SCZ and COG. The majority of the shared loci show inverse associations in SCZ and COG, in line with the observed cognitive dysfunction in SCZ. Discussion Our preliminary findings indicate shared molecular genetic mechanisms between SCZ and COG, which may provide important new insights into the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction in SCZ.",2017,Psychology,"list(name = ""Olav B.

To gain more insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms, we applied isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling coupled with on-line two-dimensional LC/MS/MS technology to identify proteins differentially expressed in an in vitro model for chondrogenesis: chondrogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells, a murine embryonic mesenchymal cell line, was induced by micromass culture and 100 ng/ml bone morphogenetic protein 2 treatment for 6 days. A total of 1756 proteins were identified with an average false discovery rate <0.21%. Linear regression analysis of the quantitative data gave strong correlation coefficients: 0.948 and 0.923 for two replicate two-dimensional LC/MS/MS analyses and 0.881, 0.869, and 0.927 for three independent iTRAQ experiments, respectively (p < 0.0001). Among 1753 quantified proteins, 100 were significantly altered (95% confidence interval), and six of them were further validated by Western blotting. Functional categorization revealed that the 17 up-regulated proteins mainly comprised hallmarks of mature chondrocytes and enzymes participating in cartilage extracellular matrix synthesis, whereas the 83 down-regulated were predominantly involved in energy metabolism, chromatin organization, transcription, mRNA processing, signaling transduction, and cytoskeleton; except for a number of well documented proteins, the majority of these altered proteins were novel for chondrogenesis. Finally, the biological roles of BTF3l4 and fibulin-5, two novel chondrogenesis-related proteins identified in the present study, were verified in the context of chondrogenic differentiation. These data will provide valuable clues for our better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that modulate these complex biological processes and assist in the application of MSCs in cell-based therapy for cartilage regeneration.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yu-hua Ji"", ids = ""11993494""); list(name = ""Ju-ling Ji"", ids = ""12893587""); list(name = ""Fen-yong Sun"", ids = ""36166098""); list(name = ""Yao-ying Zeng"", ids = ""8507098""); list(name = ""Xian-Hui He"", ids = ""50045980""); list(name = ""Jing-xian Zhao"", ids = ""11447251""); list(name = ""Yu Yu"", ids = ""144398247""); list(name = ""Shou-he Yu"", ids = ""15941205""); list(name = ""Wei Wu"", ids = ""47203382"")",7a7a4e65e58314628f4928b497d8855d298c8e16; 7658b3e60388a590ae79931bbd15825610e8e6b8; 55155a61fce036e19ce7f631efab6adcbbc4d78c; 2dbd3f7cdf0f333e416b6e7e35c7a0378a191b40; eaff8e3755f15d1b8b07b255f1e5e88cc906d10e; d1ec08382cf064ec828029c278734fead4818e51; 077a7e163fe2b83ad5f4fe3f379d9ab404713c65; d49e56bd68af10bf39bb7d3936fb16511ff32eeb; f194530f9fee144fc3cae7d9c57ecd84f8c257f2; f926b98666a460395531dd9aa055a6b904d945c1; 7aeb350d8fd7831f9f9105efa6e3e02b16bb2f73; 22f6e481fb0d57bdf2ed093ce0f909cacd0779e7; e9629baa52b6b6f3d63591353924df28fd0c83e8; 0d2f19036da33e7955a07c443f9444b71d7dacd8; 2a20bd1f6802dd25c16f15fb5ee6fe137937618d; 568a7b4fd9c11f857668316c85ee584b3a2083b7; 9782dabe9c19c8d5df01a10697c2f483afffcfb5; 6f9df09cb25271c348abe33918ebe29ef2ee8c25; 46802d9d2cd7ab5a09e53570c4129bf34f326d5c; 4ed2c9cd925c51120135249ac256c8fa8c7c9d81; 3cf979ebae28336ae899d527b2a83c58e1a28267; 6167992f619196d686c4f4029d191eee2e658f18; 55b6a5bf1b9afed1063011c6fd3ba19a4c7e4dbe; 46b95ac43cc229b80eb4d0fb57471dcbc7c61ff0; 5ea63690b32d1a1113ca1e99cc126840305ccf86; d314e81c1695f39853b2c9e74910d47502da6c07; 60de9673e6ab5c4c63c4d47d195df5e56024d7f7; 0fc7c2b97d67b7853f5fc5617d3d761b1057f306; b0faabb51a689c09b4f25794de423926f8c681a6; 84625bcfc9557162279ef8c3aa052d1957cb3d68; b8fa24f4543167746ad64dd3edbf830d2e7d28bd,,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,9 3,"

There exist various approaches to approximating the correct genomewide p-values under various assumptions, either by way of asymptotics or simulations. We explore a philosophically different criterion, recently proposed in the literature, which controls the false discovery rate. The test statistics are assumed to arise from a mixture of distributions under the null and non-null hypotheses. We fit the mixture distribution using both a nonparametric approach and commingling analysis, and then apply the local false discovery rate to select cut-off points for regions to be declared interesting. Another criterion, the minimum total error, is also explored. Both criteria seem to be sensible alternatives to controlling the classical type I and type II error rates.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ritwik Sinha"", ids = ""2703103""); list(name = ""Moumita Sinha"", ids = ""145016365""); list(name = ""George Mathew"", ids = ""152725988""); list(name = ""Robert C.

451c2b09f99f7f99046863e8df49627776838e54,Simultaneous Statistical Inference,"We introduce the problem of simultaneous statistical inference, with particular emphasis on testing multiple hypotheses. After a historic overview, general notation for the whole work is set up and different sources of multiplicity are distinguished. We define a variety of classical and modern type I and type II error rates in multiple hypotheses testing, analyze some relationships between them, and consider different ways to cope with structured systems of hypotheses. Relationships between multiple testing and other simultaneous statistical inference problems, in particular the construction of confidence regions for multi-dimensional parameters, as well as selection, ranking and partitioning problems, are elucidated. Finally, a general outline of the remainder of the work is given. Simultaneous statistical inference is concerned with the problem of making several decisions simultaneously based on one and the same dataset. In this work, simultaneous statistical decision problems will mainly be formalized by multiple hypotheses andmultiple tests. Not all simultaneous statistical decision problems are given in this formulation in the first place, but they can often be re-formulated in terms of multiple test problems. General relationships between multiple testing and other kinds of simultaneous statistical decision problems will briefly be discussed in Sect. 1.3. Moreover, we will refer to specific connections at respective occasions. For instance, we will elucidate connections between multiple testing and binary classification in Chap.6 and discuss multiple testing methods in the context of model selection in Chap.7. The origins of multiple hypotheses testing can at least be traced back to Bonferroni (1935, 1936). The â€œBonferroni correctionâ€(cf. Example 3.1) is a generic method for evaluating several statistical tests simultaneously and ensuring that the probability for at least one type I error is bounded by a pre-defined significance level Î±. The latter criterion is nowadays referred to as (strong) control of the familywise error rate (FWER) at level Î± and will be defined formally in Definition 1.2 below. In well-defined model classes, the Bonferroni method can be improved. In the 1950s, especially analysis of variance (ANOVA) models have been studied with respect to multiple comparisons of group-specific means. For instance, Tukey (1953) T. Dickhaus, Simultaneous Statistical Inference, 1 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-45182-9_1, Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014 2 1 The Problem of Simultaneous Inference developed a multiple test for all pairwise comparisons of means in ANOVA models based on the studentized range distribution. Keuls (1952) applied this technique to a ranking problem of ANOVAmeans in an agricultural context. The works of Dunnett (1955, 1964) treated the problem ofmultiple comparisonswith a control group, while ScheffÃ© (1953) provided a method for testing general linear contrasts simultaneously in the ANOVA context.Concepts from multivariate analysis and probability theory, in particular multivariate dependency concepts, have also been used for multiple testing, cf. for instance the works by Å idÃ¡k (1967, 1968, 1971, 1973). These concepts allow for establishing probability bounds which in turn can be used for adjusting significance levels for multiplicity. We will provide details in Sect. 4.3. While all the aforementioned historical methods lead to single-step tests (meaning that the same, multiplicity-adjusted critical value is used for all test statistics corresponding to the considered tests), the formal introduction of the closed test principle byMarcus et al. (1976) paved the way for stepwise rejective multiple tests (for a detailed description of these different classes of multiple test procedures, see Chap.3). These stepwise rejective tests are often improvements of the classical single-step tests with respect to power, meaning that they allow (on average) for more rejections of false hypotheses while controlling the same type I error criterion (namely, the FWER at a given level of significance). Stepwise rejective FWER-controlling multiple tests have been developed in the late 1970s, the 1980s and early 1990s; see, for example, Holm (1977, 1979), Hommel (1988) (based on Simes (1986)), Hochberg (1988), and Rom (1990). Around this time, the theory of FWER control had reached a high level of sophistication and was treated in the monographs by Hochberg and Tamhane (1987) and Hsu (1996). It is fair to say that a new era of multiple testing began when Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) introduced a new type I error criterion, namely control of the false discovery rate (FDR), see Definition 1.2. Instead of bounding the probability of one or more type I errors, the FDR criterion bounds the expected proportion of false positives among all significant findings, which typically implies to allow for a few type I errors; see also Seeger (1968) and SoriÄ‡ (1989) for earlier instances of this idea. During the past 20years, simultaneous statistical inference and, in particular, multiple statistical hypothesis testing has become amajor branch of mathematical and applied statistics, cf. Benjamini (2010) for some bibliometric details. Even for experts it is hardly possible to keep track of the exponentially (over time) growing literature in the field. This growing importance is not least due to the data-analytic challenges posed by large-scale experiments in modern life sciences such as, for instance, genetic association studies (cf. Chap.9), gene expression studies (Chap.10), functional magnetic resonance imaging (Chap.11), and brain-computer interfacing (Chap.12). Hence, the present work is attempting to explain some of the most important theoretical basics of simultaneous statistical inference, togetherwith applications in diverse areas of the life sciences. 1.1 Sources of Multiplicity 3 1.1 Sources of Multiplicity The following definition is fundamental for the remainder of this work. Definition 1.1 (Statistical model). A statistical model is a triple (X ,F ,P). In this,X denotes the sample space (the set of all possible observations),F a Ïƒ -field on X (the set of all events that we can assign a probability to) and P a family of probability measures on the measurable space (X ,F ). Often, we will write P in the form (PÎ¸)Î¸âˆˆÎ˜ , such that the family is indexed by the parameter Î¸ of the model which can take values in the parameter space Î˜ , where Î˜ may have infinite dimension. Unless stated otherwise, an observation will be denoted by x âˆˆ X , and we think of x as the realization of a random variate X which mathematically formalizes the data-generating mechanism. The target of statistical inference is the parameter Î¸ which we regard as the unknown and unobservable state of nature. Once the statistical model for the data-generating process at hand is defined, two general types of resulting multiplicity can be labeled as â€œoneor twosample problemswithmultiple endpointsâ€ and â€œk-sample problemswith localized comparisonsâ€, where k > 2, respectively. In oneor twosample problems with multiple endpoints, the sample space is often of the form X = RmÃ—n . The same n observational units are measured with respect to m different endpoints, where we assumed for ease of presentation that every measurement results in a real number. The transfer to measurements of other type (for instance, allele pairs at genetic loci) is straightforward. For every of them endpoints, an own scientific question can be of interest. On the contrary, in k-sample problemswith localized comparisons, the sample space is typically of the form X = R âˆ‘k i=1 ni , meaning that k > 2 different groups of observational units (for instance, corresponding to k different doses of a drug) are considered, and that ni observations are made in group i , where 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ k. In this, all âˆ‘k i=1 ni measurements concern one and the same endpoint (for instance, a disease status). The scientific questions in the latter case typically relate to differences between the k groups. Multiplicity arises, if not (only) general homogeneity or heterogeneity between the groups shall be assessed, but if differences, if any, are to be localized in the sense that we want to find out which groups are different. Two classical examples are the â€œall pairsâ€ problem (all m = k(k âˆ’ 1)/2 pairwise group comparisons are of interest) and the â€œmultiple comparisons with a controlâ€ problem (group k is a reference group and all other m = k âˆ’ 1 groups are to be compared with group k). We will primarily focus on these two kinds of problems. However, it has to be mentioned that they do not cover the whole spectrum of simultaneous statistical inference problems. For instance, flexible (group-sequential and adaptive) study designs induce a different type of multiplicity problem that we will not consider in the present work. Throughout the remainder, we will try to stick to the notation developed in this section: m is the number of comparisons (the multiplicity of the problem), n or a subscripted n denotes a sample size and k refers to the total number of groups in a 4 1 The Problem of Simultaneous Inference k-sample problem or to the dimensionality of the parameter Î¸ . Often, the two latter quantities are identical. 1.2 Multiple Hypotheses Testing In what follows, we (sometimes implicitly) identify statistical hypotheses with nonempty subsets of the parameter space Î˜ . The tuple (X ,F , (PÎ¸)Î¸âˆˆÎ˜,H ) denotes a multiple test problem, where H = (Hi : i âˆˆ I ) for an arbitrary index set I defines a family of null hypotheses. The resulting alternative hypotheses are denoted by Ki = Î˜ \ Hi , i âˆˆ I . The intersection hypothesis H0 =â‹‚iâˆˆI Hi will be referred to as global hypothesis. Throughout the work, we assume that H0 is non-empty.With very few exceptions, we will consider the case of finite families of hypotheses, meaning that |I | = m âˆˆ N. In such cases, we will often writeHm instead ofH and index the hypotheses such ",2014,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Thorsten Dickhaus"", ids = ""46649155"")",a93403de78b3296ba2f330ca1e2a4a705641b68a;

6e9191dd03a4b16401d541ab759d1791f0f0d3b9,SOLiD SAGE sequencing shows differential gene expression in jejunal lymph node samples of resistant and susceptible red deer (Cervus elaphus) challenged with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis.,"This study compared in vivo lymph node gene expression levels between six young red deer that were either relatively resistant (R) or susceptible (S) to paratuberculosis following experimental challenge with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Intestinal lymph nodes were biopsied at 4, 12 and 50 weeks post challenge (pc) and parallel changes in histopathology, immunology and bacterial load monitored. SOLiD SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) next generation sequencing of biopsied lymph node samples generated a total of 373 million transcript tags 26-28bp in length after filtering. A total of 36,632 unique transcripts were identified and 14,325 of these were able to be annotated. The copy number of each transcript was counted, averaged and compared for R and S animals (R-S). P values and False Discovery Rates (FDR) were calculated for each transcript. Genes differentially upregulated â‰¥2 fold (FDR<0.5) totalled 9, 40 and 32 in R animals (+ values) and 23, 164 and 47 in S animals (- values) at weeks 4, 12, and 50pc, respectively. Transcripts displaying greatest differential expression between R and S animals at each time point were IFIT2 (189 fold) and S100A8 (-32.7 fold) at week 4, LRR1 (52.7 fold), SERPINF2 (-214.6 fold) at week 12 and CEACAM8 (84.6 fold), and STK31 (-129.5 fold) at week 50, respectively. All 9 genes significantly upregulated at week 4 in R animals relate specifically to host defence and all involve Type I interferon stimulated genes. By contrast genes upregulated in S animals at week 4, relate predominantly to inflammation, but also involve adaptive immune responses, mitochondrial function and apoptosis regulation. At week 12, the genes differentially upregulated in R animals are linked predominantly to regulation of adaptive immunity and mucosal immunity, while many of the genes in S animals are associated with pro-inflammatory interleukins involved with innate and adaptive immunity. These correlated with greater lesion severity and higher MAP numbers in lymph nodes of S animals. By week 50 the number of upregulated genes declined in both groups. A number of genes upregulated in R animals appear to be associated with host resistance and regulation of adaptive immunity, especially CEACAM8. Genes upregulated in S animals involve antigen presentation (ENDOD1) and gut associated immune pathology (HSH2D). In conclusion, gene expression in jejunal lymph nodes of resistant and susceptible deer infer that the resistant phenotype is associated with pathways of adaptive immunity, while susceptibility is linked with upregulated non-protective pro-inflammatory responses, following experimental MAP infection.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Colin G.

b1815d5fe05dc8f00d66e586e6f8a2c6ce750cb6,Analysis of genes related to chlorophyll metabolism under elevated CO2 in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.),"Abstract Cucumber is a vegetable crop with a large area of protected cultivation. The application of CO2 can promote photosynthesis in cucumber and increase yield. However, as an important photosynthetic pigment, and the molecular mechanisms of chlorophyll action are still unclear. It is therefore of great theoretical and practical significance to discover CO2-sensitive genes and analyze metabolic pathways to clarify the mechanisms of promoting photosynthesis by RNA sequencing. In this study, the photosynthetic correlation index and chlorophyll content under elevated CO2 and control conditions were compared. It was found that the application of CO2 expanded the effective light utilization range and promoted the biosynthesis of chlorophyll in cucumber. Seventeen genes related to chlorophyll were discovered in 380 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained by RNA-Seq and they were involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis, chlorophyll-binding protein and chloroplast development. These genes were suggested to be related to increasing photosynthetic rate under enriched CO2 in cucumber.

High PB white blood cell (WBC) counts reflect tumor burden in PB and have been used in the past as a clinical risk factor in ALL. We hypothesized that, given differential microenvironment signaling provided by BM and PB, ALLs with high or low WBC counts (WBChigh and WBClow) might differ with regard to their dependence on the microenvironment. To approach this issue, we investigated gene expression changes in PB blasts as compared to their BM counterparts in patients with precursor B-cell ALL (n=15). Blasts were isolated from BM and PB samples by flow sorting and investigated for mRNA levels using Affymetrix HG U133A microarrays. Gene expression data, normalized by variance stabilization on probe level, were analysed in matched PB-BM pairs using a SAM-like analysis of log ratios in a balanced permutation test. By these procedures, a limited number of 38 genes consistently changed in PB vs BM blasts was identified (false discovery rate",2004,Biology,"list(name = ""Peter Rhein"", ids = ""2184125""); list(name = ""Stefanie Scheid"", ids = ""2179040""); list(name = ""Christian Hagemeier"", ids = ""5018679""); list(name = ""Karl Dr. Seeger"", ids = ""46932169""); list(name = ""Renate Kirschner"", ids = ""152838314""); list(name = ""Martin Schrappe"", ids = ""49944905""); list(name = ""Rainer Spang"", ids = ""48692032""); list(name = ""W. -D.

This study was conducted to identify and validate molecular markers linked to important breeding traits by association mapping. The association was evaluated between 81 molecular markers (STS, SSR, Indel, CAPS, and PCR-based SNP) and 15 morphological traits in a global panel of 100 rice (Oryza sativa) accessions. The population structure analysis identified three main subpopulations. Obvious kinship relationships were also detected between the rice accessions. Association analysis was performed based on the mixed linear model by considering population structure and family relatedness. In addition, the false discovery rate method was used to correct the multiple testing. A total of 47 marker-trait associations were identified, including 22 markers for 14 traits. Among all, the polymorphism at the loci DDR-GL was highly associated with grain characters (grain length, grain width, and length/width ratio). In addition, marker RM3148 was responsible for five important traits simultaneously. Results demonstrated that such informative markers can be very useful for rice breeding programs using marker-assisted selection. Moreover, the diverse populations of rice accessions are a valuable resource for association mapping of morphological traits.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mojtaba Jahani"", ids = ""47636939""); list(name = ""Ghorbanali Nematzadeh"", ids = ""5078572""); list(name = ""Behnaz Dolatabadi"", ids = ""15033148""); list(name = ""Sayyed Hamidreza Hashemi"", ids = ""144665240""); list(name = ""Ghasem Mohammadi-nejad"", ids = ""8027608"")",d0d5d3a1df4714177ef70fd317513d2b93429429; 224e8e7283f6fb51c0ec953d343fddc6a636b542; 628efa1ce39374d99327cda65b7e502363938c9f; f2b2fbf0aa0983cbf36a373b07469d08e1039bb1; 1d34abff502a907f4866f255b6ef008500a24053,,Genome,57 6,"

4c9a5635198a33d32bf0cb9dc335b89cebf7aa25,Screening for membrane proteins differentially expressed between the lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with high- and low-metastatic potential using iTRAQ technology,"Objective: To screen for the membrane proteins differentially expressed between the lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with high- and low- metastatic potential, and to explore the potential targets for biomarkers and biological therapy. Methods: The membrane proteins were extracted from lung adenocarcinoma SPC-A-1 and SPC-A-1 sci cells which were generated from the same parental cell type and had low- and high- metastatic potential, respectively. The membrane proteins were labeled and the peptides were separated and analyzed by iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) technology combined with Nano-LC-MS/MS (nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry). The identification and quantitation of the proteins were analyzed by Proteinpilot 4.0 solfware. The membrane proteins differentially expressed were analyzed and verified by GO (Gene Ontology) terms and real-time fluorescence quantitative-PCR in combination with Western blotting, respectively. Results: The identified numbers of proteins with FDRs (false discovery rates) < 1% were 1 413, 1 374, 1 297, and 1 351 in the experiment which were repeated four times by Nano LC-MS/MS, and the rate of labelling was above 95%. Among the 27 proteins up-regulated in total four experiments, 20 proteins were identified as membrane protein. Among the 32 proteins down-regulated in total four experiments, 25 proteins were identified as membrane protein. The GO analysis demonstrated the major molecular functions of the proteins differentially expressed including cytoskeletal protein binding, identical protein binding and enzyme binding as well as the catabolic process and cellular localization in biological processes. The expression levels of ITGA3 (integrin alpha-3), MYH9 (myosin, heavy chain 9), PLEC1 (plectin 1), HADHA (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase), HK1 (hexokinase-1), KTN1 (kinectin 1), ESYT1 (extended synaptotagmin-like protein 1), ALDH18A1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 18 family, member A1), ATP5A1 (ATP synthase alpha-subunit), LMNB2 (lamin-B2), CAV1 (caveolin-1) and CK-19 (keratin, type â…  cytoskeletal 19) mRNAs in SPC-A-1 sci cells were higher than those in the SPC-A-1 cells. The expression levels of CLTC (clathrin, heavy chain), HK1, LMNB2 and CK-19 in SPC-A-1 sci cells were also higher than those in SPC-A-1 cells. These results were consistent with those from quantitative mass spectrometry. Conclusion: A high-throughput screen for metastasis-related membrane proteins can be performed by a combined use of iTRAQ and Nano LC-MS/MS and may provide the potential metastasis-related biomarkers and therapeutic targets in diagnosis, prognostic prediction and treatment for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

676aa14e0d7ec21b5544b9da671f871159a51c60,Data mining in genomics.,"This article reviews important emerging statistical concepts, data mining techniques, and applications that have been recently developed and used for genomic data analysis. First, general background and some critical issues in genomic data mining are summarized. A novel concept of statistical significance is described, the so-called ""false discovery rate""-the rate of false-positives among all positive findings-which has been suggested to control the error rate of numerous false-positives in large screening biological data analysis. Two recent statistical testing methods are then introduced: significance analysis of microarray and local pooled error tests. Statistical modeling in genomic data analysis is then presented, such as analysis of variance and heterogeneous error modeling approaches that have been suggested for analyzing microarray data obtained from multiple experimental or biological conditions. Two sections then describe data exploration and discovery tools largely termed as supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The former approaches include several multivariate statistical methods to investigate coexpression patterns of multiple genes, and the latter are the classification methods to discover genomic biomarker signatures for predicting important subclasses of human diseases.

4b6561204398745c0b1cd289764f97f804877824,Genetic overlap between birthweight and adult cardiometabolic diseases has implications for genomic medicine,"Before implementing therapeutic genomic interventions for optimizing health in early life, comprehensive understanding of their effect on several traits across the life course is warranted. AbnormlÂ  birthweight is associated with cardiometabolic disease risk in adulthood; however, the extent of genetic pleiotropy in the association has not been comprehensively investigated. We tested for pleiotropy and enrichment of functional loci between birthweight and 15 cardiometabolic disease traits (CMD). We found significantly abundant genetic pleiotropy (Pâ€‰<â€‰3.3â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’3) and enrichment of functional annotations (Pâ€‰<â€‰3.3â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’3) in loci influencing both birthweight and CMD. We did not observe consistent effect directions of pleiotropic loci on the traits. A total of 67 genetic loci, of which 65 loci have been reported in previous genome-wide association studies, were associated with both birthweight and CMD at a false discovery rate of 5%. Two novel loci were associated with birthweight and adult coronary artery disease (rs2870463 in CTRB1) and with birthweight and adult waist circumference (rs12704673 in CALCR). Both loci are known to have regulatory effects on expression of nearby genes. In all, our findings revealed pervasive genetic pleiotropy in early growth and adulthood cardiometabolic diseases, implying the need for caution when considering genetic loci as therapeutic targets.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Fasil Tekola-Ayele"", ids = ""1398789008""); list(name = ""Anthony Lee"", ids = ""98892510""); list(name = ""Tsegaselassie Workalemahu"", ids = ""6469256""); list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""47528090""); list(name = ""Deepika Shrestha"", ids = ""15642849""); list(name = ""Azmeraw T.

Due to these advances, the development of software tools for large-scale, fully automated, unambiguous peptide identification is highly necessary. In this work, we have used as a model the nuclear proteome from Jurkat cells and present a processing algorithm that allows accurate predictions of random matching distributions, based on the two SEQUEST scores Xcorr and DeltaCn. Our method permits a very simple and precise calculation of the probabilities associated with individual peptide assignments, as well as of the false discovery rate among the peptides identified in any experiment. A further mathematical analysis demonstrates that the score distributions are highly dependent on database size and precursor mass window and suggests that the probability associated with SEQUEST scores depends on the number of candidate peptide sequences available for the search. Our results highlight the importance of adjusting the filtering criteria to discriminate between correct and incorrect peptide sequences according to the circumstances of each particular experiment.",2004,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Daniel Lopez-Ferrer"", ids = ""1401634554""); list(name = ""Salvador MartÃ­nez-BartolomÃ©"", ids = ""1401305323""); list(name = ""Margarita Villar"", ids = ""2925466""); list(name = ""Monica Campillos"", ids = ""2329572""); list(name = ""Fernando MartÃ­n-Maroto"", ids = ""1401645281""); list(name = ""JesÃºs VÃ¡zquez"", ids = ""144727873"")",536b7d86ba23220e44e3fef6089a84069e1f477c; bad49d3d29f85f9a8fdfa65efbcb4d2228901c8b; e8435eed9da4de433d82a5c392fd494bad4e14a3; 013f2c9c6362e58bc6cd34850c3b55ab344eaedc; 9ced21b88a0c38286cd2d3615d43caec2c145b54; 1f7b2333ef4231dc1ac8311358c8d49800809756; 0c87e3ba0b43e27afae9180f4faa83f1dc403914; 74dad632956a41839cc21ef47f14130e3453a09e; 54cd31fcb3ae4aa7b6d5242103d54466bd550f23; aaaa91e6dc896eb36cb23a21a40dca087a3ddb57; d6e7ffe10b0ac5f042e8cf4891786d8b6c3a9eef; de7d913187cb94854cd5b44ff21530d431c26397; 5d32703bf686df7889386248e6f46a0c4a0b6c8e; 64358ca8b1c7696d20faf8030334df17887a8e23; e7efccfabb3f21c9836c9be8ba397e547a01b078; a87d43b5d4902ec4831556497ccd1587ec3dae30; 5ef7df3421a367cb339770b524a35ba4deaac9c6; a380161af0d41f413040859bfa0a24aa68dc3fc0; 3e1ebd768ae1882d963e77fd7a395514cd556d16; 99f3b64a6c909676ba4abdc833fc18c1595ffd00; 2db4184a9defac27c39a10703254c7285c53cd42; bfaf760ed0ac82fd9b8150aaf30841ece4698e77; 81b294f474ba20a44e4b29c932f9987e4376da5a; eccd7a3d34810fd7ee8febdec735cb79023aabcd; 84e1aa17d2f19c123bc937f344d4785800d5aa49; d344456a53353f690ca5bc5caec6aaae03e8f291; d454a87a98aa0be437a660e408cefa1ac0a68aae; 98a7be665eb27e98fd3fb6cb41ecce7f0a74007e; e8b24c3ffacc6cee3aeaa9f2c6166567abd9bfb4; 195c565b0300a5491d86026cfa896cd5588f5a9c; 044212a2e39d66fcc852ef78b9dae5cd56de6a98; 777fbc75561a0afc28a26ecb98d15e789fbef115; 61458fb535aef4009b4b29b21871c1ade0d092b6; 72884d25a6c1689d84c5db7744d057c2bda62ca7; cdd7b720bea79d06a69815bb45663b8c16f19c6f; 82a26e7c82bddd32d8dab5d06aec8c1a9bdb1b06; 26a4001994d2099f8eed980780063a97ed8cb11c; 2022c0e05325443f0005d3a318e53e22323e4b80; cf7c13fc9940649965c549099b949d86e49fa4d5; 924c0db7fda3d12da090d06a94d4f49012eaeb06; 3e2589785139ea126722e5c379c7976f68d22983; 47f5297908bcc3abe8db49df2e18947d65734e3f; 1f39534bcc3387d78996f9c54385060974e50f85; ce0051f3293d7668c6199fa34118ee1301c638d8; 96f9f7ddce258fc85e3b1532b7471e2c4c640fd7; b9dffb82bf70fb36b78b42e34d284c46d7a8a1f7; 12d800235f1a0a2c019daa4d3022694285f856ff,,Analytical chemistry,76 23,"

defaec95a0b04ccd2cdf897df92316e6d013855d,THU0013 Downregulation of microrna may contribute to activation of the interferon signalling pathway in the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies,"Background The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a group of rare autoimmune conditions characterised by weakness and inflammation of skeletal muscle. MicroRNA are short single stranded RNA which regulate gene expression by binding to particular target mRNA and suppressing translation or inducing degradation. MicroRNA are known to play a role in muscle homeostasis and immune regulation and therefore may be involved in IIM pathology. Objectives To profile both microRNA and mRNA in whole blood samples from polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM) and inclusion body myositis (IBM) patients compared to non-myositis controls using next generation RNA sequencing. Methods Whole blood samples in tempus tubes were collected as part of the myositis research tissue bank held at the University of Manchester. Total RNA was extracted from 7 PM, 7â€‰DM, 5 IBM and 5 non-myositis control samples and both microRNA and mRNA profiles were determined by sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 4000. Results Analysis of microRNA expression identified 19 microRNAs as significantly differentially expressed (DE) (p Gene expression analysis identified 129 significantly DE genes for PM (false discovery rate Conclusions To our knowledge this is the first mRNA and microRNA profiling study in whole blood from myositis patients using RNA sequencing. Grouping by anti-Jo1 positivity identified different microRNA and increased predicted activation of interferon signalling compared to the clinical subgroups analysed. Our results suggest that increased activation of the interferon pathway in anti-Jo1 positive patients may be due to downregulation of microRNAs which target genes in this pathway.

538d72d4a35dc849e6e488260b841b31af1db579,Differential expression profile analysis of DNA damage repair genes in CD133+/CD133- colorectal cancer cells.,"The present study examined differential expression levels of DNA damage repair genes in COLO 205 colorectal cancer cells, with the aim of identifying novel biomarkers for the molecular diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. COLO 205-derived cell spheres were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with cell factors, and CD133+/CD133- cells were subsequently sorted using an indirect CD133 microbead kit. In vitro differentiation and tumorigenicity assays in BABA/c nude mice were performed to determine whether the CD133+ cells also possessed stem cell characteristics, in addition to the COLO 205 and CD133- cells. RNA sequencing was employed for the analysis of differential gene expression levels at the mRNA level, which was determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The mRNA expression levels of 43 genes varied in all three types of colon cancer cells (false discovery rate â‰¤0.05; fold change â‰¥2). Of these 43 genes, 30 were differentially expressed (8 upregulated and 22 downregulated) in the COLO 205 cells, as compared with the CD133- cells, and 6 genes (all downregulated) were differentially expressed in the COLO 205 cells, as compared with CD133+ cells. A total of 18 genes (10 upregulated and 8 downregulated) were differentially expressed in the CD133- cells, as compared with the CD133+ cells. By contrast, 6 genes were downregulated and none were upregulated in the CD133+ cells compared with the COLO 205 cells. These findings suggest that CD133+ cells may possess the same DNA repair capacity as COLO 205 cells. Heterogeneity in the expression profile of DNA damage repair genes was observed in COLO 205 cells, and COLO 205-derived CD133- cells and CD133+ cells may therefore provide a reference for molecular diagnosis, therapeutic target selection and determination of the treatment and prognosis for colorectal cancer.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yuhong Lu"", ids = ""6789160""); list(name = ""Xin Zhou"", ids = ""145247531""); list(name = ""Qingliang Zeng"", ids = ""46899945""); list(name = ""Daishun Liu"", ids = ""7416042""); list(name = ""Changwu Yue"", ids = ""34697006"")",,1d028c8d0c4b278c7ffae369d4df565f5a1d9002; fabcae131f4027dd452539b8de62088e681ca7b5; 74ef095c713541eff598c6f8580e7c80423cea05; 4e538bd0f4d9f2290c23cbecbd956a293daf3057; 1c280e9f1b5a5fec6f985550fd99e8ae6157387a; d4c3a3a4015393db41c7709a54598dc0948e59b9; e10c62312bab3cc523711b13ffa54a7d0c5781ad; 1148e1a153e15df7a3dd77b2da473be014736097; fb4960f7d66aced0e6ed8009b20166654e658a2f; 5adfa4e4a3e0731bd81f0cb399c073aa923b799d; be1033457132ec1617a5bc05a4864e4b7600dbdb; 1b69034a4cf628ff0b99063d9d4c46592a74fb89; c2c2adaa8f34f08890e4130ee9980079a1186035; 7e04afee04fed3687590c7811ad736da89a55a2d; ac33d9ab002ebdd5772f92415d8b872fb02d0275; 5765447247637fe595c04620096125934c125bc1; c6a6227a12b09df629498899da07f4d0dade9d50; 2ad6976547f27aefb8cf5104d33a62ff06ee352d; 137f87c357c8496a3a9de4dc60a110bdfe8557b2; e9668976011e8ed2e50c5ab9210960ca0124efae; 41b8165c0f2c80185a926c5ef8adf6459bf2402d; f1d265fc1f94734151fa9d1db7f5791603ca9a8f; a4ff83e4bbdfe80c55e008f4d3a1a731f19c29ea; 140aac8ee61529285021269b8f807a8ceeb218e4; ace21282063787cd5d4eb8248ac51b9670a31f79; 8795688c5664093940c40a804031346f1f6ce291; db855a1ba4d5d898fc12968dbe319c3873ce053d; ae3078239fb77abc8d4c8374183d65328aa6f350; cc94821941baa7a082ceb0b7b54c2b9435d1a389; 96ff93cd115ed256f78083106a1446f402d7f344; 0b3d5ce0a984f49926ba939373c27bd3e3c1cf71; dfc618bef007e0af3f4ebefe27a8fdb802d0da3d; 8b1d8731b4d820074e652ea0ba31f6dc381aa71f; 7a949ae9374bdc7474c05d80b4a0eade35192256; aa01c119bb0b2b471fb7ca8ea6f0f1889fcf847f; 374313d78ef33325bcbeecd574901e225df644bd; b2d859279f087d0ba53ccc0876b0656ba068e117; a0eaa9427d008a582b55964de42580ff26cf16e9; 29a5e8feb903368c5db203073d530a9180d4b62d; 5385a4847b039ee340bf48b84ef9daefbc0fa0ba; 47ef0233f7c84151ad410a9cad7250dcf903b4ee; d35d70dadfe87383d3d6858396f2075973a55386; 98fa2dc46fde3d244c292944ed1ed32025bb0de6; b38abafe2fd68d24b374b134db58e5c8e95afc7d; 2b9bf0d01ef884630515161b38f0daf8bb5a5302; 01235137984d0e397a52e5d4a1367eb8e4143d10; 2a47e7027a374ae59d0513bc92afee7a343c760d; 4eada19ab89300025e800e865c342f45dddb5904; 68f069781e341b66e58eb61edcce0f6a0c735b0d; acd1878c96a671467230a0ef25ff0c7b7e1226e3; d798802ca723ed65a7b51e90fa578e6663be1178; 9e2fd1727ad781ba448906cf61429e97cf4bb660; ec10e3c10553a59136312a41656182411d3c53a1; 2a62095276242a166b2e4715c6702a9769645248; 90c34196579f93e83b42cff537080ecb9664e61f; f7dcb8680b140e32d9fc96b0136d1a133281adec; 5b1ab0e2a8eeb2715aa898ab08bf8628c8cf7e6e; 0ff4485a3b84918f4521c809509aa517d89ce965; da807907df75b0ee6baaf9c7690d6d925ba3cd2b; b68cabdd31022ca2a8356b45e9777a10ac6096cf; 5bde0e2eeb6f3db5faa2594198aee09a9185e9e5,Oncology letters,14 2,"

0feed5842bf35058d9aef69da8c041d568446be9,Identification of gene expression profiles predicting tumor cell response to L-alanosine.,"The methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) gene gained considerable interest as therapeutic target for tumors with the 9p21 deletion. This gene maps to 9p21 and loss of this chromosomal region in tumors offers an unique opportunity for chemoselective treatment, since MTAP is an important salvage enzyme for the formation of adenine that is needed for DNA synthesis. L-Alanosine, an antibiotic from Streptomyces alanosinicus, blocks the common de novo purine biosynthesis pathway and, thereby, inhibits tumor cells with MTAP deficiency. Normal cells escape the detrimental effects of L-alanosine due to their proficiency in the MTAP salvage pathway. The present analysis was undertaken to gain insights into the molecular architecture of tumor cells that determines the response to L-alanosine apart from the MTAP gene. Analysis of cell doubling times and IC(50) values for L-alanosine showed that slowly growing cell lines were more resistant to L-alanosine than rapidly growing ones. Mining the database of the National Cancer Institute (N.C.I.), for the mRNA expression of 9706 genes in 60 cell lines by means of Kendall's tau-test, false discovery rate calculation, and hierarchical cluster analysis pointed to 11 genes or expressed sequence tags whose mRNA expression correlated with the IC(50) values for L-alanosine. Furthermore, we tested L-alanosine for cross-resistance in multidrug-resistant cell lines which overexpress selectively either the P-glycoprotein/MDR1 (CEM/ADR5000), MRP1 (HL-60/AR), or BCRP (MDA-MB-231-BCRP) genes. None of the multidrug-resistant cell lines was cross-resistant to L-alanosine indicating that L-alanosine may be suitable to treat multidrug-resistant, refractory tumors in the clinic. Finally, the IC(50) values for L-alanosine of the 60 cell lines were correlated to the p53 mutational status and expression of p53 downstream genes. We found that p53 mutated cell lines were more resistant to L-alanosine than p53 wild type cell lines.",2003,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Thomas Efferth"", ids = ""3131602""); list(name = ""Erich Gebhart"", ids = ""3593514""); list(name = ""Douglas D.

46fc4158dd405f4d28d79cbc193fbbcda5041380,Cord Blood Metabolic Signatures of Birth Weight: A Population-Based Study.,"Birth weight is an important indicator of maternal and fetal health and a predictor of health in later life. However, the determinants of variance in birth weight are still poorly understood. We aimed to identify the biological pathways, which may be perturbed by environmental exposures, that are important in determining birth weight. We applied untargeted mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics to 481 cord blood samples collected at delivery in four birth cohorts from across Europe: ENVIRONAGE (Belgium), INMA (Spain), Piccolipiu (Italy), and Rhea (Greece). We performed a metabolome-wide association scan for birth weight on over 4000 metabolic features, controlling the false discovery rate at 5%. Annotation of compounds was conducted through reference to authentic standards. We identified 68 metabolites significantly associated with birth weight, including vitamin A, progesterone, docosahexaenoic acid, indolelactic acid, and multiple acylcarnitines and phosphatidylcholines. We observed enrichment (p < 0.05) of the tryptophan metabolism, prostaglandin formation, C21-steroid hormone signaling, carnitine shuttle, and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways. Vitamin A was associated with both maternal smoking and birth weight, suggesting a mediation pathway. Our findings shed new light on the pathways central to fetal growth and will have implications for antenatal and perinatal care and potentially for health in later life.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Oliver Robinson"", ids = ""144538171""); list(name = ""Pekka Keski-Rahkonen"", ids = ""1398764145""); list(name = ""Leda Chatzi"", ids = ""5655606""); list(name = ""Manolis Kogevinas"", ids = ""134417153""); list(name = ""Tim S.

86bd99b238c2c3a7f9ab52d00795826a8b71be92,Abstract A50: Mitochondrial metabolism gene variants are associated with risk and survival in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC),"Background: Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) is a lethal gynecologic malignancy. Mitochondria are cellular organelles that regulate energy metabolism and are the primary source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage both the nuclear and mitochondria DNA (mtDNA), contributing to the pathogenesis of EOC. Previously, we identified statistically significant EOC risk associations with 54 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 11 mitochondria-related genes in a study of 1815 EOC cases and 1900 controls. In this replication study we expand our investigation of mitochondrial metabolism genetic variants and associations with EOC risk and overall survival (OS). Methods: In a discovery set of 3761 EOC cases and 2722 controls, we investigated risk associations in 4200 SNPs from 130 mitochondrial metabolism genes. We genotyped 431 of the most significant SNPs from 86 genes in 14,525 EOC cases and 23,447 controls (of European ancestry) from 43 studies in OCAC using an Illumina Infinium iSelect BeadChip. Risk analyses were conducted using unconditional logistic regression under a log-additive model and adjusted for study site and the first five principal components of population substructure. Both invasive cancers combined and the four main histological subtypes were analyzed. Survival analyses were conducted on the same SNPs using Cox hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs considering overall survival in 10,084 cases from 28 OCAC studies. We adjusted for multiple tests using False Discovery Rate q Results: The strongest evidence of an association for risk of invasive cancers combined and the serous subtype was SNP rs3096 in the pyridoxamine 59-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) gene (OR=1.08, p=2.8x10-6). In clear cell carcinoma, the strongest association was a missense coding SNP rs28379632 (Ile421Met) in the MT-CYB gene (OR=4.0, p=0.003). For endometrioid cancer rs9330440 in the UNQ6494 gene was most significant (OR=0.89, p=0.001) while rs10267797 in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) gene was most significant in the mucinous subtype (OR=1.15, p=0.004). The strongest association with overall survival was mitochondrial transcription termination factor 1 (MTERF) rs2540571 (HR=0.92, p= 0.00011). Conclusion: These results suggest that mitochondrial metabolism gene variants appear to be associated with EOC risk and survival.

2aec680b47e28f07d828d601bc2ee30a16431551,Comparison of Microarray Pre-Processing Methods,"Data pre-processing in microarray technology is a crucial initial step before data analysis is performed. Many pre-processing methods have been proposed but none has proved ideal to date. Frequently, datasets are limited by laboratory constraints so that the need is for guidelines on quality and robustness, to inform further experimentation while data are yet restricted. In this paper, we compared the performance of 4 popular methods, namely MAS5, Li & Wong pmonly (LWPM), Li & Wong subtractMM (LWMM) and RMA. The comparison is based on analysis carried out on sets of laboratory-generated data from the Bioinformatics Lab, National Institute of Cellular Biotechnology (NICB), Dublin City University, Ireland. These experiments were designed to examine the effect of Bromodeoxyuridine (5bromo-2-deoxyuridine, BrdU) treatment in deep lamellar keratoplasty (DLKP) cells. The methodology employed is to assess dispersion across the replicates and analyze the false discovery rate. From the dispersion analysis, we found that variability is reduced more effectively by LWPM and RMA methods. From the false positive analysis, and for both parametric and non-parametric approaches, LWMM is found to perform best. Based on a complementary q-value analysis, LWMM approach again is the strongest candidate. The indications are that, while LWMM is marginally less effective than LWPM and RMA in terms of variance reduction, it has considerably improved discrimination overall.",2009,,"list(name = ""Kiran Shakya"", ids = ""39904905""); list(name = ""Heather J.

f6ee92d0ce24903abe17addc422d25e32c353db8,Streaming FDR Calculation for Protein Identification,"Identification of proteins is a key step of metaproteomics research. This protein identification task should be migrated to a fast data streaming architecture to increase horizontal scalability and performance. A protein database search involves two steps: the pairwise matching of experimental spectra against protein sequences creating peptide-spectrum-matches (PSM) and the statistical validation of PSMs. The peptide-spectrum-matching is inherently parallelizable since each match is independent. However, false positive matches are inherent to this method due to measurement errors and artifacts, thus requiring statistical validation. State of the art validation is achieved using the target-decoy method, which estimates the false discovery rate (FDR) by searching against a shuffled version of the original protein database. In contrast to the protein database search, validation by target-decoy is not parallelizable, because the FDR approximation requires all experimental data at once. In short, when using a fast data architecture for the workflow, the target-decoy approach is no longer feasible. Hence a novel approach is required to avoid false discovery of PSM on streaming single-pass experimental data. To this end, the recently proposed nokoi classifier seems promising to solve the aforementioned problems.

Though microbial community profiling methods have emerged to attempt to rapidly classify the millions of reads output from contemporary sequencers, the combination of incomplete databases, similarity among otherwise divergent genomes, and the large volumes of sequencing data required for metagenome sequencing has led to unacceptably high false discovery rates (FDR). Here we present the application of a novel, gene-independent and signature-based metagenomic taxonomic profiling tool with significantly smaller FDR, which is also capable of classifying never-before seen genomes into the appropriate parent taxa.The algorithm is based upon three primary computational phases: (I) genomic decomposition into bit vectors, (II) bit vector intersections to identify shared regions, and (III) bit vector subtractions to remove shared regions and reveal unique, signature regions. In the Decomposition phase, genomic data is first masked to highlight only the valid (non-ambiguous) regions and then decomposed into overlapping 24-mers. The k-mers are sorted along with their start positions, de-replicated, and then prefixed, to minimize data duplication. The prefixes are indexed and an identical data structure is created for the start positions moreÂ Â» to mimic that of the k-mer data structure. During the Intersection phase -- which is the most computationally intensive phase -- as an all-vs-all comparison is made, the number of comparisons is first reduced by four methods: (a) Prefix restriction, (b) Overlap detection, (c) Overlap restriction, and (d) Result recording. In Prefix restriction, only k-mers of the same prefix are compared. Within that group, potential overlap of k-mer suffixes that would result in a non-empty set intersection are screened for. If such an overlap exists, the region which intersects is first reduced by performing a binary search of the boundary suffixes of the smaller set into the larger set, which defines the limits of the zipper-based intersection process. Rather than recording the actual k-mers of the intersection, another data structure of identical ""shape"" is created which consists of only bit vectors so that only a 1 or 0 will be stored in the location of the k-mer suffix that was found in the intersection. This reduces the amount of data generated and stored considerably. During the Subtraction phase, relevant intersection bitmasks are first unionized together to form a single bitmask which is then applied over the original genome to reveal only those regions of the genome that are unique. These regions are then exported to disk in FASTA format and used in the application of determining the constituents of an unknown metagenomic community.

9055dff3199a5af0c92d551964a897605f768c99,A critical review of the first 10 years of candidate gene-by-environment interaction research in psychiatry.,"OBJECTIVE
Gene-by-environment interaction (GÃ—E) studies in psychiatry have typically been conducted using a candidate GÃ—E (cGÃ—E) approach, analogous to the candidate gene association approach used to test genetic main effects. Such cGÃ—E research has received widespread attention and acclaim, yet cGÃ—E findings remain controversial. The authors examined whether the many positive cGÃ—E findings reported in the psychiatric literature were robust or if, in aggregate, cGÃ—E findings were consistent with the existence of publication bias, low statistical power, and a high false discovery rate.


METHOD
The authors conducted analyses on data extracted from all published studies (103 studies) from the first decade (2000-2009) of cGÃ—E research in psychiatry.


RESULTS
Ninety-six percent of novel cGÃ—E studies were significant compared with 27% of replication attempts. These findings are consistent with the existence of publication bias among novel cGÃ—E studies, making cGÃ—E hypotheses appear more robust than they actually are. There also appears to be publication bias among replication attempts because positive replication attempts had smaller average sample sizes than negative ones. Power calculations using observed sample sizes suggest that cGÃ—E studies are underpowered. Low power along with the likely low prior probability of a given cGÃ—E hypothesis being true suggests that most or even all positive cGÃ—E findings represent type I errors.


CONCLUSIONS
In this new era of big data and small effects, a recalibration of views about groundbreaking findings is necessary. Well-powered direct replications deserve more attention than novel cGÃ—E findings and indirect replications.",2011,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Laramie E.

bafeac77fdea940b4ad20a0075de636023cbdd20,Changes in DNA methylation from pre- to post-adolescence are associated with pubertal exposures,"BackgroundAdolescence is a period characterized by major biological development, which may be associated with changes in DNA methylation (DNA-M). However, it is unknown to what extent DNA-M varies from pre- to post-adolescence, whether the pattern of changes is different between females and males, and how adolescence-related factors are associated with changes in DNA-M.MethodsGenome-scale DNA-M at ages 10 and 18â€‰years in whole blood of 325 subjects (n = 140 females) in the Isle of Wight (IOW) birth cohort was analyzed using Illumina Infinium arrays (450K and EPIC). Linear mixed models were used to examine DNA-M changes between pre- and post-adolescence and whether the changes were gender-specific. Adolescence-related factors and environmental exposure factors were assessed on their association with DNA-M changes. Replication of findings was attempted in the comparable Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort.ResultsIn the IOW cohort, after controlling for technical variation and cell compositions at both pre- and post-adolescence, 15,532 cytosineâ€“phosphateâ€“guanine (CpG) sites (of 400,825 CpGs, 3.88%) showed statistically significant DNA-M changes from pre-adolescence to post-adolescence invariant to gender (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.05). Of these 15,532 CpGs, 10,212 CpGs (66%) were replicated in the ALSPAC cohort. Pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified significant biological pathways related to growth and development of the reproductive system, emphasizing the importance of this period of transition on epigenetic state of genes. In addition, in IOW, we identified 1179 CpGs with gender-specific DNA-M changes. In the IOW cohort, body mass index (BMI) at age 10â€‰years, age of growth spurt, nonsteroidal drugs use, and current smoking status showed statistically significant associations with DNA-M changes at 15 CpGs on 14 genes such as the AHRR gene. For BMI at age 10â€‰years, the association was gender-specific. Findings on current smoking status were replicated in the ALSPAC cohort.ConclusionAdolescent transition is associated with changes in DNA-M at more than 15K CpGs. Identified pathways emphasize the importance of this period of transition on epigenetic state of genes relevant to cell growth and immune system development.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Luhang Han"", ids = ""1439440333""); list(name = ""Hongmei Zhang"", ids = ""49723900""); list(name = ""Akhilesh Kaushal"", ids = ""3833475""); list(name = ""Faisal I.

1d1bda5449ae9a609ed7ed6ed87e425084425862,Clinical proteomics in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Investigation of the human specimens is an essential element for understanding the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. The studies hold promise for identifying biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, elucidating disease mechanisms, and accelerating the development of new strategies for therapeutic intervention. Here, we review proteomics studies of human brain samples in light of recent advances of mass spectrometry, focusing on the general strategies for experimental design and analysis (e.g., sample pooling and replication, selection of proteomics platforms, and false discovery rate in data processing), because quantitative analysis of clinical samples is confounded by a number of variables, including genetic differences, antemortem and postmortem factors, and experimental errors. Diverse proteomics platforms are also discussed with respect to sensitivity, throughput, and accuracy. Regarding the enormous complexity of the human brain and the limitation of current proteomics technologies, it may be more practical to analyze a subset of proteome in a functional context, in order to facilitate the identification of important disease-related proteins in the substantial noise reflecting biological and technical variances.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jian-ying Zhou"", ids = ""114157305""); list(name = ""John J.

ce982b5a50b0d84e5e6f9a00df14ac2128354e32,Genetic architecture of human plasma lipidome and its link to cardiovascular disease,"Understanding genetic architecture of plasma lipidome could provide better insights into lipid metabolism and its link to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Here, we perform genome-wide association analyses of 141 lipid species (nâ€‰=â€‰2,181 individuals), followed by phenome-wide scans with 25 CVD related phenotypes (nâ€‰=â€‰511,700 individuals). We identify 35 lipid-species-associated loci (Pâ€‰<5â€‰Ã—10âˆ’8), 10 of which associate with CVD risk including five new loci-COL5A1, GLTPD2, SPTLC3, MBOAT7 and GALNT16 (false discovery rate<0.05). We identify loci for lipid species that are shown to predict CVD e.g., SPTLC3 for CER(d18:1/24:1). We show that lipoprotein lipase (LPL) may more efficiently hydrolyze medium length triacylglycerides (TAGs) than others. Polyunsaturated lipids have highest heritability and genetic correlations, suggesting considerable genetic regulation at fatty acids levels. We find low genetic correlations between traditional lipids and lipid species. Our results show that lipidomic profiles capture information beyond traditional lipids and identify genetic variants modifying lipid levels and risk of CVD. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are associated with plasma lipid levels. Here, Tabassum et al. perform genome-wide association studies for lipidomic profiles with 141 (non-standard) lipid species which highlights shared genetic loci with CVD and that traditional lipids have low genetic correlation with other lipids.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Rubina Tabassum"", ids = ""2754702""); list(name = ""Joel T.

2cc3ff2bd76fe01968cf4cc633df5180b10df0b6,Maternal depression is associated with DNA methylation changes in cord blood T lymphocytes and adult hippocampi,"Depression affects 10â€“15% of pregnant women and has been associated with preterm delivery and later developmental, behavioural and learning disabilities. We tested the hypothesis that maternal depression is associated with DNA methylation alterations in maternal T lymphocytes, neonatal cord blood T lymphocytes and adult offspring hippocampi. Genome-wide DNA methylation of CD3+ T lymphocytes isolated from 38 antepartum maternal and 44 neonatal cord blood samples were analyzed using Illumina Methylation 450â€‰K microarrays. Previously obtained methylation data sets using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and array-hybridization of 62 postmortem hippocampal samples of adult males were re-analyzed to test associations with history of maternal depression. We found 145 (false discovery rate (FDR) q<0.05) and 2520 (FDR q<0.1) differentially methylated CG-sites in cord blood T lymphocytes of neonates from the maternal depression group as compared with the control group. However, no significant DNA methylation differences were detected in the antepartum maternal T lymphocytes of our preliminary data set. We also detected 294 differentially methylated probes (FDR q<0.1) in hippocampal samples associated with history of maternal depression. We observed a significant overlap (P=0.002) of 33 genes with changes in DNA methylation in T lymphocytes of neonates and brains of adult offspring. Many of these genes are involved in immune system functions. Our results show that DNA methylation changes in offspring associated with maternal depression are detectable at birth in the immune system and persist to adulthood in the brain. This is consistent with the hypothesis that system-wide epigenetic changes are involved in life-long responses to maternal depression in the offspring.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Zsofia Nemoda"", ids = ""3800943""); list(name = ""Renaud Massart"", ids = ""6723050""); list(name = ""Matt Suderman"", ids = ""153618821""); list(name = ""Miranda Cady Hallett"", ids = ""50658247""); list(name = ""Tianchen Li"", ids = ""40698477""); list(name = ""Margaret Coote"", ids = ""4354458""); list(name = ""Nicholas Cody"", ids = ""46568804""); list(name = ""Zeng Shou Sun"", ids = ""9145884""); list(name = ""Claudio N Soares"", ids = ""1756553""); list(name = ""Gustavo Turecki"", ids = ""3785195""); list(name = ""Mc Steiner"", ids = ""153520256""); list(name = ""Moshe Szyf"", ids = ""3870022"")",19d05e6fcb2572ee0bf67e5ecd0795f13633bc64; e69e7abeb30159bedef64270f985dddef004d85b; 794071798897b4462bc343b9cc9d6d6496cf755d; 78ee95345f265bdc55bcf97eec7ab49a7859d567; 0d25acd2422e83d90481a5b2b799ceb071458031; 75d58f21e1a30a54f95b6ef80a797a947b398611; dddd51fe2c87d02c62e9f1e85b36ce547c884645; eee5fd761b9ab757a977b8248460c799e2f1613e; 1c1e24b69f15790e89b05ceb6f6667e4591105ff; 8de4b1b46038a2902d7eba7ec5ee58f124326282; 3f0cf74097f88e2145efb28a6ac61ff9013a512c; c4cb250047cb4c8b9f89901e4c95b1ce3d05ddf9; f0d69f548e0bdbac73cebf8fec2230fb397cd605; 53d88117a367dd1d7d3b0aecb6869cedeccfe431; c8828bdfce696e90866086682565ec29672ef9cd; 6359645538933f44c398761a30f6ed6fced4408f; 7a8f3e4cffea80f5952b68d3863188c6ca244c4e; 829be2be1ffbed004386ce0e7d60edf44eb1fc12; ff35624caee55e5818f6c7cb6947b500f1b60a29; ed83e219bd6e23d00a4d2f2d46375dc6646a3319; 529d212dca515150ae15d47b8742c8911a3f6ae0; 4c7b3cdea95218eece8cab3564875aa4fc0384d1; 1760f2876c49af305b816cf2eb066b00b23a5180; fe9d2bb63fed0ecab5d450a6543910802783421d; 0a59ae505255ebdf6183ffea6d796142167b2833; 81888ac118be84e85b27abd403b3d04973970e11; d8be08230190bf3243cb90905e27bc6dc2125302; a80b77a8a3c3d8f2ad3aa64ec0a224f22bea8978; 2c1a5b703fa58ed6a7fc4662d6f4d96808fd68f8; e15945f72e8f5ac93ba5351b03ddaa7968b11d2c; f2c41705e36e0279b8e7dfd064ce663b36c33ac6; 37ed5584c97318cd1661fc44c1c41602a8a79eb2; 3dad8b05e12e2190962af60017fa3357810cd65b; 4c6c9394e48cccf4593d8f840d9ee592a75cdd02; ee4deb1f5e6f8f6604e85b60ba8f2793d751fa82; ac208e2380ae9bf6bf482d381b8b1af4608054b0; b4a7ede96b577c012e4386fa3bedc6820212cfda; ce3b9ff15407263870ac5f2aba85650b7fbe8313; fd8bb80762f98ad4fd0a814c4b5033a3d62afd1c; 5432bc6830cd5a02673bdb5d08c5d72298972720; 8846091a1b3a4e9170ff572e98139c99620c2e6f; 31fe479d7e5329fd67a0004de19dd99507d61687; ba5ebdc12805d9edb5994a3bb399c128e931ed2b; 5a331be1d8e73498f9e9fc1c0a29b3d994530686; b7c970e1b62ac8563bde4f19a06ead5ef9ba5246; 3c48be3ccd9bc0d1916dcc35c0e1ef5108a94a9f; 6692e708d6c0fc75c595a023d7ae4f92b133e073; 8e475f26953aa6ebbe2fc6c0fdd23a0cc9c4aa64,a066276773e7985daaf47ca9a3959880c613b514; afa250f9a1af4984ecfbe89f91dd61fa8ab1ab1d; 213d58ac0aea19361c4a36a2cb9b343a78de89e2; 2de08480ac32f5b22e33328941ca834995f7ef92; afe663c963c8abed454b4e062f4111b3df271377; 1eeb81e09c461079ea491c91bf422b39896e5f7f; e531b9821e39c1e1aa2df1641774ba31af736913; eedb98e29fa69764ba4f1fb093e6f12e603863f1; 0dc49a6c560d22003eac7c4b7ac4a309f46bba7d; ec7f4fffee56f7acb1607720d117b531525b0713; 7ec69500bff209f67087ad5cd124e6164e86df44; 67a4f670883d8c682b433418203fee4afc7a97ec; f62c9a7e6f4b6cc9b503557f167c88ba6bebd7d0; f5da327a7e3daefaf6d2817c784c20a95cf24819; 20a567e86321cc5202cbb487d32c5baaf6639d35; 31ff18445ed4836640b4db07fdb6be181ba4005e; 82784b1646ccc6d84d4feb73f23f23470238388b; 56043f9e94278cf628acb5f193ac9b2c22ee44e7; aa309a3c6502ff17a4fcffdf669d0a72de2d395d; 9bfedb65c362d56da5d1a0fd6388ad457e6b5dbe; 3a14152f47cbfd38db21a3d7e6b1b8cf0a887358; 2aee86d5bf73138010a76536183d896a7a5a3200; cb813dfc48247d0b65f1cb1084a5b4bccf6f3de8; 96547e98549e2ea799134afdadf3fc36be0998ed; e86cd1dc89075978cc0da29ca638f8fed795550d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a5ab73bca06b9592eba2f6bc79cd8b5eb0543c5c; 9fccaf5ad969fd850fbe8d96fbb60e2f9d99ac4c; d0380d748e7447ec4461df59fdba13ce2ec48ce5; 8b9adeb236028b7c10b9897b11525549117eef78; e04907a1c742ff705061fb1bb365cf0a6625382a; fc2e47c6f5d4c38196a2718105b7cdd3395dd0f7; 7ccbef175952202280ddb75a33df216c56c40807; b5c944e5d11a89b811d1b282c33ff558d1261e73; c7b95414f670bc2a1edbc9fa7113222e5d9fe716; 9c94bdfeaea60c11d4f55d5879067e341e0bf1c6; 08e50d1cc59a1d9c1a0d21dfe9667e243aa1094d; b1515125e66117eada8e96828ffab17e7bd73176; 25ed277f6e9a970a5fc26180a17ee97fc19ef78f; 30f88af6f0b6ff02f76599a82474767663f948d7; fe6fc66fcc80a7699d64eee4ee7b7464fa759037; 32bafce176433bb5dfd27ae3cc0de7652917ad08; 6306931928ad929c6d4f8127f0da40a4f6cd77dc; 1521f6f7fde059fae7e859f57011618e879af5d7; d992661b758681d4616f34e19539fe9774caa316; 9d8d00cfcd82834c89b1d29f4363ac422d259ee9; e71f1c7012a7605ab8fafe4d2520c8d9f63376e3; 42328a2214c0d04973945d65d2f33e95e432a6ee; 684dde789668d08e598761a2e149f1b02160b98e,Translational Psychiatry,5,
358f8e630d05042884ed10c2885a3a55f8fb2847,Multiple Comparisons with Control Under Stochastic Ordering: Controlling FDR,"Multiple comparisons of the effects of several treatments with a control (MCC) has been a central problem in medicine and other areas. Nearly all of existing papers are devoted to comparing means of the effects. To study medical problems more deeply, one needs more information than mean relationship from the given data. It can be expected to get more useful and deeper conclusion by comparing the probability distributions, i.e., by comparison under stochastic orders. This paper presents a likelihood ratio testing procedure to compare effects under stochastic order for MCC problems, controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Setting a test controlling FDR under stochastic order faces several non trivial problems. These problems are analyzed and solved in this paper. To facilitate the test more easily, the asymptotic p values for the test are used and their distributions are derived. It is shown that controllability of FDR for this comparison procedure can be guaranteed. A real data example is used to illustrate how to apply this testing procedure and what the test can tell. Simulation results show that this testing procedure works quite well, better than some other tests.",2015,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jianwei Gou"", ids = ""9873537""); list(name = ""Jinde Wang"", ids = ""71563177"")",,,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods,44,4507 - 4520

However, prior magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on maternal nutrients and infant brain have focused mostly on preterm infants or on few specific nutrients and few specific brain regions. We present a first study in term-born infants, comprehensively correlating 73 maternal nutrients with infant brain morphometry at the regional (61 regions) and voxel (over 300â€‰000 voxel) levels. Both maternal nutrition intake diaries and infant MRI were collected at 1Â month of life (0.9â€‰Â±â€‰0.5Â months) for 92 term-born infants (among them, 54 infants were purely breastfed and 19 were breastfed most of the time). Intake of nutrients was assessed via standardized food frequency questionnaire. No nutrient was significantly correlated with any of the volumes of the 61 autosegmented brain regions. However, increased volumes within subregions of the frontal cortex and corpus callosum at the voxel level were positively correlated with maternal intake of omega-3 fatty acids, retinol (vitamin A) and vitamin B12, both with and without correction for postmenstrual age and sex (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, qâ€‰<â€‰0.05 after false discovery rate correction). Omega-3 fatty acids remained significantly correlated with infant brain volumes after subsetting to the 54 infants who were exclusively breastfed, but retinol and vitamin B12 did not. This provides an impetus for future larger studies to better characterize the effect size of dietary variation and correlation with neurodevelopmental outcomes, which can lead to improved nutritional guidance during pregnancy and lactation.",2019,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Sarah U Morton"", ids = ""47235122""); list(name = ""Rutvi Vyas"", ids = ""50989133""); list(name = ""B.

07811c68763d350c4501d3dba877ca7b53e29367,On the generalization of BH procedure,"In modern multiple testing literature, there are many procedures proposed which control a certain rate of type I error, such as the false discovery rate (fdr). The method proposed in Benjamini and Hochberg [1995] (abbreviated as bh method) is shown to control fdr at any designated level under independence assumption. However, controlling fdr is not enough. It is important to develop â€œoptimalâ€ procedure which minimizes a certain rate of Type II error, subject to the controlling of fdr . Unfortunately, even the oracle version of bh method is not optimal for cases when the likelihood ratio h(x) = f1(x)/f0(x) is non-monotonic where f0(x) and f1(x) are the density function under the null and alternative hypothesis respectively. In this case, the optimal method is determined by cutting the function h(x), or local fdr introduced Efron at some threshold. However, the local fdr based method relies â€œgoodâ€ estimators of the density function, which has slow convergence rate. The data-driven version of the optimal method works poorly or even completely fails for cases as shown in this paper. In this paper, we proposed a generalized method of bh method (abbreviated as gbh ) which is optimal even for cases when h(x) is not monotone. The final proposed method uses the empirical cumulative distribution function (cdf) which converges faster than any density estimation. The resultant method works better than both the bh method and local fdr based approach.

Twenty crossbred weanling pigs were weighed, ear-tagged, and assigned to each of four dietary treatments, which included: 1) basal diet (BD) containing no AFB1 or CMN; 2) BD + 1.0 mg AFB1/kg of diet; 3) BD + 100 mg curcumin (CMN)/kg of diet, and; 4) BD + 100 mg CMN/kg of diet + 1.0 mg AFB1/kg of diet. Aflatoxin reduced (P < 0.05) body weight gain (BWG), feed intake (FI) and feed efficiency of pigs. The addition of CMN to the diet contaminated with AFB1 improved feed efficiency (P < 0.05) but not BWG and FI. At the end of three week treatment period, livers were collected and microarray analysis was conducted to identify pathways that control growth, development, coagulation, immune function, 32 metabolism, detoxification, and antioxidant status in liver of pigs. Genes with an adjusted permutation Fs test (false discovery rates) values less that 5% and fold change greater than 2.0 were considered differentially expressed across treatments. Changes in expression were determined using microarray technique and results were validated using quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR). Six genes were chosen for validation of expression using RT-qPCR, including TNF receptor superfamily, member 6 (FAS), glutathione S-transferase theta 1 (GSTT1), cyclin G1 (CCGN1), proteasome activator subunit 1 (PSME1), proteasome activator subunit 3 (PSME3), and cytochrome P450-2A19 (CYP2A19). There were no differences in the expression of the genes among the treatments except for GSTT1 and CYP2A19 that shifted the expression (down to up, and up to down regulation, respectively) with the addition of CMN to the diet contaminated with AFB1. Results demonstrate that pigs fed 1.0 mg AFB1/kg feed for 21 days had reduced growth performance associated with altered hepatic gene expression, and the supplementation of 100 mg CMN/kg to diets containing AFB1 had a protective effect on changes in gene expression in liver of pigs.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Rafael Azevedo Murarolli"", ids = ""10214643"")",63217dd3cece48f762b209a9dea136a2a97fbaa2; 1aa7416c5dfefe73977ef9a33a4578325a107d84; a450d10198a732b8d02ca138f99c5c48c9ec604c,e3ab82d99fc666669852c09fc6bcf155d1a7ff8f; 11d74f5a27c0586f4a41cabfda0e42d9111202e9; f18212e9144f56b26e51a70961e96d05c33b4faa; 7f788bc3ee1122f7e1518113b9bff8981b1be8e8; fe9cdaa646b1c22a26a5c962c1d408584b178e73; 60ebffc06296c78209086b35700357517b9e2f43; 5f78aab7e474fa77bee02216629b50089f855867; 9558d5ed22d5ebd12ac6b442d63669843aa0b726; 83e6053a171b8e5644d67785f43cac6a5a0cd92e; ad5665ec28549268eb275529a2832db1c3fd373e; d36c4e4be8b1ecec67353e9c690cd059d4958f64; b973be0a25642563891dcc6f27ba73d6316ce599; 3f5d6a239b24e0739207861b178c374d81dd62e3; d8b86f1e9b95cbe9a690ff37b12c543369c3dcf4; f626c9e9584916420b2fe418e3d5817a91ad7681; 24daabdf029d05cadee96664866937e628dfa753; b3c319de05a4953d5df4f6ffd2d4e8f9d92236ed; 2f607119e32105cedfc5e87d800e01a567df8fce; 601fae13f0cae8fee5c7f6c8ba72dfd2b72b5e41; 57149a2f858c590adae3d5d61279424aeb8a14a5; 327c859bd86d573bfae1efd34389a59fcb034338; 6962e26cc85adbd1d3dcb652adc6a6a2f5a25271; 029ea9d26e90ddf18a3e99caf24c021189363e34; b79ebc1e6e036f0202cce0dd4f7e35d6c9fbb857; bc80a2146a218941ca3578ac709c0d4bb6ccf786; 6032efed46e299f0c62e14a06c465d00c3e32044; ffae6094fb6b7a6428e4ae43c0afeb48d8c50c10; 8f2c03df8c1bd02571e5c781f05d7ccf6504f3c8; 34241ac27475d2bbb8390c79052a4304b98c16a8; 8229855373d04cae3f249e0db08e5124d2bd0f23; b4ca8e81fb186d7fdb55c796316d18e4cf5d71b3; a0527d8129b6ef1cd2bb527c3ca472401baa59ec; cafeba6e09d93911f1a7b131ef05bdfdb91effba; efeb9747a12027f31406539e136dac938273f4cf; 5cd17583ac4fa13cdb813282ef4900d18034093f; 1e406b07e31fc9c86ad107da7eb89a6d237b095f; d75db0a4dd492fdeb320e9faa5c20ee5033c1ac4; 93e4acf4ba3bca1b379ae8292e73dddb344abd90; 6f78472395ab344bdbb4a90e4528fbe0f11e9c1e; 396591c1b73cc8adad4bf2722f961ad9507d02f9; 77199d65fe62bbaa06f4cf44ce980ca7a1bcddd4; e4a27dbcf63d15d7b739c73afb98c11e790a6dce; 65091ddb86768a855931fbaf91b73267023e92a9; 1976c530cae9163bb10ba72be1815282bb815ef7; e74c90a1ffb4078ee022f1b5afecc3da259f60c4; f03d035dd4eea5f573921f0ea1f8e1b3056f0649; 3d46ccbe76e1424fb50a19a14760b7d512dd935e; bdb95729a8c4947d1f0b7c214d385d83803404fe; 7cc9496750d82e5d839159e7489e63351b404ea6; da97a88c63e750f601662c38339e55821d5325fb; 57ff9b791826926d57df0592b43a3cab16fd3347; f8e2009c00714d755f251b8407d94796b8674b52; b5860253e015c27e8b125cf9b7ba2cb543dc36ed; 06c302583b09fadf179dbea6958bbdaa877092b9; 91acf0f7a5374d6a669c4b0224c3b0d5b3016de6; b6d5b3bee4dc343343576531f006e933557c8d10; f028e265b469f1a0038d6a4d2ea9b65f8ec1db39; 562d8b4abe9a6c1eef0710bc299e2a9a99364458; 89118b9c643bfa65e7c95db7343683fe519c54b9; 6e0302abfcbe2d26697cafb41b4caac9bc908af0; ac2903f448faad78e4436a5a0ceb51618d4f4ccc; e7ffab98b378cd7ee37b55edf96e6367dd0ca95d; 45e851231a20311036f916ba43ec96f944e62486; 73604b207603488b8972e6a1c8f9223afd35e4f6,,,

The factors that contribute to deposit formation are not well understood. Recently, we identified the presence of spherular hydroxyapatite (HAP) structures within subâ€RPE deposits to which several AMDâ€associated proteins were bound. This suggested that protein binding to HAP represents a potential mechanism for the retention of proteins in the subâ€RPE space. Here we performed quantitative proteomics using Sequential Window Acquisition of all THeoretical fragmentâ€ion spectraâ€Mass Spectrometry (SWATHâ€MS) on plasma samples from 23 patients with lateâ€stage neovascular AMD following HAPâ€binding. Individuals were genotyped for the high risk CFH variant (T1277C) and binding to HAP was compared between wild type and risk variants. From a library of 242 HAP binding plasma proteins (1% false discovery rate), SWATHâ€MS revealed significant quantitative differences in the abundance of 32 HAPâ€binding proteins (p<0.05) between the two homozygous groups. The concentrations of six proteins (FHR1, FHR3, APOC4, C4A, C4B and PZP) in the HAP eluted fractions and whole plasma were further analysed using ELISA and their presence in sections from human cadaver eyes was examined using immunofluorescence. All six proteins were found to be present in the RPE/choroid interface, and four of these (FHR1, FHR3, APOC4 and PZP) were associated with spherules in subâ€RPE space. This study provides qualitative and quantitative information relating to the degree by which plasma proteins may contribute to subâ€RPE deposit formation through binding to HAP spherules and how genetic differences might contribute to deposit formation. HIGHLIGHTSHydroxyapatite (HAP) structures are thought to initiate subâ€RPE deposit formation.HAPâ€binding plasma proteins from individuals with AMD were analysed using SWATHâ€MS.Certain proteins exhibited differing abundance between CFHâ€based genotypic groups.Six proteins were present in the RPE/choroid and four were associated with HAP.Genetic differences can influence proteins involved in subâ€RPE deposit formation.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Swati Arya"", ids = ""46987901""); list(name = ""Eszter Emri"", ids = ""1404828002""); list(name = ""Silvia A Synowsky"", ids = ""5487388""); list(name = ""Sally L.

Biologic drug therapies represent a huge advance in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, very good disease control is achieved in only 30% of patients, making identification of biomarkers of response a research priority. We undertook this study to test our hypothesis that differential DNA methylation patterns may provide biomarkers predictive of response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) therapy in patients with RA.


METHODS
An epigenome-wide association study was performed on pretreatment whole blood DNA from patients with RA. Patients who displayed good response (nâ€‰=â€‰36) or no response (nâ€‰=â€‰36) to etanercept therapy at 3 months were selected. Differentially methylated positions were identified using linear regression. Variance of methylation at differentially methylated positions was assessed for correlation with cis-acting single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A replication experiment for prioritized SNPs was performed in an independent cohort of 1,204 RA patients.


RESULTS
Five positions that were differentially methylated between responder groups were identified, with a false discovery rate of <5%. The top 2 differentially methylated positions mapped to exon 7 of the LRPAP1 gene on chromosome 4 (cg04857395, Pâ€‰=â€‰1.39 Ã— 10(-8) and cg26401028, Pâ€‰=â€‰1.69 Ã— 10(-8) ). The A allele of the SNP rs3468 was correlated with higher levels of methylation for both of the top 2 differentially methylated positions (Pâ€‰=â€‰2.63 Ã— 10(-7) and Pâ€‰=â€‰1.05 Ã— 10(-6) , respectively). Furthermore, the A allele of rs3468 was correlated with European League Against Rheumatism nonresponse in the discovery cohort (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03; nâ€‰=â€‰56) and in the independent replication cohort (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.003; nâ€‰=â€‰1,204).


CONCLUSION
We identify DNA methylation as a potential biomarker of response to TNFi therapy, and we report the association between response and the LRPAP1 gene, which encodes a chaperone of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1.

a6e2450421b7df491efef259de303d59833a6115,Environmental Enteric Dysfunction is Associated with Carnitine Deficiency and Altered Fatty Acid Oxidation,"BACKGROUND
Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), a condition characterized by small intestine inflammation and abnormal gut permeability, is widespread in children in developing countries and a major cause of growth failure. The pathophysiology of EED remains poorly understood.


METHODS
We measured serum metabolites using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 400 children, aged 12-59months, from rural Malawi. Gut permeability was assessed by the dual-sugar absorption test.


FINDINGS
80.7% of children had EED. Of 677 serum metabolites measured, 21 were negatively associated and 56 were positively associated with gut permeability, using a false discovery rate approach (q<0.05, p<0.0095). Increased gut permeability was associated with elevated acylcarnitines, deoxycarnitine, fatty acid Î²-oxidation intermediates, fatty acid Ï‰-oxidation products, odd-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine-N-oxide, cystathionine, and homocitrulline, and with lower citrulline, ornithine, polyphenol metabolites, hippurate, tryptophan, and indolelactate.


INTERPRETATION
EED is a syndrome characterized by secondary carnitine deficiency, abnormal fatty acid oxidation, alterations in polyphenol and amino acid metabolites, and metabolic dysregulation of sulfur amino acids, tryptophan, and the urea cycle. Future studies are needed to corroborate the presence of secondary carnitine deficiency among children with EED and to understand how these metabolic derangements may negatively affect the growth and development of young children.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Richard David Semba"", ids = ""4040013""); list(name = ""Indi Trehan"", ids = ""4525197""); list(name = ""Ximin Li"", ids = ""48569281""); list(name = ""Ruin Moaddel"", ids = ""4354482""); list(name = ""Maria Isabel Ordiz"", ids = ""5116292""); list(name = ""Kenneth M Maleta"", ids = ""4692253""); list(name = ""Klaus Kraemer"", ids = ""79432029""); list(name = ""Michelle D Shardell"", ids = ""3851212""); list(name = ""Luigi Ferrucci"", ids = ""1737506""); list(name = ""Mark J Manary"", ids = ""2106437"")",43c02828cd4fb39b0367b831c735da037ad9c8ff; e9806e2c538eaaabc25a0ebbc5d105a4c1d4a613; aaeecbf0eec6b8b8b0a28ce95dfb9f477c77ed0a; 98f31cba30d109e10a3300057efb62eab6a69dfd; 01335e739aec0147b8005ed63faf3701888639a7; 98339170d37b81606b715eee625e5e91a9c62b85; 2bc774bab6378c28e98f5124eba60f5ca7e58324; 586fdce4dfa713fdfba4fa789a709d9861abda82; 5909419af96a2ca19676a13b3ff822a3296c3bfc,a7ff3f5f449e8716baed96921bba660bc71e37f7; ea1e73a6037bac5bab3afa4189efe7c28b80c502; b9d1984b28e49f3320ab4026e906593f9c94a6fc; 6be3fe286d3776b6b0e09baf4ea2724d1beddf08; d77b66ddeb787a4ec2ca6200ff1bdc4e694d4386; bdb4354cd4e6decaeab4c48080a668dccb7a01f4; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 8e10709c7f367aefdb6843664e9b8e2967c27bd1; f0456e84daa1e3a8b628025851402d1b1f681aa5; ce76a870a1dbae49ac867f8409031a5c649f297a; 72e331a935a001ba270271c15f5f094a9437552d; 1e06efeca1e26b3aa57cfa32c697d30e158fc144; 9a590fedd16acebeda18d323b12b707f0050707f; 6a4c6265461c827a467899038a6e2496de69e6c1; c84ea3790bd4758a36b6f71f023df2c638079afc; 79fa1f972d27e2c77dd85cdb61b61b1453f979e6; 215e5db8154343956fd2a6e0a91192e0be1f3505; 42ea2b7fa08b4d59cec64b3d903f668311a7d852; adaca0aac2b2f85f3dadc27435214a90065fa2ad; 805bedd99450d065f3a427eb6ec2e2ed8015a632; 13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986; b7f47a848b720292331e3b844bf8f895d2e1e362; 00c3bd335b473128400473bac6c712ba84401335; 62552c193c9277005d58a79aa02441aa066709de; ab736c1878b7edb7b58768f6bbb6ecf063666d1b; 0eaa3f108e286c2522fe3f63d4d18c30b99011bf; 7b440669bef15205564bddae43fac87a18062180; 92fa9a172ba181de1e95902ebe0a068ed0aa4d8f; b64356069e77c6dda91a3b6df696cba442611f24; 89148e8a24e1e883a93c31e4ced292b4faea6b68; cb1a7558ea4d4c8211b8a14777a4352f74251ac1; 0759441f1531baf736941e4f7de27eb5048d5f63; ef2bf066511a33f411856ba2f249649db79aad29; 69b776f2b99e33bcc8773b7b04b9f47d96206a81; 069703d1a19979a262df144c83fc448b42c91a64; 20b1c8f7eed6f892c957f939e5bdc3f28aa69bff; 8bbf455a7d073774be6e8e92bab44ecc15b609b4; 848ef00678d0cf2e54008422ad310949bd973709; 3ef9897ff876abe159208a92d561bd0499ffccec; f2d2a7ce03e1a5c1e0c154f749e79ca91f8009e9; c50a9c49be240213397e7d05973e20f36bfc1128; cedb54aee0968a085f2310989e71cad6d6159360; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 72ca3d6286cfa62dbbfe3fdbe2205fd0009f0847; a2c9d78f8808596ee31a11bd1e5ac7fe601a0764; 70917582f4da536eed9191e32da9780061f3e41f; 992b2e6bb683960eba22fb71b6a1a558b406a559; fc05e174f1f294a3f228acdf2fc8af70b426f856; 7d212736d32598b396d1076e8e659ac6f49d7912; 55f43314e956d4b6a917735864593dd8671c5172; 60222e79735e9b022e6afaeed8aef7376e44b702; 22d7008116f70ca35d2247f8990d5d16f5103682; 97f1d3a6cc57b6b99bf63e17b3082fc2a7224d95; 57aeff833b712b57547e656b7cbd8e55edac88b5; a85e81f6f330dff0a5f55a2fe2c226e1d89ca5dc; 22b0cf4a1b16cfca5325ca118e830693d8c2d674; 141104fbb087da561d940cd123f7e528fed47acc; 9f0e0fd19a969685c18ccea8d85dcb08da766964; adc79f6159774ddc1b98ae7eb54dcb7a9f778208; 1679beddda3a183714d380e944fe6bf586c083cd; c17ff963930a7e7b0933abf9f0a67d8f8fd0eecc; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 3c1a1bc5ae34df740eff37a3c323eb6f0b9fdf45; e6d80cec9a08ef839dbc09202521ecbe545ff06f; 5f0b638806e7fe53e56ba241edabe43c5cd7cab4,EBioMedicine,17,57 - 66
17cb745e630e3f4ea74132f448c318cc3f82fd89,Mapping genes that contribute to daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity.,"Daunorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic agent used in the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies. Toxicities associated with this agent include myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity; however, the genes or genetic determinants that contribute to these toxicities are unknown. We present an unbiased genome-wide approach that incorporates heritability, whole-genome linkage analysis, and linkage-directed association to uncover genetic variants contributing to the sensitivity to daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. Cell growth inhibition in 324 Centre d' Etude du Polymorphisme Humain lymphoblastoid cell lines (24 pedigrees) was evaluated following treatment with daunorubicin for 72 h. Heritability analysis showed a significant genetic component contributing to the cytotoxic phenotypes (h2 = 0.18-0.63 at 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 1.0 mumol/L daunorubicin and at the IC50, the dose required to inhibit 50% cell growth). Whole-genome linkage scans at all drug concentrations and IC50 uncovered 11 regions with moderate peak LOD scores (> 1.5), including 4q28.2 to 4q32.3 with a maximum LOD score of 3.18. The quantitative transmission disequilibrium tests were done using 31,312 high-frequency single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located in the 1 LOD confidence interval of these 11 regions. Thirty genes were identified as significantly associated with daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity (P < or = 2.0 x 10(-4), false discovery rate < or = 0.1). Pathway and functional gene ontology analysis showed that these genes were overrepresented in the phosphatidylinositol signaling system, axon guidance pathway, and GPI-anchored proteins family. Our findings suggest that a proportion of susceptibility to daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity may be controlled by genetic determinants and that analysis using linkage-directed association studies with dense SNP markers can be used to identify the genetic variants contributing to cytotoxicity.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Shiwei Duan"", ids = ""50395675""); list(name = ""Wasim K.

b36756345752f71848888c656ecf5fb666382e00,Urinary melamine and adult urolithiasis in Taiwan.,"BACKGROUND
This study aims to investigate the association between urinary melamine concentration and the risk of urolithiasis in adult.


METHODS
From 2003 to 2007, 11 and 22 patients diagnosed with upper urinary tract uric acid urolithiasis and calcium urolithiasis, respectively, were recruited from Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital. For comparison, we randomly collected 22 sex- and age-matched subjects who come to the same hospital for regular health check-up at the same period of time. Urinary melamine concentration was measured by the method of triple-quadrupole liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the urinary melamine concentrations in uric acid urolithiasis patients with controls as well as in calcium urolithiasis patients with controls. FDR (false discovery rate) was used to correct the p-values for two comparisons.


RESULTS
Subjects with uric acid urolithiasis (median: 0.50 vs 0.06microg/mmol creatinine, Wilcoxon test: FDR_p=0.024) and with calcium urolithiasis (median: 0.14 vs 0.06, FDR_p=0.024) had significantly higher urinary melamine concentration than controls. Based on the ROC curves, subjects whose melamine levels were over 0.262 and 0.037microg/mmol creatinine, respectively, might have significant risks to have uric acid and calcium urolithiasis.


CONCLUSION
This preliminary study suggests that exposure to even low-dose melamine-related products still have the potential to develop both uric acid and calcium urolithiasis in adults.",2010,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Chia-Fang Wu"", ids = ""80062082""); list(name = ""Chia-Chu Liu"", ids = ""6832325""); list(name = ""Bai-Hsiun Chen"", ids = ""78754901""); list(name = ""Shu-Pin Huang"", ids = ""48668833""); list(name = ""Hei-Hwa Lee"", ids = ""9675548""); list(name = ""Yii-Her Chou"", ids = ""145161407""); list(name = ""W.

1374b8576a65ae32ee2a839dd0d26044438d26f0,The Human Dental Pulp Proteome and N-Terminome: Levering the Unexplored Potential of Semitryptic Peptides Enriched by TAILS to Identify Missing Proteins in the Human Proteome Project in Underexplored Tissues.,"An underexplored yet widespread feature of the human proteome is the proteolytic proteoforms of proteins. We used terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS), a high-content N-terminal positional proteomics technique, for in-depth characterization of the human dental pulp proteome from its N-terminome and to provide data for the Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP). Dental pulp is a unique connective tissue maintaining tooth sensation and structure by supporting a single cell layer of odontoblasts that synthesize mineralization-competent dentine extracellular matrix. Therefore, we posited pulp to be a rich source of unique tissue-specific proteins and hence an abundant source of ""missing"" proteins as defined by neXtProt. From the identified 4332 proteins (false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤ 0.7%), 21â€¯528 unique peptides (FDR â‰¤ 1.0%) and 9079 unique N-termini, we analyzed N-terminal methionine excision, co- and posttranslational NÎ±-acetylation, protein maturation, and proteolytic processing. Apart from 227 candidate alternative translation initiation sites, most identified N-termini (78%) represented proteolytic processing and mechanism-informative internal neo-N-termini, confirming a pervasive amount of proteolytic-processing generated proteoforms in vivo. Furthermore, we identified 17 missing protein candidates for the C-HPP, highlighting the importance of using (i) less studied human specimens and (ii) orthogonal proteomic approaches such as TAILS to map the human proteome.

A q-value is a measure of significance for a particular feature, analagous to a p-value. However, where the p-value assigns significance in terms of the false positive rate, the q-value assigns significance in terms of the false discovery rate. See [2] for more detailed information. This document provides a tutorial for using the qvalue package. The package consists of four functions (qvalue for computing q-values from p-values, qplot for visualizing the results with graphs, qsummary for visualizing the results with a table, and qwrite for writing the output to file) and a GUI (qvalue.gui). As with any R package, detailed information on functions, their arguments and value, can be obtained in the help files. For instance, to view the help file for the function qvalue within R, type ? qvalue.",2006,,"list(name = ""Alan R. Dabney"", ids = ""1747095""); list(name = ""John D.

However, there is a lack of rigorous work on evaluating the statistical power for identifying these variants. In this paper, we consider sparse signal identification in genome-wide association studies and present two analytical frameworks for detailed analysis of the statistical power for detecting and identifying the disease-associated variants. We present an explicit sample size formula for achieving a given false non-discovery rate while controlling the false discovery rate based on an optimal procedure. Sparse genetic variant recovery is also considered and a boundary condition is established in terms of sparsity and signal strength for almost exact recovery of both disease-associated variants and nondiseaseassociated variants. A data-adaptive procedure is proposed to achieve this bound. The analytical results are illustrated with a genome-wide association study of neuroblastoma.",2011,,"list(name = ""Ask Us"", ids = ""46827110"")",,8d4a82f8262abfb55754990665146f8bca94d8d6; 0f07c69cde4ee6f453fa22f449347b470395d53f; 3fe4480e862332f60a7087e1dde6c51a79cbbaa6; 6f24b15fb3ef4cba014a0e5bbe68937226ad4814; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 80c74a0e0dbe2eef154151370a81bbd4cde0007c; 130183ef155b8942a9c327e236813698d4c478d4; 94c85e601786240383a5afeb62be45dc7938e653; 6bbb79cc026ecca4264d95c4551fc58205b09533; 76843150b8a2ef12b75d10fbb2adcb3db6ef5e05; d83f37659d418a915c0b06def402bd0c32ae0ca8; a9082bbfcc2b4374f4367d47e14ed76d73cf4d70; b77a86b4786666510a1372fecc0d1cc3c824f843; 50b6a37dea80346593c2539245da25291c3678b0; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 0cc325ee022c258b30da3247a60828f7adf4d14c; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; 5bde00bbd8b6b59e319f0b585e24ccd7956ed080,,,
b1b4866881b896aa4fae73d440b928365b3e1e9f,A regression framework for the proportion of true null hypotheses,"Modern scientific studies from many diverse areas of research abound with multiple hypothesis testing concerns. The false discovery rate is one of the most commonly used error rates for measuring and controlling rates of false discoveries when performing multiple tests. Adaptive false discovery rates rely on an estimate of the proportion of null hypotheses among all the hypotheses being tested. This proportion is typically estimated once for each collection of hypotheses. Here we propose a regression framework to estimate the proportion of null hypotheses conditional on observed covariates. We provide both finite sample and asymptotic conditions under which this covariate-adjusted estimate is conservative - leading to appropriately conservative false discovery rate estimates. Our case study concerns a genome-wise association meta-analysis which considers associations with body mass index. In our framework, we are able to use the sample sizes for the individual genomic loci and the minor allele frequencies as covariates.

4d7b8ec4d6a97cfb7cd524cd24ccf920748912b0,Inferring Protein Associations Using Protein Pulldown Assays,"Background: One method to infer protein-protein associations is through a â€œbait-prey pulldownâ€ assay using a protein affinity agent and an LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry)-based protein identification method. False positive and negative protein identifications are not uncommon, however, leading to incorrect inferences. Methods: A pulldown experiment generates a protein association matrix wherein each column represents a sample from one bait protein, each row represents one prey protein and each cell contains a presence/absence association indicator. Our method evaluates the presence/absence pattern across a prey protein (row) with a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT), computing its p-value with simulated LRT test statistic distributions after a check with simulated binomial random variates disqualified the large sample 2 test. A pulldown experiment often involves hundreds of tests so we apply the false discovery rate method to control the false positive rate. Based on the p-value, each prey protein is assigned a category (specific association, non-specific association, or not associated) and appraised with respect to the pulldown experimentâ€™s goal and design. The method is illustrated using a pulldown experiment investigating the protein complexes of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Results: The Monte Carlo simulated LRT p-values objectively reveal specific and ubiquitous prey, as well as potential systematic errors.moreÂ Â» The example analysis shows the results to be biologically sensible and more realistic than the ad hoc screening methods previously utilized. Conclusions: The method presented appears to be informative for screening for protein-protein associations.Â«Â less",2007,Biology,"list(name = ""Julia L.

Our method allows for the direct comparison between actual experimental conditions, regardless of sample content and without the use of internal standards. The modeling uses linear regression of peptide retention time as a function of amino acid composition. We demonstrate the pH dependency of the model in a control experiment where the pH of the mobile phase was changed in controlled way. We introduce a score to identify the false discovery rate on peptide spectrum match level that corresponds to the set of most robust models, i.e. to maximize the shared agreement between experiments. We demonstrate the method utility in reversed-phase liquid chromatography using 24 datasets with minimal peptide overlap. We apply our method on datasets obtained from a public repository representing various separation designs, including one-dimensional reversed-phase liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry, and two-dimensionalÂ online strong cation exchange coupled to reversed-phase liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry, and highlight new insights.

058411510d7100ccca38eb9e0c59eb07f5434070,Integrating genome-wide association study and expression quantitative trait loci data identifies multiple genes and gene set associated with neuroticism,"ABSTRACT Neuroticism is a fundamental personality trait with significant genetic determinant. To identify novel susceptibility genes for neuroticism, we conducted an integrative analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data of genome wide association study (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study. GWAS summary data was driven from published studies of neuroticism, totally involving 170,906 subjects. eQTL dataset containing 927,753 eQTLs were obtained from an eQTL metaâ€analysis of 5311 samples. Integrative analysis of GWAS and eQTL data was conducted by summary dataâ€“based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis software. To identify neuroticism associated gene sets, the SMR analysis results were further subjected to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The gene set annotation dataset (containing 13,311 annotated gene sets) of GSEA Molecular Signatures Database was used. SMR single gene analysis identified 6 significant genes for neuroticism, including MSRA (p value = 2.27 Ã— 10âˆ’ 10), MGC57346 (p value = 6.92 Ã— 10âˆ’ 7), BLK (p value = 1.01 Ã— 10âˆ’ 6), XKR6 (p value = 1.11 Ã— 10âˆ’ 6), C17ORF69 (p value = 1.12 Ã— 10âˆ’ 6) and KIAA1267 (p value = 4.00 Ã— 10âˆ’ 6). Gene set enrichment analysis observed significant association for Chr8p23 gene set (false discovery rate = 0.033). Our results provide novel clues for the genetic mechanism studies of neuroticism.

892f9f5a0dcc62661813d61c390bbef1e8615fd0,Fragmentation-free LC-MS can identify hundreds of proteins.,"One of the most common approaches for large-scale protein identification is LC, followed by MS. If more than a few proteins are to be identified, the additional fragmentation of individual peptides has so far been considered as indispensable, and thus, the associated costs, in terms of instrument time and infrastructure, as unavoidable. Here, we present evidence to the contrary. Using a combination of (i) highly accurate and precise mass measurements, (ii) modern retention time prediction, and (iii) a robust scoring algorithm, we were able to identify 257 proteins of Francisella tularensis from a single LC-MS experiment in a fragmentation-free approach (i.e. without experimental fragmentation spectra). This number amounts to 59% of the number of proteins identified in a standard fragmentation-based approach, when executed with the same false discovery rate. Independent evidence supports at least 27 of a set of 31 proteins that were identified only in the fragmentation-free approach. Our results suggest that additional developments in retention time prediction, measurement technology, and scoring algorithms may render fragmentation-free approaches an interesting complement or an alternative to fragmentation-based approaches.",2011,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Pascal Bochet"", ids = ""4340762""); list(name = ""Frank RÃ¼gheimer"", ids = ""1992328""); list(name = ""Tina Guina"", ids = ""3888191""); list(name = ""Peter Brooks"", ids = ""50232802""); list(name = ""David R.

f56925ecffa5dd6fd3f8a73d23cfc1e8afc1b140,Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI texture analysis for pretreatment prediction of clinical and pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of texture analysis, applied to dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), to predict the clinical and pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) before NAC is started. Fifty-eight patients with LABC were classified on the basis of their clinical response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines after four cycles of NAC, and according to their pathological response after surgery. T1 -weighted DCE-MRI with a temporal resolution of 1â€‰min was acquired on a 3-T Siemens Trio scanner using a dedicated four-channel breast coil before the onset of treatment. Each lesion was segmented semi-automatically using the 2-min post-contrast subtracted image. Sixteen texture features were obtained at each non-subtracted post-contrast time point using a gray level co-occurrence matrix. Appropriate statistical analyses were performed and false discovery rate-based q values were reported to correct for multiple comparisons. Statistically significant results were found at 1-3â€‰min post-contrast for various texture features for the prediction of both the clinical and pathological response. In particular, eight texture features were found to be statistically significant at 2â€‰min post-contrast, the most significant feature yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77 for response prediction for stable disease versus complete responders after four cycles of NAC. In addition, four texture features were found to be significant at the same time point, with an AUC of 0.69 for response prediction using the most significant feature for classification based on the pathological response. Our results suggest that texture analysis could provide clinicians with additional information to increase the accuracy of prediction of an individual response before NAC is started.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jose Ramon Teruel"", ids = ""35460972""); list(name = ""Mariann Gjervik Heldahl"", ids = ""6595741""); list(name = ""PÃ¥l Erik Goa"", ids = ""2094003""); list(name = ""Martin D.

We selected 96 ALL survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study: 48 obese and 48 normal weight. The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to compare DNA methylation at 211 loci identified in EWAS of BMI in the general population. Thirty-nine loci were associated (false discovery rate <0.05) with obesity among survivors who only received chemotherapy (nâ€‰=â€‰49). No loci were significantly associated with obesity among CRT-exposed survivors (nâ€‰=â€‰47).

fc1c2235223b5f12dafa05ea362b4269a6dfc9b8,Genome-Wide Association Analyses Identify SPOCK as a Key Novel Gene Underlying Age at Menarche,"For females, menarche is a most significant physiological event. Age at menarche (AAM) is a trait with high genetic determination and is associated with major complex diseases in women. However, specific genes for AAM variation are largely unknown. To identify genetic factors underlying AAM variation, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) examining about 380,000 SNPs was conducted in 477 Caucasian women. A follow-up replication study was performed to validate our major GWAS findings using two independent Caucasian cohorts with 854 siblings and 762 unrelated subjects, respectively, and one Chinese cohort of 1,387 unrelated subjects--all females. Our GWAS identified a novel gene, SPOCK (Sparc/Osteonectin, CWCV, and Kazal-like domains proteoglycan), which had seven SNPs associated with AAM with genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR) q<0.05. Six most significant SNPs of the gene were selected for validation in three independent replication cohorts. All of the six SNPs were replicated in at least one cohort. In particular, SNPs rs13357391 and rs1859345 were replicated both within and across different ethnic groups in all three cohorts, with p values of 5.09 x 10(-3) and 4.37 x 10(-3), respectively, in the Chinese cohort and combined p values (obtained by Fisher's method) of 5.19 x 10(-5) and 1.02 x 10(-4), respectively, in all three replication cohorts. Interestingly, SPOCK can inhibit activation of MMP-2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2), a key factor promoting endometrial menstrual breakdown and onset of menstrual bleeding. Our findings, together with the functional relevance, strongly supported that the SPOCK gene underlies variation of AAM.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yao-zhong Liu"", ids = ""7137552""); list(name = ""Yan-Fang Guo"", ids = ""1991040""); list(name = ""Liang Wang"", ids = ""48169685""); list(name = ""Li-jun Tan"", ids = ""2668355""); list(name = ""Xiao-gang Liu"", ids = ""38066027""); list(name = ""Yu-Fang Pei"", ids = ""7331433""); list(name = ""Han Yan"", ids = ""145341032""); list(name = ""Dong-hai Xiong"", ids = ""2498689""); list(name = ""Fei-Yan Deng"", ids = ""144184148""); list(name = ""Na Yu"", ids = ""144147404""); list(name = ""Yin-Ping Zhang"", ids = ""2023188""); list(name = ""Lei Zhang"", ids = ""48570934""); list(name = ""Shufeng Lei"", ids = ""2276400""); list(name = ""Xiang-ding Chen"", ids = ""2259300""); list(name = ""Hong-bin Liu"", ids = ""22148439""); list(name = ""Xue-zhen Zhu"", ids = ""8362120""); list(name = ""Shawn Levy"", ids = ""47773959""); list(name = ""Christopher J.

dd857d04c991eb7a2a05804bd9e94c109bc930d1,An application of gene set analysis for a comparison of two groups,"Background: Microarrays are biotechnological advancements measuring expressions of thousands of genes in a single assay. A two-group microarray study yields gene expression measurements for patients with a disease of interest and for healthy controls. Successful identification of genes differentiating between the two groups leads to new and improved treatments. While microarrays represent an exciting avenue for clinicians, the analysis of the large amount of data coming from these experiments comes with many challenges. The large number of features measured on a relatively small number of patients (the so-called p N problem), the small variability in some of the genes, and the correlations across genes are characteristics of microarray data and need to be addressed in analysis. Objective: Our objective is to apply the methods of microarray data analysis to kidney transplant patients. The two groups consist of patients experiencing a more severe type of rejection, T-Cell Mediated rejection (TCMR), versus patients experiencing a borderline rejection. Methods: We apply Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) to explore genes differentially expressed between the two groups. While SAM is a sound statistical method useful for exploring the data at the gene level, the output of thousands of significant genes is hard to interpret. There has been a shift of focus towards analysis at the gene set level. Biologists put together databases consisting of genes grouped by biological function, called biological pathways, or gene sets. The analysis at a gene set (pathway) level, called Gene Set Analysis (GSA), is easier to interpret, and more robust, in the sense that significant gene sets are more likely to be replicated across studies and microarray platforms. GSA addresses the p N problem via permutation tests. GSA methods can be broadly classified into self-contained methods, based on group labels permutations, and competitive methods based on subject permutations. We prefer the former, as it is preserves the correlations among genes in a pathway. We present the two top self-contained methods, called Significance Analysis of Microarrays for Gene Sets (SAM-GS) and Multivariate Analysis of Variance for Gene Sets (MANOVA-GSA), as they perform best according to previous simulation studies and real applications. We also present results of the most popular GSA, which is a hybrid between self-contained and competitive methods. False Discovery Rates are calculated to address multiple hypothesis testing. Results: Our data consists of expression measurements for 54,675 probes on 17 kidney transplant patients experiencing TCMR and 27 kidney transplant patients experiencing borderline rejection. The 54,675 expression measurements were reduced to 20,736 unique genes. For gene sets, we use the most recent version of the C2 catalogue consisting of 1892 gene sets, representing metabolic and signalling pathways from online pathway databases, gene sets from biomedical literature including 340 PubMed articles, and gene sets compiled from published mammalian microarray studies. We restricted the size of gene sets to be between 5 and 500, resulting in 1,839 gene sets used for our analysis. We found 957 significant genes with FDR values smaller than 5.71%. SAM-GS identified 58 pathways with p-value< 0.001 (FDRs < 1.8%). Among these, CDK5 and Interferon-gamma are only two examples of pathways previously established as associated with kidney transplant rejection.",2011,Biology,"list(name = ""Ya Meng"", ids = ""97577555"")",,17a1420507630c2b07e0bcaf55783636f4b20e54; 59eb429a8a3a545efdb8f1f8382c43d02c683851; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; e79d5ee47a7f0ed2681a8a897fe320f2a2455073; 37f47ce11ad87b569cab4acf6316df5dac7b433a; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 0c2753df73bb3671bad8ef48763443d8f7a213ef; d7203a27edddacbc573a29754bc192f7bedecaca; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; d2860a370a0386c57fecc4eef2e43779352fa410; f84e41cf6ea32ca46dd8136094ef7e85b2814174; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 3e21fcfca12cad135252dfaf516a853644e8d15f; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; b5c595199cb1bacb4653db893b7a0cc915f303ad; 9b60044ce46dab2122ee8f65225670de9ae77401; d42337ecab378287fbcd60b42e5ceb5b67b6f59a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b991352c899f483e5fe341b0bc3557157f4aace8; 9e26c8be21f341102016fa5a67b06db362bf272a; 8d8bfd4c474127384eb0cdfee30bd8e9ceb14b8f,,,

Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms is limited. The present study aimed to determine potential biomarkers of AC through transcriptomic analysis. This multi-centre study investigated patients undergoing arthroscopic capsulotomy surgery for resistant AC compared to those undergoing arthroscopic stabilization surgery for glenohumeral instability (control). Tissue samples were harvested from the anterior capsule during surgery. Total RNA was extracted and RNA-sequencing-based transcriptomics were performed. A number of genes deemed differentially expressed in RNA-sequencing analysis were validated using real-time RT-PCR. Baseline characteristics of the AC group (n= 22) were; mean age 52.7 years (SD 10.2), 73% female, and Oxford Shoulder Score 19.6 (SD 8.0), compared with the control group (n= 26), average age 23.9 years (SD 5.2), 15% female, and Oxford Shoulder Score 39.0 (SD 7.4). Transcriptomic analysis with false discovery rate (FDR) correction and log2 fold change (LFC) cut-off of +/- 1.5 revealed 545 differentially-expressed genes in AC relative to control. Bioinformatic analyses were carried out to identify biological processes and pathways enriched in this dataset. Real-time RT-PCR using two different normalisation processes confirmed increased expression ofMMP13 andPDGFB, in patients with AC, while TNFA expression was reduced.These findings provide a comprehensive assessment of transcriptional changes associated with AC that give insights into the aetiology of the disease and provides a resource for molecular targets to better diagnose and treat this condition. Clinical significance: Novel biomarkers and pathways have been identified which may lead to earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment of AC. This article is protected by copyright.

51f16b8b7fc48db3f11f2d51ddc3e8ba66f63863,Long versus short oligonucleotide microarrays for the study of gene expression in nonhuman primates,"The high degree of sequence similarity between human and nonhuman primate (NHP) genomic DNA suggests that human genome sequence-based DNA microarrays may be used effectively to study gene expression in NHP disease models. In the present study, two distinct commercially available human genome microarray platforms, the Affymetrix HG U133A GeneChip System utilizing Human Genome U133A GeneChips and the Applied Biosystems Expression Array System utilizing the Human Genome Survey Microarray, were used to identify and characterize gene expression changes in the anterior cerebellum of a macaque monkey model of human alcoholism. The Affymetrix microarray consists of eleven short oligonucleotide probe sets for each gene while the Applied Biosystems Microarray uses a single long oligonucleotide per gene. Cross-mapping of probes revealed a total of 11,542 genes that are represented on both microarray platforms. Absolute measures of gene expression (""present calls"") from the cerebellum RNA samples were 65-70% (Applied Biosystems Expression Array System) and 27-30% (AffymetrixGeneChip System) among these common gene targets. Analysis of variance (ANOVA; p<0.05; >1.2 fold change; detected on at least 50% of the arrays) indicated 932 and 515 differentially expressed genes for the Applied Biosystems and Affymetrix microarrays, respectively. Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) identified 255 significant genes at 5% false discovery rate (FDR) for the Applied Biosystems data set and five significant genes at 60% FDR (minimum FDR) for the Affymetrix data set. TaqMan assay-based real-time PCR validation of a number of differentially-expressed genes yielded results that agreed well with the array data in the majority of comparisons. This study demonstrates that human sequence-based DNA arrays can be used effectively to detect differential gene expression in an NHP disease model and provides evidence that the use of this long oligonucleotide-based microarray platform may be more suitable for cross-species gene expression studies than a short oligonucleotide-based system.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Stephen J Walker"", ids = ""3156241""); list(name = ""Yulei Wang"", ids = ""2169556""); list(name = ""Kathleen A.

8d1f654b456cec464e2ebdb0ab8ac97adeaa290b,Use of combination proteomic analysis to demonstrate molecular similarity of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma arising from different subsites.,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) for differences in protein expression between oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx subsites.


DESIGN
Retrospective proteomic analysis using tissue microarray (TMA) and 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). For the TMA, automated quantitative protein expression analysis was used to interrogate levels of 4 cell-cycle regulatory proteins chosen for their known roles in cancer (cyclin D1, p53, Rb, and p14). For the 2D-DIGE, lesional and normal adjacent tissues were enriched by laser capture microdissection. Total protein was extracted, analyzed by 2D-DIGE with saturation dye labeling, and evaluated for relative abundance levels of individual protein spots.


SETTING
Two tertiary-care academic medical centers.


PATIENTS
Seventy-one patients with HNSCC for TMA, and 14 patients with HNSCC with frozen tumor and normal tissue for 2D-DIGE.


RESULTS
The automated quantitative analysis of protein expression analysis revealed no difference between subsite for cyclin D1, p53, Rb, or p14 expression. The 2D-DIGE study was based on 28 gels (14 cancer gels and 14 adjacent normal gels), and 732 spots were identified as matching across more than 90% of gels. Significance was evaluated based on false discovery rate (FDR) estimated from permuted data sets. There were no significant differences in protein expression between subsites (FDR greater than or equal to 30% in all instances).


CONCLUSIONS
Observed differences in outcomes between HNSCCs from different subsites may not reflect differences in tumor biologic characteristics between subsites. Rather, it is possible that observed clinical heterogeneity among HNSCCs may be based on other factors, such as viral vs chemical carcinogenesis.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Paul Maurice Weinberger"", ids = ""3051336""); list(name = ""Mark Merkley"", ids = ""47974182""); list(name = ""Jeffrey Roberts Lee"", ids = ""1791811""); list(name = ""Bao-Ling Adam"", ids = ""145241335""); list(name = ""Christine G Gourin"", ids = ""4982677""); list(name = ""Robert H Podolsky"", ids = ""145961217""); list(name = ""Bruce G.

In total, 4,286,250 (foragers) and 3,422,327 (nurses) clean tags were sequenced, 24,568 (foragers) and 13,134 (nurses) distinct clean tags could not be match to the reference database, and 7508 and 6875 mapped genes were detected in foragers and nurses respectively. 7045 genes were found differentially expressed between foragers and nurses. Of those genes, 1621 genes had significantly different expression, that is, they showed an expression ratio (foragers/nurses) of more than 2 and FDR (False Discovery Rate) of less than 0.001. We identified 101 genes that were uniquely expressed in foragers, and 9 genes that were only expressed in nurses. We performed the Gene Ontology (GO) category and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, and found 415 genes with annotation terms linked to the GO cellular component category. 200 components of KEGG pathways were obtained, including 21 signaling pathways.

e5bd1f312b08c0f313ba3baed672d9a230433c6e,Genome-wide DNA methylation differences in nucleus accumbens of smokers vs. nonsmokers,"Numerous DNA methylation (DNAm) biomarkers of cigarette smoking have been identified in peripheral blood studies, but their relevance as neurobiological indicators is unknown due to DNAm tissue-specificity. In contrast, blood-based studies may not detect brain-specific smoking-related DNAm differences that may provide greater insight into the neurobiology of smoking behaviors. We report the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of smoking in human postmortem brain, focusing on nucleus accumbens (NAc) as a key brain region in developing addiction. Following Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC array data generation and quality control, 221 decedents (120 European American [23% current smokers], 101 African American [26% current smokers]) were analyzed. DNAm by smoking (current vs. nonsmoking) was tested using robust linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, cell-type proportion, DNAm-derived negative control principal components (PCs), and genotype-derived PCs. Separate ancestry-specific results were combined via meta-analysis, resulting in 7 CpGs that exceeded false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05. Using published smoking EWAS results in blood, we extended our NAc findings to identify DNAm smoking effects that are unique (tissue-specific) versus shared between tissues (tissue-shared). Of the 7 CpGs identified in NAc, 3 CpGs were located near genes previously indicated with blood-based smoking DNAm biomarkers: ZIC1, ZCCHC24, and PRKDC. The other 4 CpGs are novel for smoking-related DNAm changes: ABLIM3, APCDD1L, MTMR6, and CTCF. Our results provide the first evidence for smoking-related DNAm changes in human NAc, highlighting CpGs that were previously undetected as peripheral biomarkers and may reflect brain-specific processes.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Christina A Markunas"", ids = ""3708916""); list(name = ""Stephen A Semick"", ids = ""51205799""); list(name = ""Bryan C Quach"", ids = ""10123241""); list(name = ""Ran Tao"", ids = ""143677598""); list(name = ""Amy Deep-Soboslay"", ids = ""1384088646""); list(name = ""Laura J.

Plasma metabolites were profiled by LC-MS/MS. Penalised regression models were used to select measured metabolites for type 2 diabetes incidence classification (training dataset) and to internally validate the discriminatory capability of selected metabolites beyond conventional type 2 diabetes risk factors (testing dataset).ResultsOver a follow-up period of 20Â years, 95 individuals with NFG developed type 2 diabetes. Nineteen metabolites were selected repeatedly in the training dataset for type 2 diabetes incidence classification and were found to improve type 2 diabetes risk prediction beyond conventional type 2 diabetes risk factors (AUC was 0.81 for risk factors vs 0.90 for risk factors + metabolites, pâ€‰=â€‰1.1â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’4). Using pathway enrichment analysis, the nitrogen metabolism pathway, which includes three prioritised metabolites (glycine, taurine and phenylalanine), was significantly enriched for association with type 2 diabetes risk at the false discovery rate of 5% (pâ€‰=â€‰0.047). In adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, the type 2 diabetes risk per 1 SD increase in glycine, taurine and phenylalanine was 0.65 (95% CI 0.54, 0.78), 0.73 (95% CI 0.59, 0.9) and 1.35 (95% CI 1.11, 1.65), respectively. Mendelian randomisation demonstrated a similar relationship for type 2 diabetes risk per 1 SD genetically increased glycine (OR 0.89 [95% CI 0.8, 0.99]) and phenylalanine (OR 1.6 [95% CI 1.08, 2.4]).Conclusions/interpretationIn individuals with NFG, information from a discrete set of 19 metabolites improved prediction of type 2 diabetes beyond conventional risk factors.

d3cbfb93eb9885b0e4d1536c12c1effc92e720ed,Alteration of cerebello-thalamocortical spontaneous low-frequency oscillations in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.,"OBJECTIVE
Altered thalamocortical network has been proposed to play a pivotal role in the principal pathophysiology underlying juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Recently, resting-state fMRI studies have provided converging evidence for thalamocortical dysconnectivity in patients with JME. Herein, we investigated the amplitude and spatial distribution of spontaneous low-frequency oscillations using analysis of fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) in a large group of JME patients in comparison with controls.


METHODS
Volumetric MRI and resting-state fMRI were acquired in 75 patients with JME and 62 matched controls. After preprocessing of MRI data, fALFF was computed and then Z-transformed for standardization. fALFF was compared between controls and patients, and correlation analysis between regional fALFF and clinical parameters were performed in patients.


RESULTS
Compared with controls, JME patients revealed significant fALFF increases in the bilateral medial thalamus, insular cortex/inferior frontal gyrus, and cerebellum vermis (false discovery rate-corrected PÂ <Â 0.05). There was no region of fALFF reduction in JME patients relative to controls. No significant correlation was observed between regional fALFF and disease duration or cumulative number of generalized tonic-clonic seizures.


CONCLUSIONS
We have shown alterations of low-frequency oscillations in the thalamus, insular cortex/inferior frontal gyrus, and cerebellum in patients with JME, implicating cerebello-thalamocortical network abnormality in the pathophysiology underlying JME. Our results could further support the recent concept that JME is a network epilepsy involving specific cortical and subcortical structures, especially the cerebello-thalamocortical network.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ji Park Kim"", ids = ""31508828""); list(name = ""Jung Hoo Kim"", ids = ""5745568""); list(name = ""Sang-Il Suh"", ids = ""145690986"")",,,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,,
28e372815b3a91e4384d1011047b9e8c9620f26b,"Major differences between human atopic dermatitis and murine models, as determined by using global transcriptomic profiling","Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is caused by a complex interplay between immune and barrier abnormalities. Murine models of AD are essential for preclinical assessments of new treatments. Although many models have been used to simulate AD, their transcriptomic profiles are not fully understood, and a comparison of these models with the human AD transcriptomic fingerprint is lacking. Objective: We sought to evaluate the transcriptomic profiles of 6 common murine models and determine how they relate to human AD skin. Methods: Transcriptomic profiling was performed by using microarrays and quantitative RTâ€PCR on biopsy specimens from NC/Nga, flaky tail, Flgâ€mutated, ovalbuminâ€challenged, oxazoloneâ€challenged, and ILâ€23â€“injected mice. Gene expression data of patients with AD, psoriasis, and contact dermatitis were obtained from previous patient cohorts. Criteria of a fold change of 2 or greater and a false discovery rate of 0.05 or less were used for gene arrays. Results: ILâ€23â€“injected, NC/Nga, and oxazoloneâ€challenged mice show the largest homology with our human metaâ€analysisâ€“derived AD transcriptome (37%, 18%, 17%, respectively). Similar to human AD, robust TH1, TH2, and also TH17 activation are seen in ILâ€23â€“injected and NC/Nga mice, with similar but weaker inflammation in ovalbuminâ€challenged mice. Oxazoloneâ€challenged mice show a TH1â€centered reaction, and flaky tail mice demonstrate a strong TH17 polarization. Flgâ€mutated mice display filaggrin downregulation without significant inflammation. Conclusion: No single murine model fully captures all aspects of the AD profile; instead, each model reflects different immune or barrier disease aspects.

4406a4ea9cc265888f75d36d942f0af6c28c8244,Genetic risk for myocardial infarction determined by polymorphisms of candidate genes in a Japanese population.,"BACKGROUND
Although several environmental factors influence the development of myocardial infarction (MI), genetic factors have been shown to contribute to individual susceptibility to this condition.


OBJECTIVE
To identify gene polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to MI in order to allow assessment of genetic risk for this condition.


METHODS
3433 unrelated Japanese people (1931 men, 1502 women) were entered into the study. These comprised 1328 subjects with MI (1036 men, 292 women) and 2105 controls (895 men, 1210 women). The genotypes for 40 polymorphisms of 31 candidate genes were determined with a method that combines PCR and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes with suspension array technology.


RESULTS
The chi(2) test revealed that six polymorphisms were significantly (false discovery rate <0.05) related to the prevalence of MI. Further examination by multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index and the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolaemia, in addition to a stepwise forward selection procedure found that the A-->C (Gln1334His) polymorphism (rs3742207) of the collagen type IV alpha-1 gene (COL4A1) and the A-->G polymorphism (rs4804611) of the zinc finger protein 627 gene (ZNF627) were significantly (p<0.05) associated with the prevalence of MI. The variant C allele of COL4A1 was protective against MI, whereas the variant G allele of ZNF627 represented a risk factor for this condition.


CONCLUSIONS
Determination of genotypes for COL4A1 and ZNF627 may prove informative for assessment of the genetic risk for MI.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711""); list(name = ""Koichi Kato"", ids = ""145463552""); list(name = ""Mitsutoshi Oguri"", ids = ""5005355""); list(name = ""Tetsuo Fujimaki"", ids = ""49996701""); list(name = ""Kiyoshi Yokoi"", ids = ""2332668""); list(name = ""Hirotaka Matsuo"", ids = ""7021857""); list(name = ""Sachirou Watanabe"", ids = ""1805649""); list(name = ""Norifumi Metoki"", ids = ""6157218""); list(name = ""Hiroshi Yoshida"", ids = ""144878938""); list(name = ""Kei Satoh"", ids = ""49245021""); list(name = ""Sahoko Ichihara"", ids = ""143960626""); list(name = ""Yukitoshi Aoyagi"", ids = ""5446851""); list(name = ""Akitomo Yasunaga"", ids = ""49604366""); list(name = ""Harriet Park"", ids = ""31968898""); list(name = ""Masao Tanaka"", ids = ""50698028""); list(name = ""Yoshinori Nozawa"", ids = ""3526189"")",fd7db953784bfcdb202ee961a3c16043c6d4fb72; 550b9696f921717583d06d0025e2c36bea593897; 729a2d40e3ebcf4fdbd12e97993ad4970b18a470; f3aa722ce131ea5aed7371add19022fe0672f59f; ba51f9cafe43127e0a54190513208b11bcc7134b; 309196e4833e0824448a7a30de0596daddea6017; 4f3eed63a37b67468fe41a5aa918c9c40e160add; daa7e117492266abb0600ff56f13ae1a57b765d9; 0a33cde7da92951749cce0a400216dcdced7fdd1; 9a79b71be7d04e878c096f0df0fea69ae9254ff4; 3053cdef14068efb21a2d489f396360e20f01ed8; 730edd7e3310db331c3ed5dab0583993a8c3f5ad; 9b900e976575ff6d79a564c0ac565d184b5fd27a; b15d7507ad215915b0607a80ca51fdbf77b0a272; 7ca8ef5d10f12e07207f42da4a830d7e912c53bb; 7c5ba66ed0a7509e51827724d2e833f740c94479; 9693ef210e0de62447ae0982112ec38c69b558c5; cbe7ba0edf0570be9b46bdf7c8900e0ca01658fc; 4b54b402f135d96caba9c04659765f629cc7400b,,Journal of medical genetics,45 4,"

Metabolic pathways that give rise to functional decline and mobility disability in older adults are incompletely understood.


Methods
To identify metabolic perturbations that may affect functional decline, nontargeted metabolomics was used to measure 350 metabolites in baseline plasma from 313 black men in the Health ABC Study (median age 74 years). Usual gait speed was measured over 20 m. Cross-sectional relationships between gait speed and metabolites were explored with partial correlations adjusted for age, study site, and smoking status. Risk of incident mobility disability (two consecutive reports of severe difficulty walking quarter mile or climb 10 stairs) over 13 years of follow-up was explored with Cox regression models among 307 men who were initially free of mobility disability. Significance was determined at p â‰¤ .01 and q (false discovery rate) â‰¤ 0.30.


Results
Two metabolites were correlated with gait speed: salicylurate (r = -.19) and 2-hydroxyglutarate (r = -.18). Metabolites of amino acids and amino acid degradation (indoxy sulfate; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09-2.03, symmetric dimethylarginine; HR = 3.58, 95% CI = 1.57-8.15, N-carbamoyl beta-alanine; HR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.16-3.14, quinolinate; HR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.65-3.96) and metabolites related to kidney function (aforementioned symmetric dimethylarginine and indoxy sulfate as well as creatinine; HR = 5.91, 95% CI = 2.06-16.9, inositol; HR = 2.70, 95% CI = 1.47-4.97) were among the 23 metabolites associated with incident mobility disability.


Conclusions
This study highlights the potential role of amino acid derivatives and products and kidney function early in the development of mobility disability and suggests metabolic profiles could help identify individuals at risk of functional decline.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rachel A.

341633e41c716658bf50b6105e24fb19955de7e1,Microstructure changes in whiter matter relate to cognitive impairment in Wilsonâ€™s disease,"Purpose: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism with pathological copper accumulation in the brain. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the damaged white matter and the impaired cognitive function in WD patients. Materials and methods: Thirty WD adolescents and thirty age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. All subjects had received brain MRI, including conventional and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) scans. The DTI parameter of fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated by diffusion kurtosis estimator software. The t test was used to compare the differences between two groups. The correlation between cognitive function and whiter matter disorders were analyzed by linear regression. The results of FA parameter and MD parameter intergroup analysis were both corrected with False Discovery Rate (FDR) simulations by SPSS. Results: WD adolescents showed significantly lower scores of time-based prospective memory (TBPM) and verbal fluency test (VFT) compared with HC. We found significantly higher FA in the right thalamus, right lentiform nucleus, left thalamus, left lentiform nucleus, and brain stem in WD adolescents. Besides, WD adolescents exhibited significantly lower FA in right cerebellum and cingulum and left middle frontal lobe compared with controls (P<0.05). There were significantly negative correlations between FA in bilateral lentiform and thalamus and cognitive impairment in WD adolescents (P<0.05). Conclusion: The whiter matter of WD adolescents was impaired and mainly distributed in subcortical brain regions. The impaired cognitive function was affected by the damaged whiter matter.

07987431506d5203ab4d3965d6becc7293ffc85a,Genomic loss of miR-486 regulates tumor progression and the OLFM4 antiapoptotic factor in gastric cancer.,"PURPOSE
MicroRNAs (miRNA) play pivotal oncogenic and tumor-suppressor roles in several human cancers. We sought to discover novel tumor-suppressor miRNAs in gastric cancer (GC).


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Using Agilent miRNA microarrays, we compared miRNA expression profiles of 40 primary gastric tumors and 40 gastric normal tissues, identifying miRNAs significantly downregulated in gastric tumors.


RESULTS
Among the top 80 miRNAs differentially expressed between gastric tumors and normals (false discovery rate < 0.01), we identified hsa-miR-486 (miR-486) as a significantly downregulated miRNA in primary GCs and GC cell lines. Restoration of miR-486 expression in GC cell lines (YCC3, SCH and AGS) caused suppression of several pro-oncogenic traits, whereas conversely inhibiting miR-486 expression in YCC6 GC cells enhanced cellular proliferation. Array-CGH analysis of 106 primary GCs revealed genomic loss of the miR-486 locus in approximately 25% to 30% of GCs, including two tumors with focal genomic losses specifically deleting miR-486, consistent with miR-486 playing a tumor-suppressive role. Bioinformatic analysis identified the secreted antiapoptotic glycoprotein OLFM4 as a potential miR-486 target. Restoring miR-486 expression in GC cells decreased endogenous OLFM4 transcript and protein levels, and also inhibited expression of luciferase reporters containing an OLFM4 3' untranslated region with predicted miR-486 binding sites. Supporting the biological relevance of OLFM4 as a miR-486 target, proliferation in GC cells was also significantly reduced by OLFM4 silencing.


CONCLUSIONS
miR-486 may function as a novel tumor-suppressor miRNA in GC. Its antioncogenic activity may involve the direct targeting and inhibition of OLFM4.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Hue-Kian Oh"", ids = ""119959412""); list(name = ""Angie Lay-Keng Tan"", ids = ""34424140""); list(name = ""Kakoli Das"", ids = ""39776243""); list(name = ""Chia-Huey Ooi"", ids = ""46799216""); list(name = ""Niantao Deng"", ids = ""122246625""); list(name = ""Iain Beehuat Tan"", ids = ""38546955""); list(name = ""Emmanuel Beillard"", ids = ""6407398""); list(name = ""Julian C.

30e4db3148784eb8d5f91aff59332a1801d86b17,Association between genetic polymorphisms and carotid atherosclerosis in patients treated with radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"BackgroundRadiotherapy (RT) of the neck is commonly given to nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients for preventing cervical lymph node metastasis. However, neck RT may induce the development of carotid atherosclerosis. The mechanisms of radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis are still unclear and no previous study has investigated the genetic involvement of radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis. The present study aims to determine the association between genetic polymorphisms and carotid atherosclerosis in patients treated with RT for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.MethodsThe present study recruited 128 post-RT NPC patients. Carotid plaque score was assessed using ultrasonography. Thirteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect the function of anti-atherosclerotic genes, including SOD2, SOD3, CAT, PON1, PPARG, ADIPOQ, IL10, TGFB1 and NOS3, were genotyped. Association between the 13 SNPs and carotid atherosclerosis was evaluated using multiple regression after adjustment for covariates (PLINK). Multiple testing was corrected using Benjamini-Hochberg step-up false discovery rate controlling procedure.Resultsrs662 and rs705379 of PON1 were close to be significantly associated with carotid plaque score (Corrected P value, Pcorâ€‰=â€‰0.0528 and Pcorâ€‰=â€‰0.0842). When the two SNPs were combined together, TC haplotype in rs662-rs705379 of PON1 was significantly associated with higher carotid plaque score (Pcorâ€‰<â€‰0.05). None of the other SNPs showed significant association with carotid plaque score.ConclusionsTC haplotype in rs662-rs705379 of PON1 is likely to be a genetic risk factor of carotid plaque score. Post-RT NPC patients with the TC haplotype may need earlier and more frequent carotid ultrasound examinations for early detection of carotid atherosclerosis.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chuang Yuan"", ids = ""47177262""); list(name = ""Shea Ping Yip"", ids = ""3314137""); list(name = ""Vincent Wc Wu"", ids = ""47252904""); list(name = ""Dora L.W.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the whole-brain volume changes between the patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and the controls using TBM with DARTEL, which could achieve more accurate inter-subject registration of brain images. T1-weighted images were acquired from 21 left-TLE patients, 21 right-TLE patients and 21 healthy controls, which were matched in age and gender. The determinants of the gradient of deformation fields at voxel level were obtained to quantify the expansion or contraction for individual images relative to the template, and then logarithmical transformation was applied on it. A whole brain analysis was performed using general lineal model (GLM), and the multiple comparison was corrected by false discovery rate (FDR) with p<0.05. For left-TLE patients, significant volume reductions were found in hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, precentral gyrus, right temporal lobe and cerebellum. These results potentially support the utility of TBM with DARTEL to study the structural changes between groups.",2009,Psychology; Engineering,"list(name = ""Wenjing Li"", ids = ""50135141""); list(name = ""Huiguang He"", ids = ""40234065""); list(name = ""Jingjing Lu"", ids = ""144829505""); list(name = ""Bin Lv"", ids = ""144628755""); list(name = ""Meng Li"", ids = ""16180490""); list(name = ""Zhengyu Jin"", ids = ""48816874"")",4e860793331153664e7caad2b947fa1f6bc5208d; d962be739ef8089a1fed6cad6d50221c9c1edef5; bba51a2cd417cec45aff6dedf3263f8b3081473e; 71b15de5e0102ff2cf018474b4fec3401b32d4b8,5f378254c528fe56bc7e640d07fb6e35574942a4; 96ef01b391e27a1bf54f5bcb067d56a3c8b673b2; ebd0ff82ffd3093395afb0f32645a43d1c07730f; 2722b2a4702dbbc62742f96c5fbffb7c5b23480f; 775c2d90f3198ae255ce11714b21a45f0775991c; 085029997dab0ac9866d45b4b7de4c02bccfce06; 95599d49087ec44fcf9ccc60a318a25646eaea8c; f78cfb93699e2a1b9517a04664ce87eded0ba104; 2b51e977b7715234d37efc9768983bfe43ddd0b0; 7664e3e9d23c1cd61dc8efc6cec7ec90c6e57c49; a986b7fa2b660577d8f00c2ae01d305ce6dd6bc5; 21b65bbf11bc246a80b7f08043db3ff5c0844e91; 74dd4e64b0236b3c1509754013e5fedeb582a6c2; 249657ee2ddc11947df07a3b321abf3f4df688df; f4a618f18702ffa31b7a7ae79f14db4be7c4a165,,7497,
05a2e5eb8025a147087bb57ac5ae00464dab6d90,Evaluation of a Statistical Equivalence Test Applied to Microarray Data,"Microarray technology is commonly used to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes across conditions. A related issue that has rarely been discussed but is equally important is to identify commonly expressed genes or constantly expressed genes across different organs, tissues, or species. A common practice in the literature for such studies is to apply the differential expression analysis and conclude that a gene is unchanged if there is no statistical evidence to conclude for differential expression. However, genes that are not statistically significantly DE could be (1) truly non-DE genes or (2) truly DE genes not detected by the statistical test of differential expression due to lack of power resulted from high noise level or lack of replication. Therefore, the practice of treating non-statistically significantly DE genes as non-DE genes has the risk of including genes that are truly DE without controlling such errors. We argue that if one wants to identify genes that are truly non-DE, one needs to show statistical evidence through valid statistical tests with the appropriate type I error rate control. In this paper, we consider the identification of non-DE genes through statistical equivalence tests under the framework of multiple testing. In particular, we consider the average equivalence criterion and study the power and false discovery rate (FDR) of the standard average equivalence test, the â€œtwo one-sided testsâ€ (TOST), through extensive simulation studies based on real microarray data sets. We study the effects of various factors that can affect the power and FDR of the equivalence test including the proportion of non-DE genes. We also compare the ROC curves of the equivalence test with those of the naive method of selecting genes that are not statistically significant DE.",2010,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jing Ling Qiu"", ids = ""46392678""); list(name = ""Xiangqin Cui"", ids = ""123007147"")",b099867b37174e3d05e8c19930aec407c3db35bf; 8a97d896e136952ef4e1db5ce0bfced18dcd2238; eb684371c35da18b858b82c19338faa954d35283; f4221a180bb62d3e8c373b41501e677ce53479e1; 02f616785a796c5550c5abae2f5b65464e2d4e20; e746c28675f2ae36e6fb3876f348d14317333d94; ea0378ffb312a69f227f3e1310ead5cf0fdb63da; 65f021598fed48f6483824eb02100d84414d70fe; 2d2fbb9c3e65d620bba860a8776bc2d40ee49ee6; ed68d08ee991ee445c61b05e0f8a392c6a57ca11; c446c61106e1a19c01e44b10b8c26cc277fc94cf; 195b639543102225932edc24005da22400726455,fce7c872d28f93fbf804c417e0876715735cb635; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; 22a9f9bcc02c3117f86768d2633b95340055ce23; 95124346ee368ebdf57e003b1fa6a656beda0344; 8a75052906b675003bfc5011e6b3535cc9651144; 2dec3b5b5a58f48d694e5bb30f9e7387842398a7; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; 7391cb448625fea9888d712e52bdb73f1988abee; 97cc7ab1b0d200d38f802bfc26c7315fb4a07ce3; 89a0e8707e15d0861c72be59853a9e61395c696d; 303b5eee63d270379eba049290898aed29aa7d57; a24b7bf40c967f357e66b00dc7d2141a6966986c; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 053b97e316fc43588e6235f88a1a7a4077342de7; dd52056da025bf9cb344bc8f8f10b5eb182e7cca; eed9e9bb926c3aa3332026ea00615c75bfdc4e22; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; 8c932b33e1287c608d7618c6c30da8dd554e318b; 56f76d7b283fad276eaeaf5a86b3516cbf8c3e68; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 0976d01fc11b500f4c199fae06475b8b526ac4f0; 4ae003c0a447922e2136e96cbd8987b90fbc19e8; 541bc6421a66f4f1fcfb90e1c33c0a67ebc3f639; 056e7774cd48d90dad92fbac784baa1837459aec; 9d824137333ed2a91519f4f51c6f98f1e8234fd6; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; d848d78422260fbdf5ddaf9f21db75f236a52d5f,Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics,20,240 - 266
f143750f724ae3c129edea5face52215ec8f244b,Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and glial integrity: an exploration of associations of cytokines and kynurenine metabolites with symptoms and attention,"BackgroundIn contrast to studies of depression and psychosis, the first part of this study showed no major differences in serum levels of cytokines and tryptophan metabolites between healthy children and those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder of the combined type (ADHD). Yet, small decreases of potentially toxic kynurenine metabolites and increases of cytokines were evident in subgroups. Therefore we examined predictions of biochemical associations with the major symptom clusters, measures of attention and response variability.MethodsWe explored systematically associations of 8 cytokines (indicators of pro/anti-inflammatory function) and 5 tryptophan metabolites with symptom ratings (e.g. anxiety, opposition, inattention) and continuous performance test (CPT) measures (e.g. movement, response time (RT), variability) in 35 ADHD (14 on medication) and 21 control children. Predictions from linear regressions (controlled by the false discovery rate) confirmed or disconfirmed partial correlations accounting for age, body mass and socio-economic status.Results(1) Total symptom ratings were associated with increases of the interleukins IL-16 and IL-13, where relations of IL-16 (along with decreased S100B) with hyperactivity, and IL-13 with inattention were notable. Opposition ratings were predicted by increased IL-2 in ADHD and IL-6 in control children. (2) In the CPT, IL-16 related to motor measures and errors of commission, while IL-13 was associated with errors of omission. Increased RT variability related to lower TNF-Î±, but to higher IFN-Î³ levels. (3) Tryptophan metabolites were not significantly related to symptoms. But increased tryptophan predicted errors of omission, its breakdown predicted errors of commission and kynurenine levels related to faster RTs.ConclusionsMany associations were found across diagnostic groups even though they were more marked in one group. This confirms the quantitative trait nature of these features. Conceptually the relationships of the pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines distinguished between behaviours associated more with cognitive or more with motor control respectively. Further study should extend the number of immunological and metabolic markers to confirm or refute the trends reported here and examine their stability from childhood to adolescence in a longitudinal design.",2009,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Robert D.

82ebeb7b6685f89d7a4a4e76c8c322ad3f4e4f66,On the sample size requirement in genetic association tests when the proportion of false positives is controlled.,"With respect to the multiple-tests problem, recently an increasing amount of attention has been paid to control the false discovery rate (FDR), the positive false discovery rate (pFDR), and the proportion of false positives (PFP). The new approaches are generally believed to be more powerful than the classical Bonferroni one. This article focuses on the PFP approach. It demonstrates via examples in genetic association studies that the Bonferroni procedure can be more powerful than the PFP-control one and also shows the intrinsic connection between controlling the PFP and controlling the overall type I error rate. Since controlling the PFP does not necessarily lead to a desired power level, this article addresses the design issue and recommends the sample sizes that can attain the desired power levels when the PFP is controlled. The results in this article also provide rough guidance for the sample sizes to achieve the desired power levels when the FDR and especially the pFDR are controlled.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Guohua Zou"", ids = ""2406771""); list(name = ""Yijun Zuo"", ids = ""38631491"")",e4b46b39d7c2ee972c05ba48f66c43e8f215a7ac; 32c7e51e89f80170c7579df42834fe9282292068; b852cddaeb1a750781c14174eac46abe216b1621; 4784ad316022a282180435d2ac14db5592222c6d; 3f58b3d6cd9025ca65a5b20900cc99d9859d146e; 1d7413d90c53a5425b5edc79ceadfbe51082ac21; b79cac65ae94a8e33bad2905ba6f3710678b0d02; 6312c9f9408dcb9b7ec2749319e2e9cca2fec7ec; 93a9ecfc597b9171a604a3c0b2b4f17d435799cd; fd32eba2770128d0940240814b100bbf96fae16a,6ebc639349d5f02f87685b948b6858641b921e7a; 165a562c4659cb03b504301454784b8265d7b8f8; ee57efd9343477c09d2351cebcedf834dedd153e; 50b6a37dea80346593c2539245da25291c3678b0; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; bf0695f62bad508f9fc842ddcfdfa2f79c3ff984,Genetics,172 1,"

95f6d843fe8ef09a90d05ae58a698ff6fbb2ddcb,Use of Accelerometer Activity Monitors to Detect Changes in Pruritic Behaviors: Interim Clinical Data on 6 Dogs,"Veterinarians and pet owners have limited ability to assess pruritic behaviors in dogs. This pilot study assessed the capacity of the VetraxÂ® triaxial accelerometer to measure these behaviors in six dogs with pruritus likely due to environmental allergens. Dogs wore the activity monitor for two weeks while consuming their usual pet food (baseline), then for eight weeks while consuming a veterinary-exclusive pet food for dogs with suspected non-food-related skin conditions (Hill's Prescription DietÂ® Derm DefenseTM Canine dry food). Veterinarians and owners completed questionnaires during baseline, phase 1 (days 1-28) and phase 2 (days 29-56) without knowledge of the activity data. Continuous 3-axis accelerometer data was processed using proprietary behavior recognition algorithms and analyzed using general linear mixed models with false discovery rate-adjusted p values. Veterinarian-assessed overall clinical signs of pruritus were significantly predicted by scratching (Î² 0.176, p = 0.008), head shaking (Î² 0.197, p < 0.001) and sleep quality (Î² -0.154, p < 0.001), while owner-assessed quality of life was significantly predicted by scratching (Î² -0.103, p = 0.013) and head shaking (Î² -0.146, p < 0.001). Among dogs exhibiting pruritus signs eating the veterinary-exclusive food, the VetraxÂ® sensor provided an objective assessment of clinically relevant pruritic behaviors that agreed with owner and veterinarian reports.",2018,Engineering; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Susan M.

ff6cf3e0c3f4fc986e4dd3da206d71815700e7be,Su14: Transcriptome Analysis of Wnt7a-mediated Gene Expression in Human Neural Progenitor Cells Derived from Control and Chd8 Haploinsufficient Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,"Background CHD8 (Chromodomain Helicase DNA Binding Protein 8) codes for a member of the CHD family of chromatin-remodeling factors and is one of the most commonly mutated genes in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) identified in exome-sequencing studies. Loss of function mutations in the gene have also been found in Schizophrenia (SZ) and intellectual disabilities. We previously reported RNA-seq analyses carried out on Neural Progenitor Cells (NPCs), monolayer neurons and cerebral organoids derived from control induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cells that were made haploinsufficient for CHD8 (CHD8+/-) using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. Several hundred Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were found in comparisons between the CHD8+/- and isogenic controls (CHD8+/+), including a significant number of ASD and SZ candidate genes, such as the SZ and Bipolar Disorder (BD) candidate gene TCF4. Pathway analysis of DEGs showed enrichment for genes involved in Wnt-signaling. A number of Wnt receptors (members of the FZD family) and Wnt ligands were differentially expressed, such as Wnt7A and its receptor FZD7, which were down-regulated in CHD8+/- NPCs. Methods We tested the hypothesis that Wnt7A-mediated gene expression is deficient in CHD8+/- NPCs by carrying out RNA-seq on two CHD8+/- lines and two controls, including the isogenic control sample. The NPCs were treated with vehicle (control) or Wnt7A (1 microgram/ml) for 24Â hours. Biological duplicates were prepared for each sample. RNA was extracted and converted to cDNA for paired-end sequencing. The RNA-seq reads were aligned to the human genes annotated in the GENCODE database (v18). Gene expression levels were determined as transcripts per million (TPM). Of the 12,898 expressed genes, with an average TPM >1 in either controls or CHD8+/âˆ’ samples, DESeq. 2 was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at false discovery rate [FDR] Results We obtained 892 DEGs in the isogenic control NPCs, from a comparison of the Wnt7A treated samples and controls, but only 410 among the CHD8+/- samples, suggesting a potential reduction in Wnt7A signaling in the CHD8+/- samples. Among the DEGs affected by Wnt7A in the isogenic controls, but not in CHD8+/- samples was TCF4. Pathway analysis showed that DEGs from the isogenic controls were enriched for Wnt-beta catenin signaling pathway and acute phase response signaling. In CHD8+/- NPCs, there was less enrichment of both. RNA-seq findings were confirmed for selected genes by quantitative real time PCR. Discussion These preliminary findings suggest that CHD8 haploinsufficiency can attenuate Wnt7A signaling. Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling plays a key role in brain development and in post-mitotic brain functions. Thus, the attenuation of Wnt7A-inducible genes in CHD8 haploinsufficient NPCs could be mediating some of the effects CHD8 loss-of-function mutations have on brain structures and patient behaviors. Understanding the role of Wnt-signaling on neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders is important because of the insight provided on pathogenesis and from the therapeutic perspective; canonical Wnt-signaling is a target of lithium salts, for example. These preliminary studies are currently being expanded to include three additional control and CHD8+/- NPC lines, and whether gene expression changes are affected by lithium.",2019,Psychology,"list(name = ""Ping Wang"", ids = ""49830707""); list(name = ""Ryan Mokhtari"", ids = ""34898969""); list(name = ""Erika Pedrosa"", ids = ""2887695""); list(name = ""Deyou Zheng"", ids = ""40522750""); list(name = ""Herb Lachman"", ids = ""145141010"")",,,European Neuropsychopharmacology,29,
ca899e7c80096f9cbc5fca1db563e1038df3250b,Tumor HLA-DR expression linked to early intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"The outcome of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor because of the high frequency of intrahepatic recurrence (IHR), particularly early IHR within 1 year of hepatectomy. To search for genes involved in early IHR, we performed DNA microarray analysis in a training set of 33 HCCs and selected 46 genes linked to early IHR from approximately 6,000 genes by means of a supervised learning method. Gene selection was validated by a false discovery rate of 0.37%. The 46 genes included many immune response-related genes, which were all downregulated in HCCs with early IHR. Four of these genes (HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DG and HLA-DQA), encoding MHC class II antigens, were coordinately downregulated in HCCs with early IHR compared to levels in HCCs with nonrecurrence. A cluster analysis reproduced expression patterns of the 4 MHC class II genes in 27 blinded HCC samples. To localize the major site of production of HLA-DR protein in the tumor, we used 50 frozen specimens from 50 HCCs. Immunofluorescence staining showed that HLA-DR protein levels in tumor cells, but not in stromal cells, were associated with the transcription levels of HLA-DRA determined by both DNA microarray analysis and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Univariate analysis showed that tumor HLA-DR protein expression, pTNM stage and venous invasion were associated with early IHR. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor HLA-DR protein expression was one of the independent risk factors for early IHR, suggesting HLA-DR protein potential as a biomarker and a molecular target for therapeutic intervention.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Katsuhiro Matoba"", ids = ""49819712""); list(name = ""Norio Iizuka"", ids = ""1783939""); list(name = ""Toshikazu Gondo"", ids = ""46550954""); list(name = ""Tokuhiro Ishihara"", ids = ""49645479""); list(name = ""Hisafumi Yamada-Okabe"", ids = ""1398842902""); list(name = ""Takao Tamesa"", ids = ""6235292""); list(name = ""Norikazu Takemoto"", ids = ""6191203""); list(name = ""Kiichiro Hashimoto"", ids = ""4526822""); list(name = ""Kazuhiko Sakamoto"", ids = ""145813777""); list(name = ""Takanobu Miyamoto"", ids = ""47234380""); list(name = ""Shunji Uchimura"", ids = ""1798048""); list(name = ""Yoshihiko Hamamoto"", ids = ""1780236""); list(name = ""Masaaki Oka"", ids = ""5069367"")",4c5597ec6604c760fbe3ec009830f0b2378eb8cc; c36ce62ee5931d919852c1439a08e4b5cbaf1ae4; b3a6d4632bbbcd492d07da313b514b2594c71015; d6120da0ad68795a637d40adf35771b790e921ff; 727c457bb932c892e10c84b631f1aaa62a454aa8; 50f324e319cf60433fb9ef44f4f81513b169bd5f; f4d72596f7616d6f652ee9c21ea217428bbc954a; bc56391e813307fa34e0f26f6197a64b4c90bac3; 85b6c122bb2670a11a2ef0e38f90eac1d8223b4f; 61fc9da57503baa62825eb7c9d7bfedf108f48f5; b62c00bed79ab1bbd6727940a43d337beb241a79; a2f717cbd5f652879bea21f356e1581578623266; a304f675906f417d841bf2fc2e4ead7018dddae2; 59308f084abaaaa1de553cb6d093f54ac6293b11; 2eda9bfe341aeb37764fe1841b3101ad220572a5; d9827bc35c2b80ecd59cda0cfa678cf173a1beed; d73d747ef588d0f5ce7b4dd81d09596f6f8a40eb; f662d73cf5eb9a81c193e0977d90af03e61a1098; de90851f6df84c3a533e2132848ee6fb641eb7e1; b28e2c70dd1c50a81f5822b4812fafd49dde72de; 4c287870dd4da90283fa6f8d6fd6fa9d3694126f; 5f744f62287a89133a659f277233884bd8094035; 1a876edb98025440e515c7d36e9f48b0ef79669d; 912c7cdbccf6babe0654e68d94a806b102202066; 1fb84d1820ee79fd2d823bf3d6257df7192ff676; c0676b916f07165b79b0dfc0d18436e0ebe19d58; 8b5f374f5fa600f3cb305a2f2832b5c8fe284b0b; c9e99e9f3b26862193f2cbd60afe3d2acc2c72e1; c44de76aa6e0fcfdab4ce0d5d1c4a4c4f75fcd36; 24faca49c87fca3ea8d75ef6c03606cee7a1299e; 00a6771ee14df1b44292655194da18eebf3188c6,,International journal of cancer,115 2,"

3be1d1f0c1d26c81098094a03810d01d31a90f3c,Non-convex Global Minimization and False Discovery Rate Control for the TREX,"The TREX is a recently introduced method for performing sparse high-dimensional regression. Despite its statistical promise as an alternative to the lasso, square-root lasso, and scaled lasso, the TREX is computationally challenging in that it requires solving a non-convex optimization problem. This paper shows a remarkable result: despite the non-convexity of the TREX problem, there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed to find the global minimum. This result adds the TREX to a very short list of non-convex optimization problems that can be globally optimized (principal components analysis being a famous example). After deriving and developing this new approach, we demonstrate that (i) the ability of the preexisting TREX heuristic to reach the global minimum is strongly dependent on the difficulty of the underlying statistical problem, (ii) the new polynomial-time algorithm for TREX permits a novel variable ranking and selection scheme, (iii) this scheme can be incorporated into a rule that controls the false discovery rate (FDR) of included features in the model. To achieve this last aim, we provide an extension of the results of Barber & Candes (2015) to establish that the knockoff filter framework can be applied to the TREX. This investigation thus provides both a rare case study of a heuristic for non-convex optimization and a novel way of exploiting non-convexity for statistical inference.",2016,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jacob Bien"", ids = ""2154667""); list(name = ""Irina Gaynanova"", ids = ""3393724""); list(name = ""Johannes Lederer"", ids = ""40392235""); list(name = ""Christian L.

e9f68c3f1fdecb8b681e46faaa0e7028fe015987,Rejoinder : On Methods Controlling the False Discovery Rate,"The false discovery rate of Benjamini and Hochberg has a great influence in shaping modern statistical theory. Besides its relevance and utility in contemporary statistical applications, there is mathematical elegance in its theory that is fascinating and has motivated me, just as it it did many others, I am sure, toward its further development and meaningful extension. I try to bring out this elegance in the paper by presenting some important results on FDR with different proofs and insights, in addition to offering a possible extension of the theory of FDR to correlated test statistics. I am delighted to see that the discussants, Professor P. K. Sen and Professors Romano, Shaikh and Wolf, reacted positively to my paper. I thank them for their complimentary and encouraging comments and making interesting observations on how the theory of FDR could potentially be enriched in light of the results presented in the paper. I must, however, mention that there are several other important results on the FDR that I have not been able to present in this paper. Moreover, as Gilles Blanchard has pointed out when I requested him to comment on the final draft of this paper that somewhat similar tools were used independently in other recent papers in proving some of the same results presented here; see Blanchard and Roquain (2008) which has been revised more recently after this paper is written and is avaialable at http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0536.",2009,,"list(name = ""Sanat K.

deab750c3e2b55c222289146de718b87dfd671ec,A general and powerful stage-wise testing procedure for differential expression and differential transcript usage,"Background Reductions in sequencing cost and innovations in expression quantification have prompted an emergence of RNA-seq studies with complex designs and data analysis at transcript resolution. These applications involve multiple hypotheses per gene, leading to challenging multiple testing problems. Conventional approaches provide separate top-lists for every contrast and false discovery rate (FDR) control at individual hypothesis level. Hence, they fail to establish proper gene-level error control, which compromises downstream validation experiments. Tests that aggregate individual hypotheses are more powerful and provide gene-level FDR control, but in the RNA-seq literature no methods are available for post-hoc analysis of individual hypotheses. Results We introduce a two-stage procedure that leverages the increased power of aggregated hypothesis tests while maintaining high biological resolution by post-hoc analysis of genes passing the screening hypothesis. Our method is evaluated on simulated and real RNA-seq experiments. It provides gene-level FDR control in studies with complex designs while boosting power for interaction effects without compromising the discovery of main effects. In a differential transcript usage/expression context, stage-wise testing gains power by aggregating hypotheses at the gene level, while providing transcript-level assessment of genes passing the screening stage. Finally, a prostate cancer case study highlights the relevance of combining gene with transcript level results. Conclusion Stage-wise testing is a general paradigm that can be adopted whenever individual hypotheses can be aggregated.

dcb990af1e0da374762acd6420e6b4a44769201f,Phylogenetic comparative methods complement discriminant function analysis in ecomorphology.,"In ecomorphology, Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) has been used as evidence for the presence of functional links between morphometric variables and ecological categories. Here we conduct simulations of characters containing phylogenetic signal to explore the performance of DFA under a variety of conditions. Characters were simulated using a phylogeny of extant antelope species from known habitats. Characters were modeled with no biomechanical relationship to the habitat category; the only sources of variation were body mass, phylogenetic signal, or random ""noise."" DFA on the discriminability of habitat categories was performed using subsets of the simulated characters, and Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS) was performed for each character. Analyses were repeated with randomized habitat assignments. When simulated characters lacked phylogenetic signal and/or habitat assignments were random, <5.6% of DFAs and <8.26% of PGLS analyses were significant. When characters contained phylogenetic signal and actual habitats were used, 33.27 to 45.07% of DFAs and <13.09% of PGLS analyses were significant. False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrections for multiple PGLS analyses reduced the rate of significance to <4.64%. In all cases using actual habitats and characters with phylogenetic signal, correct classification rates of DFAs exceeded random chance. In simulations involving phylogenetic signal in both predictor variables and predicted categories, PGLS with FDR was rarely significant, while DFA often was. In short, DFA offered no indication that differences between categories might be explained by phylogenetic signal, while PGLS did. As such, PGLS provides a valuable tool for testing the functional hypotheses at the heart of ecomorphology.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""W Andrew Barr"", ids = ""50477063""); list(name = ""Robert S.

6d30c134d4808ea49456baa62374a54e33dc8f9c,ADDIS: an adaptive discarding algorithm for online FDR control with conservative nulls,"Major internet companies routinely perform tens of thousands of A/B tests each year. Such large-scale sequential experimentation has resulted in a recent spurt of new algorithms that can provably control the false discovery rate (FDR) in a fully online fashion. However, current state-of-the-art adaptive algorithms can suffer from a significant loss in power if null p-values are conservative (stochastically larger than the uniform distribution), a situation that occurs frequently in practice. In this work, we introduce a new adaptive discarding method called ADDIS that provably controls the FDR and achieves the best of both worlds: it enjoys appreciable power increase over all existing methods if nulls are conservative (the practical case), and rarely loses power if nulls are exactly uniformly distributed (the ideal case). We provide several practical insights on robust choices of tuning parameters, and extend the idea to asynchronous and offline settings as well.",2019,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jinjin Tian"", ids = ""9509390""); list(name = ""Aaditya Ramdas"", ids = ""2556942"")",4382f7ea8e46f91257b7de6beddc9a8d0eb9f4ff,a7f5ddee3d55d628eae68653dc3b34ffcd2d2075; afc8c291aa589389e6c86407c16a5a646daddaaf; 52afbc1e9c1b16d9365d25ebe7f60bb973282bcb; a0edc4c4b5976be88275ea5834e1d3179513e821; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 83a17e34882c24b4ff407f3e75525631d332df49; ecdfdd8a6cc9a80430e0541f30832c1099e82c15; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 8e835bd75f760f7b0138ce9c73bece4ed69b6f28; e1d8c9d28e2a5275b5d531d678d5544bede3fdee; be14c56689603b297e5429a8fe1ecee695cd77c7; 38bb2fa3dcadf9fad63a0893f42c6d76b34ccb0e,,,9383-9391

To provide therapeutic opportunities we aimed to identify gene transcripts in monocytes that relate to post-MI healing and evaluated intervention with the observed gene activity in a rat MI model. In 51 MI patients treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the change in LV end-diastolic volume index (EDVi) from baseline to 4-month follow-up was assessed using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). Circulating monocytes were collected at day 5 (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol 35:1066â€“1070, 2015; Cell Stem Cell 16:477â€“487, 2015; Curr Med Chem 13:1877â€“1893, 2006) after primary PCI for transcriptome analysis. Transcriptional profiling and pathway analysis revealed that patients with a decreased LV EDVi showed an induction of type I interferon (IFN) signalling (type I IFN pathway: P valueâ€‰<â€‰0.001; false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.001). We subsequently administered 15,000 Units of IFN-Î± subcutaneously in a rat MI model for three consecutive days following MI. Cardiac function was measured using echocardiography and infarct size/cardiac inflammation using (immuno)-histochemical analysis. We found that IFN-Î± application deteriorated ventricular dilatation and increased infarct size at day 28 post-MI. Moreover, IFN-Î± changed the peripheral monocyte subset distribution towards the pro-inflammatory monocyte subset whereas in the myocardium, the presence of the alternative macrophage subset was increased at day 3 post-MI. Our findings suggest that induction of type I IFN signalling in human monocytes coincides with adverse LV remodelling. In rats, however, IFN-Î± administration deteriorated post-MI healing. These findings underscore important but also contradictory roles for the type I IFN response during cardiac healing following MI.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ellis N Ter Horst"", ids = ""3585659""); list(name = ""Paul A.

Methods: Balb/c mice were intravenously injected with 13 to 260 kBq of 131 I and euthanized 24 h after injection. Kidneys, liver, lungs, and spleen were surgically removed. The absorbed dose to the tissues was 0.1 to 9.7 mGy. Total RNA was extracted, and Illumina MouseRef-8 Whole-Genome Expression BeadChips (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, USA) were used to compare the gene expression of the irradiated tissues to that of non-irradiated controls. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to determine differentially expressed transcripts and control for false discovery rate. Only transcripts with a modulation of 1.5-fold or higher, either positively or negatively regulated, were included in the analysis. Results: The number of transcripts affected ranged from 260 in the kidney cortex to 857 in the lungs. The majority of the affected transcripts were specific for the different absorbed doses delivered, and few transcripts were shared between the different tissues investigated. The response of the transcripts affected at all dose levels was generally found to be independent of dose, and only a few transcripts showed increasing or decreasing regulation with increasing absorbed dose. Few biological processes were affected at all absorbed dose levels studied or in all tissues studied. The types of biological processes affected were clearly tissue-dependent. Immune response was the only biological process affected in all tissues, and processes affected in more than three tissues were primarily associated with the response to stimuli and metabolism. Conclusion: Despite the low absorbed doses delivered to the tissues investigated, a surprisingly strong response was observed. Affected biological processes were primarily associated with the normal function of the tissues, and only small deviations from the normal metabolic activity in the tissues were induced.",2011,Biology,"list(name = ""Emil SchÃ¼ler"", ids = ""39841072""); list(name = ""Toshima Z.

Identifying genes that regulate neuroblastoma metabolism and also influence clinical behavior may provide clues for novel therapeutic targets. Mixed linear models were used to identify differentially expressed genes between neuroblastoma cells grown in hypoxia or normoxia in two independent experiments (GEO accessions GSE17714 and GSE55391). Linear models were also used in to identify differentially expressed genes from tumors of two independent cohorts of neuroblastoma patients (GEO accession GSE16254 and EMBL accession E-MTAB-179) who survived compared to those that did not. We utilized a false discovery rate of 0.01 and fold change in the top or bottom 10% of all genes as a significance cutoff. qPCR was used to validate expression differences in multiple neuroblastoma cell lines. 157 genes, significantly exceeding chance (p -6 ) on permutation testing, were present in both neuroblastoma cell line data sets, all but five of which showed consistent directionality of expression change from normoxia to hypoxia, including 44 involved in metabolism. These genes were enriched for hypoxia and metabolic pathways: HIF-1Î± transcription factor network (p = 1.3x10 -11 ), glycolysis (p = 1.9x10 -8 ) and fructose metabolism (p = 1.0x10 -3 ). 826 genes, significantly exceeding chance (p -6 ) were differentially expressed in both patient cohorts of 478 and 88 patients. These genes were enriched for cell cycle pathways (p = 4.5x10 -7 ). Of these genes, nine of them were also differentially expressed in hypoxia compared to normoxia with consistent directionality, again more than expected by chance (p -6 ). High expression in eight of the nine genes was also significantly associated with poor outcome in a Kaplan-Meier analysis of both of the patient cohorts evaluated. Three of these genes are part of the glycolytic pathway and three more are directly involved in cellular metabolism. In the SK-N-BE2 cell line, all eight of our identified genes are up-regulated in hypoxia (p Citation Format: Mark A.

bf01ce600f37b344060f08b5f67b17f556a0f5d9,Death Receptor (DR4) Haplotypes Are Associated with Increased Susceptibility of Gallbladder Carcinoma in North Indian Population,"BACKGROUND AND AIM
Defective apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer development and progression. Death receptors (DR4, FAS) and their ligands (TRAIL, FASL) are thought to mediate the major extrinsic apoptotic pathway in the cell. SNPs in these genes may lead to defective apoptosis. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the association of functional SNPs of DR4 (rs20575, rs20576 and rs6557634), FAS (rs2234767) and FASL (rs763110) with gallbladder cancer (GBC) risk.


METHODS
This case-control study included 400 GBC and 246 healthy controls (HC). Genotyping was carried out by Taqman genotyping assays. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS ver16. Meta-analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis software (Version 2.0, BIOSTAT, Englewood, NJ) to systematically summarize the possible association of SNP with cancer risk. Functional prediction of these variants was carried out using Bioinformatics tools (FAST-SNP, F-SNP). False discovery rate (FDR test) was used in multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
The DR4 C rs20575 A rs20576 A rs6557634, G rs20575 A rs20576 G rs6557634 and G rs20575 C rs20576 G rs6557634 haplotypes conferred two-fold increased risk for GBC. Among these, the DR4 C rs20575 A rs20576 A rs6557634 haplotype emerged as main factor influencing GBC susceptibility as the risk was not modulated by gender or gallstone stratification. Our meta-analysis results showed significant association of DR4 rs6557634 with overall cancer risk, GI cancers as well as in Caucasians. We didn't find any association of FAS and FASL SNPs with GBC susceptibility.


CONCLUSIONS
The DR4 haplotype C rs20575 A rs20576 A rs6557634 represents an important factor accounting the patients susceptibility to GBC probably due to decreased apoptosis. However, additional well-designed studies with larger sample size focusing on different ethnicities are required to further validate the results.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Rajani Rai"", ids = ""6714453""); list(name = ""Kiran Lata Sharma"", ids = ""32595138""); list(name = ""Surbhi Sharma"", ids = ""152763227""); list(name = ""Sanjeev Misra"", ids = ""50055606""); list(name = ""Anil R.

abdf393448a2de081862d161b4bac3c0adb9185e,Radiomics features on non-contrast computed tomography predict early enlargement of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage,"OBJECTIVE
To explore the value of radiomics features on non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) in predicting early enlargement of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
167 patients with SICH were divided into enlarged hematoma and non-enlarged hematoma groups based on the volume of hematoma on 24-h follow-up CT images > 30% and/or 6â€¯ml of the baseline NCCT. The baseline NCCT images of all cases were imported into radiomics software to extract the radiomics features of the initial hematoma. For each case, the features with good predictability were retained after the feature-selected process; the remaining features were used to construct model with 23 algorithms one-by-one. A 5-fold method was used to cross-validate the model and repeated 5 times. The algorithm model with the highest accuracy was selected as predictive model for hematoma enlargement (HE) in SICH, its average parameters including AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), false positive rate (FPR), false negative rate (FNR),and false discovery rate (FDR) were taken as evaluating indicators.


RESULTS
A total of 1227 texture features of each cerebral hematoma were obtained. After the feature-selected process, 4 features (wavelet-LHL mean, wavelet-LLL _ Idm, wavelet-LLL _run length non-uniformity normalized, and wavelet-LLL _contrast) remained to construct the predictive models. Among 23 model algorithms, Linear Support Vector Classifier showed the highest accuracy (72.6%), and eventually was selected as the predictive model, its AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, PPV, NPV, FPR, FNR, and FDR were 0.729, 0.726,0.717,0.736,0.714, 0.736, 0.741, 0.264, 0.283 and 0.264, respectively.


CONCLUSION
Radiomics features of cerebral hematoma on baseline NCCT images showed good performance in predicting HE of SICH.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hui Li"", ids = ""29488888""); list(name = ""Yuan-liang Xie"", ids = ""46268948""); list(name = ""Xiang Wang"", ids = ""122024492""); list(name = ""Faxiang Chen"", ids = ""81424401""); list(name = ""Xiaoli Jiang"", ids = ""48324851"")",,,Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery,185,
6158ca8a177410c5e4d5224bb2b8adf8cb92c491,Incorporating spatial dependence into Bayesian multiple testing of statistical parametric maps in functional neuroimaging,"The analysis of functional neuroimaging data often involves the simultaneous testing for activation at thousands of voxels, leading to a massive multiple testing problem. This is true whether the data analyzed are time courses observed at each voxel or a collection of summary statistics such as statistical parametric maps (SPMs). It is known that classical multiplicity corrections become strongly conservative in the presence of a massive number of tests. Some more popular approaches for thresholding imaging data, such as the Benjamini-Hochberg step-up procedure for false discovery rate control, tend to lose precision or power when the assumption of independence of the data does not hold. Bayesian approaches to large scale simultaneous inference also often rely on the assumption of independence. We introduce a spatial dependence structure into a Bayesian testing model for the analysis of SPMs. By using SPMs rather than the voxel time courses, much of the computational burden of Bayesian analysis is mitigated. Increased power is demonstrated by using the dependence model to draw inference on a real dataset collected in a fMRI study of cognitive control. The model also is shown to lead to improved identification of neural activation patterns known to be associated with eye movement tasks.",2014,Computer Science; Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""D.

0dcc3ab2da10ea56f21f732afc92990360d167dc,Detection of Lane-Change Events in Naturalistic Driving Videos,"Lane changes are important behaviors to study in driving research. Automated detection of lane-change events is required to address the need for data reduction of a vast amount of naturalistic driving videos. This paper presents a method to deal with weak lane-marker patterns as small as a couple of pixels wide. The proposed method is novel in its approach to detecting lane-change events by accumulating lane-marker candidates over time. Since the proposed method tracks lane markers in temporal domain, it is robust to low resolution and many different kinds of interferences. The proposed technique was tested using 490 h of naturalistic driving videos collected from 63 drivers. The lane-change events in a 10-h video set were first manually coded and compared with the outcome of the automated method. The method's sensitivity was 94.8% and the data reduction rate was 93.6%. The automated procedure was further evaluated using the remaining 480-h driving videos. The data reduction rate was 97.4%. All 4971 detected events were manually reviewed and classified as either true or false lane-change events. Bootstrapping showed that the false discovery rate from the larger data set was not significantly different from that of the 10-h manually coded data set. This study demonstrated that the temporal processing of lane markers is an effcient strategy for detecting lane-change events involving weak lane-marker patterns in naturalistic driving.",2018,Mathematics; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Shuhang Wang"", ids = ""49185004""); list(name = ""Brian R.

ecf9b2bde2caa87eefc3cd98d4bc8331a336fc35,Loss of Functional Connectivity in Patients with Parkinson Disease and Visual Hallucinations.,"Purpose To gain more insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of visual hallucinations (VHs) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) by analyzing whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity in PD patients with VH (hereafter, referred to as PD + VH patients) and without VH (hereafter, referred to as PD - VH patients) and control participants. Materials and Methods For this retrospective study, 15 PD + VH patients, 40 PD - VH patients, and 15 control participants from a prospective cohort study were included, which was approved by the local ethics board and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Functional connectivity was calculated between 47 regions of interests, of which whole-brain and region-specific means were compared by using a general linear model with false discovery rate control for multiple comparisons. Results Whole-brain mean functional connectivity was significantly lower in PD patients compared with control participants, with regional decreases involving paracentral and occipital regions in both PD + VH and PD - VH patients (mean whole-brain functional connectivity in PD + VH vs PD - VH, 0.12 Â± 0.01 [standard deviation] vs 0.14 Â± 0.03, respectively; control participants, 0.15 Â± 0.04; P < .05, corrected). In PD + VH patients, nine additional frontal, temporal, occipital, and striatal regions showed decreased functional connectivity compared with control participants (mean of these nine regions in PD + VH, PD - VH, and control participants: 0.12 Â± 0.02, 0.14 Â± 0.03, and 0.16 Â± 0.04, respectively; P < .05, corrected). Resting-state functional connectivity was unrelated to motor performance (r = 0.182; P = .184) and related to cognitive deficits such as attention and perception (Ï, -0.555 and -0.558, respectively; P < .05). Conclusion The findings show a PD-related effect on resting-state functional connectivity of posterior and paracentral brain regions, whereas the presence of VH is associated with a more global loss of connectivity, related to attention and perception. These findings suggest that the pathophysiological mechanisms of VH in PD may include a global loss of network efficiency, which could drive disturbed attentional and visual processing.

631fe3da480f8d903f574cfb89f6d06c1cef6947,A survey of computational methods and error rate estimation procedures for peptide and protein identification in shotgun proteomics.,"This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of the peptide and protein identification process using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data generated in shotgun proteomic experiments. The commonly used methods for assigning peptide sequences to MS/MS spectra are critically discussed and compared, from basic strategies to advanced multi-stage approaches. A particular attention is paid to the problem of false-positive identifications. Existing statistical approaches for assessing the significance of peptide to spectrum matches are surveyed, ranging from single-spectrum approaches such as expectation values to global error rate estimation procedures such as false discovery rates and posterior probabilities. The importance of using auxiliary discriminant information (mass accuracy, peptide separation coordinates, digestion properties, and etc.) is discussed, and advanced computational approaches for joint modeling of multiple sources of information are presented. This review also includes a detailed analysis of the issues affecting the interpretation of data at the protein level, including the amplification of error rates when going from peptide to protein level, and the ambiguities in inferring the identifies of sample proteins in the presence of shared peptides. Commonly used methods for computing protein-level confidence scores are discussed in detail. The review concludes with a discussion of several outstanding computational issues.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Alexey I.

418394cab8105527ffbef8276bef05b1be3baf55,The impact of Staphylococcus aureus genomic variation on clinical phenotype of children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis,"Background
Children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) have a broad spectrum of illness ranging from mild to severe. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of genomic variation of Staphylococcus aureus on clinical phenotype of affected children and determine which virulence genes correlate with severity of illness.


Methods
De novo whole genome sequencing was conducted for a strain of Community Acquired Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), using PacBio Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process (HGAP) from 6 Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) Cells, as a reference for DNA library assembly of 71 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from children with AHO. Virulence gene annotation was based on exhaustive literature review and genomic data in NCBI for Staphylococcus aureus. Clinical phenotype was assessed using a validated severity score. Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test determined association between clinical severity and virulence gene presence using False Discovery Rate (FDR), significance <0.01.


Results
PacBio produced an assembled genome of 2,898,306 bp and 2054 Open Reading Frames (ORFs). Annotation confirmed 201 virulence genes. Statistical analysis of gene presence by clinical severity found 40 genes significantly associated with severity of illness (FDR â‰¤0.009). MRSA isolates encoded a significantly greater number of virulence genes than did MSSA (p < 0.0001). Phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood (PAML) demonstrated the relatedness of genomic distance to clinical phenotype.


Conclusions
The Staphylococcus aureus genome contains virulence genes which are significantly associated with severity of illness in children with osteomyelitis. This study introduces a novel reference strain and detailed annotation of Staphylococcus aureus virulence genes. While this study does not address bacterial gene expression, a platform is created for future transcriptome investigations to elucidate the complex mechanisms involved in childhood osteomyelitis.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Angela C Collins"", ids = ""50593426""); list(name = ""Edward K.

edc5acbd219e29be2a380589522707d477a1ab74,Maturing interactions,"The maturation of large-scale protein-protein interaction methodologies calls for improved methods to assess performance and data quality. In December 2006 we published a special issue dedicated to protein-protein interaction (PPI) methods. Now almost exactly two years later, we again present a collection of research papers on this subject. The differences between then and now are noteworthy. Just as sequencing has matured from a method targeted at individual genes to the present-day whole-genome efforts, PPI studies are shifting to proteome-wide experiments. Reflecting this shift, the papers in this issue deal with large-scale interaction studies and have the ultimate goal of determining the complete interactomes of organisms. But what will this require? Tellingly, a central emerging theme is the importance of evaluating the quality of interactions in large-scale datasets. As part of its maturation, sequencing technology required adjustments in its methods for quality control. But for sequenc-ing, the desired quality was easy to define and relatively easy to obtain, whereas data quality for PPI experiments is harder to measure , and defining a finished interactome is more challenging. The data analysis methods described in the reports on pages 83 and 91 in this issue are an important step forward in the empirical assessment of PPI data quality. The positive and negative human PPI reference sets they provide are an experimentally testable open resource for quantifying the performance of PPI screens, and we hope these will be built upon and used by others. Just as the report on page 47 provides comparable reference datasets for Caenorhabditis elegans, it will be important to define reference sets for other organisms. The size of these datasets is ambitious but still small relative to the scale of the task at hand; care must therefore be exercised in their use. The negative reference set, for example, is too small to directly measure the false positive rate and false discovery rate of PPI assays. In addition to providing empirical confidence assessments of PPI data, these quality measures allow estimation of total interactome size. Unfortunately, size estimates provide only a partial picture of the total experimental effort required to map an interactome. Modeling of various experimental strategies, as done on page 55, is therefore important for determining the magnitude of the mapping task ahead and how best to minimize the effort required for its completion. The results of this mod-eling show that probability thresholdingï£§where each interaction is assigned an evidence-based â€¦",2009,,,75df4df8b2a41a201c75743261663407679ba4c2; f40dc24042f7ddf9ffc5667b1356157c7d76208a,,Nature Methods,6,2-2

To clarify the pathogenesis of fibrosis in inflammatory orbital diseases, we analysed the gene expression in orbital biopsies and compared our results with those reported for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.


METHODS
We collected 140 biopsies from 138 patients (58 lacrimal glands; 82 orbital fat). Diagnoses included healthy controls (n=27), non-specific orbital inflammation (NSOI) (n=61), thyroid eye disease (TED) (n=29), sarcoidosis (n=14) and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (n=7). Fibrosis was scored on a 0-3 scale by two experts, ophthalmic pathologists. Gene expression was quantified using Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 microarray.


RESULTS
Within orbital fat, fibrosis was greatest among subjects with GPA (2.75Â±0.46) and significantly increased in tissue from subjects with GPA, NSOI or sarcoidosis (p<0.01), but not for TED, compared with healthy controls (1.13Â±0.69). For lacrimal gland, the average score among controls (1.36Â±0.48) did not differ statistically from any of the four disease groups. Seventy-three probe sets identified transcripts correlating with fibrosis in orbital fat (false discovery rate <0.05) after accounting for batch effects, disease type, age and sex. Transcripts with increased expression included fibronectin, lumican, thrombospondin and collagen types I and VIII, each of which has been reported upregulated in pulmonary fibrosis.


CONCLUSIONS
A pathologist's recognition of fibrosis in orbital tissue correlates well with increased expression of transcripts that are considered essential in fibrosis. Many transcripts implicated in orbital fibrosis have been previously implicated in pulmonary fibrosis. TED differs from other causes of orbital fat inflammation because fibrosis is not a major component. Marked fibrosis is less common in the lacrimal gland compared with orbital adipose tissue.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""James T.

eec19e55ada1ea38b648295e684cd7f9ae139154,Diet and lifestyle factors associated with miRNA expression in colorectal tissue,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. Diet and lifestyle factors have been hypothesized to be involved in the regulation of miRNA expression. In this study it was hypothesized that diet and lifestyle factors are associated with miRNA expression. Data from 1,447 cases of colorectal cancer to evaluate 34 diet and lifestyle variables using miRNA expression in normal colorectal mucosa as well as for differential expression between paired carcinoma and normal tissue were used. miRNA data were obtained using an Agilent platform. Multiple comparisons were adjusted for using the false discovery rate q-value. There were 250 miRNAs differentially expressed between carcinoma and normal colonic tissue by level of carbohydrate intake and 198 miRNAs differentially expressed by the level of sucrose intake. Of these miRNAs, 166 miRNAs were differentially expressed for both carbohydrate intake and sucrose intake. Ninety-nine miRNAs were differentially expressed by the level of whole grain intake in normal colonic mucosa. Level of oxidative balance score was associated with 137 differentially expressed miRNAs between carcinoma and paired normal rectal mucosa. Additionally, 135 miRNAs were differentially expressed in colon tissue based on recent NSAID use. Other dietary factors, body mass index, waist and hip circumference, and long-term physical activity levels did not alter miRNA expression after adjustment for multiple comparisons. These results suggest that diet and lifestyle factors regulate miRNA level. They provide additional support for the influence of carbohydrate, sucrose, whole grains, NSAIDs, and oxidative balance score on colorectal cancer risk.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Martha L.

8a5caead87b0ed89d226e034fee1faf686576dc5,Gene Expression Analysis of Leukemic Blasts Persisting at Day 8 of Induction Therapy in Childhood ALL.,"In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), early response to therapy is of crucial prognostic significance. In the frontline ALL-BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) trial, treatment stratification is based on blast count estimation in peripheral blood at day 8 of induction prephase with prednisone and one dose of intrathecal methotrexate at day 1. To approach yet unknown mechanisms of therapy resistance and to characterize cells persisting under therapy on molecular level, we investigated gene expression profiles of leukemic blasts at day 8 of therapy (â€œday 8â€ cells) and their changes as compared with blast cells at initial diagnosis (â€œday 0â€ cells). To this end, an experimental procedure has been established including flow sorting of leukemic cells by their leukemia-associated immunophenotype and preparation of cRNA, starting from a small number of cells and using an additional amplification step. Experiments have shown that flow sorting procedure does not affect RNA quality, and this experimental approach facilitates investigation of patient samples with blast cell counts as low as 50 blast cells/Î¼l. Blast cells from ten patients with B-cell precursor ALL were investigated using Affymetrix HG U133A microarrays, and gene expression data were processed by normalization procedure on probe level by variance stabilization. Genes commonly up- or downregulated in blast cells under therapy were identified in matched pairs of day 8 and day 0 samples using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and a filtering criterion of at least two-fold mean change. By this procedure a group of 84 genes with a false discovery rate of less than 10 % was identified. In this group, 24 genes, reportedly involved at different levels of the cell cycle regulation, including cell cycle progression (CDC2, cyclin B2), DNA replication (e.g. thymidylate synthetase TYMS, ribonucleotide reductase RRM2, proteins MCM 4 and 6) and execution of mitosis (e.g. cell cycle checkpoint kinases CHEK1 and BUB1B, kinesin-like proteins 1 and 7, and MAD2L1), were found to be downregulated in the day 8 cells. In contrast, genes (n=7) encoding for proteins involved in survival signaling (e.g. IL-4/IL-13 common receptor chain, membrane-spanning 4-domains MS4A1 and CD20) showed increased expression in day 8 blasts. Taken together, the described experimental approach enabled gene expression analysis of ALL cells persisting under therapy and pointed to increased survival signaling in day 8 blasts and their preferential positioning in the G1 cell cycle phase.",2004,Biology,"list(name = ""Peter Rhein"", ids = ""2184125""); list(name = ""Richard Ratei"", ids = ""2864648""); list(name = ""Stefanie Scheid"", ids = ""2179040""); list(name = ""Christian Hagemeier"", ids = ""5018679""); list(name = ""Karl Dr. Seeger"", ids = ""46932169""); list(name = ""Renate Kirschner"", ids = ""152838314""); list(name = ""Martin Schrappe"", ids = ""49944905""); list(name = ""Rainer Spang"", ids = ""48692032""); list(name = ""W. -D.

Background: CRC, a leading cause of death, is curable if detected early. There is an unmet need for an accurate, noninvasive biomarker of CRC. MiRNAs are nonâ€“protein-coding RNAs regulating gene expression that play a role in CRC development. Methods: Levels of 380 miRNAs were determined using microfluidic array technology (Applied Biosystems) in a â€œtrainingâ€ set of 30 CRC patients from whom cancer and adjacent normal tissue were collected. The 4 most dysregulated miRNAs (P < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR): 10%) were then validated in a second blinded â€œtestâ€ set of 16 CRC patients from whom cancer and normal adjacent tissue had been collected. Validated tissue miRNAs were then evaluated in a plasma â€œtestâ€ set consisting of 30 CRC patients and 30 individuals without CRC. The most dysregulated tissue miRNAs were then validated in an independent new plasma test set consisting of 20 CRC patients with 20 age-, -, and race-matched subjects without CRC. Results: Nineteen of 380 miRNAs were dysregulated in CRC tissue in the tissue â€œtrainingâ€ set (P < 0.05, FDR: 10%). The 2 most upregulated (miR-31; miR-135b) and most downregulated (miR-1; miR-133a) miRNAs identified CRC in our â€œtestâ€ set with 100% sensitivity and 80% specificity. MiR-31 was more upregulated in stages III and IV compared with stages I and II (P < 0.05).

db29ac93596b077811e9d397fefb7c31973b6c4d,Analysis of differentially expressed genes in colorectal adenocarcinoma with versus without metastasis by three-dimensional oligonucleotide microarray.,"BACKGROUND
Our objective was to examine how the gene expression profile of tumor tissue correlates with lymph node metastasis in patients with advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRAC).


METHODS
We studied 36 patients (20 men and 16 women, 22-90 years of age) treated for CRAC (classifications of T2, T3, or T4; histological grade of G1 or G2). Amplified tumor mRNA samples were exposed to 20,000 human sequence probes and digitized images of the hybridized samples were analyzed.


RESULTS
On average, 2389 probes were detected above the background, with an average correlation R value of 0.19 between data from different patient groups (with or without lymph node invasion, colon or rectal, with or without angio-lymphatic invasion, with or without recurrence). Lymph node metastasis had a statistically significant signature according to Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and parametric t-tests, with a false discovery rate (FDR)=0.1% and p=0.001, respectively. Cross-correlation of these two tests identified 102 transcripts as being potentially related to node metastases, with fold changes in the range of 2.182-12.960.


CONCLUSION
We identified 102 differentially expressed genes related to the presence of lymph node metastases in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rita M A M Moura Franco"", ids = ""14368816""); list(name = ""Marcelo Moura Linhares"", ids = ""3954355""); list(name = ""Suzana AngÃ©lica Silva Lustosa"", ids = ""143739389""); list(name = ""Ismael Dcg Silva"", ids = ""144875600""); list(name = ""Naiara CorrÃªa Nogueira de Souza"", ids = ""48780901""); list(name = ""Delcio Matos"", ids = ""1803304"")",c09805ee5b2a9f331df9be9dccfb3b0655c7f6c9,f63521eb2e6275d55b93db385df442b4662548f2; 54299ed3cf042616dc5660e285ef22dc3868fae2; 364acf4182a18738d20e4afc41ceb8116742dda4; e91d0be226785bf10d7f30a7636fd2079fd33498; 0dc0e762681232e72da39f59f7cac1474552e360; d6ec5472aa8bb05d93b62d5f91c8d8ab242529fd; 736ff8015d96bfecbbfdda20c9a7aef68eab0f68; 56feb91e678f6a45afbcff0e9db6f079b5a5fdf2; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 2986a7391482f3ee1c29d371b79d14fbeef72f2c; 68c56990d69b58a4bbd4898a673a4f305c6a8ad0; 9657509846048f8193b20f51a1da8dd38b3bdf54; 2d3e6f0aeffa552d45d1ead5cec830283cc9aad1; 460bc5461711b9dec056438a9197c4565bcc8cfb,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,7 1,"

It thresholds an appropriate test statistic and reports the q-value of each test based on a set of sample permutations. SAM works as a Microsoft Excel add-in and has additional features for fold-change thresholding and block permutations. Here, we explain how the SAM methodology works in the context of a general approach to detecting differential gene expression in DNA microarrays. Some recently developed methodology for estimating false discovery rates and q-values has been included in the SAM software, which we summarize here.",2003,Biology,"list(name = ""John M. D.

b57c155f71cf56cf1a5da09fd543b2ffea26030c,Metabolites Associated with Vigor to Frailty Among Community-Dwelling Older Black Men,"Black versus white older Americans are more likely to experience frailty, a condition associated with adverse health outcomes. To reduce racial disparities in health, a complete understanding of the pathophysiology of frailty is needed. Metabolomics may further our understanding by characterizing differences in the body during a vigorous versus frail state. We sought to identify metabolites and biological pathways associated with vigor to frailty among 287 black men ages 70-81 from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, 350 metabolites were measured in overnight-fasting plasma. The Scale of Aging Vigor in Epidemiology (SAVE) measured vigor to frailty based on weight change, strength, energy, gait speed, and physical activity. Thirty-seven metabolites correlated with SAVE scores (p < 0.05), while adjusting for age and site. Fourteen metabolites remained significant after multiple comparisons adjustment (false discovery rate < 0.30). Lower values of tryptophan, methionine, tyrosine, asparagine, C14:0 sphingomyelin, and 1-methylnicotinamide, and higher values of glucoronate, N-carbamoyl-beta-alanine, isocitrate, creatinine, C4-OH carnitine, cystathionine, hydroxyphenylacetate, and putrescine were associated with frailer SAVE scores. Pathway analyses identified nitrogen metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and the citric acid cycle. Future studies need to confirm these SAVE-associated metabolites and pathways that may indicate novel mechanisms involved in the frailty syndrome.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Megan M Marron"", ids = ""6859062""); list(name = ""Tamara B.

cf4a9c861baa72b0392a44a19fca9d7594d7bf9a,Su18: Investigating Shrinkage Methods to Improve Accuracy of Gwas and Prs Effect Size Estimates,"Background As the scale and power of GWAS have increased to detect the small genetic effect sizes involved in complex polygenic traits, the results of GWAS, especially SNP effect size estimates, are increasingly utilised for prediction. A popular approach is the application of Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS). However, the effect size estimates are inherently prone to overfit the specific samples on which the GWAS were performed (e.g. â€œthe Winner's Curseâ€). The inflation of effect size estimation reduces the out-of-sample accuracy of prediction based on GWAS results. Many shrinkage methods have been developed to correct for such inflation. As GWAS results and large individual genotype data sets become widely available, there is greater opportunity to accurately evaluate effect size inflation and compare the performance of different shrinkage methods. Methods We develop a novel permutation-based shrinkage method and compare its performance with previously developed methods based on local false discovery rate and the LASSO. We evaluate the performance of the methods across a wide range of phenotypes and investigate different factors (e.g. phenotype heritability) that influence their impact on the predictive power of polygenic risk scores. Results Using large-scale real genotype data, we show that SNP effect sizes are markedly overfit even in relatively large samples, but that our permutation-based shrinkage approach can improve PRS prediction dramatically. Discussion Our results suggest that GWAS results can be adjusted using an efficient empirical approach to provide more accurate effect size estimates and thus greater downstream predictive power. This approach could be applied to a wide variety of big data settings.",2019,Psychology,"list(name = ""Yunfeng Ruan"", ids = ""35173596""); list(name = ""Shing Wan Choi"", ids = ""10796703""); list(name = ""Paul F.

e0b09cefa02ee905942eb6cda087736f597d8461,Dynamic Gene Expression Profile Changes in Synovial Fluid Following Meniscal Injury; Osteoarthritis (OA) Markers Found,"Purpose: We hypothesize that molecular changes leading to Osteoarthritis (OA) occur soon after a meniscal tear and long before the manifestation of OA. We sought to characterize the gene expression profile in synovial fluid at different time points following a meniscal tear with a focused examination on inflammatory and arthritis related genetic markers. Methods: Synovial fluid was collected from 8 male patients (24~48yrs old) with evidence of meniscal injury on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Illumina humanht-12 microarray and RNA-Seq were used to characterize gene expression profile in cell pellets and supernatant, respectively. Unsupervised clustering analysis was performed to identify patterns of gene expression profile among samples. Metacore was utilized to perform pathway analysis. T-tests with False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrections were used to compare subset of genes among individuals. Results: Individuals with short injury duration (< 2 months) had distinct expression signatures than the rest, in both cell pellet and supernatant analyses. In the cell pellets, among genes previously linked to inflammatory or arthritic conditions, IL 1B, IL1RN, ILF2, NFKB1, IL10RB, IL18BP, ILF3, IL13RA, BMP2K and IL10RB were significantly upregulated (adjusted p < 0.05) in individuals with long duration compared to individuals with shorter injury duration in the microarray analysis. In the cell-free supernatant, 764 RNA species were identified and 65 RNA species were down-regulated and 78 RNA species were up-regulated (FDR < 0.05) in individuals with short compared to individuals with long injury duration. The most differentially expressed gene in the supernatant is SLC2A9 (P = 1.2x10-13; FDR = 9.6x10-11). In the cell pellet, the top 5% expressed genes are enriched for inflammatory and cytoskeleton remodeling pathways. Among them LAIR 1, TMSB4X, CCR6, IL18 and IL10; all have been implicated in arthritic conditions. Conclusions: Molecular changes contributing to OA development occur earlier than previously described and potentially evolve or change over time. Clinical Relevance: Our data suggest the potential for early interventions to halt detrimental molecular changes following meniscal injury, thereby reducing the susceptibility of patients to OA following a meniscal tear.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Danica D.

7478c077f6f61a82292ec4d9cbe1af9e71537a08,Detection of gene copy number changes in CGH microarrays using a spatially correlated mixture model,"MOTIVATION
Comparative genomic hybridization array experiments that investigate gene copy number changes present new challenges for statistical analysis and call for methods that incorporate spatial dependence between sequences along the chromosome. For this purpose, we propose a novel method called CGHmix. It is based on a spatially structured mixture model with three states corresponding to genomic sequences that are either unmodified, deleted or amplified. Inference is performed in a Bayesian framework. From the output, posterior probabilities of belonging to each of the three states are estimated for each genomic sequence and used to classify them.


RESULTS
Using simulated data, CGHmix is validated and compared with both a conventional unstructured mixture model and with a recently proposed data mining method. We demonstrate the good performance of CGHmix for classifying copy number changes. In addition, the method provides a good estimate of the false discovery rate. We also present the analysis of a cancer related dataset.

c941489d0daf0ee6002f373bba5977e03056cf80,"20 Proteomics of human plasma in diastolic heart failure (DHF) using novel chemical affinity, mixed mode matrix (M3)","Background The understanding of diastolic heart failure (DHF) has developed in recent years, a condition that was often misdiagnosed for systolic heart failure (SHF). Although there are constant advances in diagnostic technologies, treatment and diagnosis for DHF still remain a challenge prompting a need for biomarker discovery within human plasma. Prospecting for new protein biomarkers can be hindered by the presence of high abundant proteins (HAPs), masking the appearance of potentially diagnostic low abundance proteins (LAPs) due to their dominance in the sample matrix. A novel method, termed Mixed Mode Matrix (M3), is described to reduce the complexity and improve the dynamic range of plasma proteomics to investigate biomarkers in DHF. A pilot study involving controls (n = 10) and disease (DHF n = 10, SHF n = 10) plasma was carried out. Method HAPs were depleted using MARS14 column, bound to M3, eluted into fractions using increasing concentrations of NaH 2 PO 4 and purified by solid-phase-extraction. A BCA protein assay was used to determine protein concentration prior to digestion. Peptides were separated using high-resolution liquid-chromatography (nano-UPLC) and high-definition-MSE analysis. Results A method for LAPs enrichment was developed. Over 300 LAPs were identified with 1% false discovery rate and contained at least 2 identified peptides. In depleting and enriching plasma with M3, we are able to expand the dynamic range of plasma thus enabling us to identify the LAPs. Conclusion M3 has the potential to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness of LAPs enrichment, leading to plasma protein biomarker identification for diagnosis and treatment of a multitude of disease states.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Richard J Mbasu"", ids = ""12202814""); list(name = ""Amirmansoor Hakimi"", ids = ""47434737""); list(name = ""Jatinderpal Kaur Sandhu"", ids = ""4221441""); list(name = ""Liam M Heaney"", ids = ""3301015""); list(name = ""Paulene A.

The CG or GG genotype of rs2301696 in TRPM5 was associated with decreased risk of childhood leukemia compared with the CC genotype (OR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.14-0.63, p(trend) = 0.002, min p = 0.004, FDR p = 0.17). Our findings suggest that genetic polymorphisms in immune response genes might play a role in childhood leukemia development with limited biologic evidence.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sohee Han"", ids = ""6801031""); list(name = ""Hong Hoe Koo"", ids = ""3862617""); list(name = ""Qing Lan"", ids = ""2359692""); list(name = ""Kyoung-Mu Lee"", ids = ""5389020""); list(name = ""Ae Kyung Park"", ids = ""4998003""); list(name = ""Sue Kyung Park"", ids = ""3395636""); list(name = ""Hyuna Sung"", ids = ""47022509""); list(name = ""Hyo Seop Ahn"", ids = ""4549380""); list(name = ""Hee Young Shin"", ids = ""2111603""); list(name = ""Hyoung Jin Kang"", ids = ""2990263""); list(name = ""Jong Jin Seo"", ids = ""40598728""); list(name = ""Yoon-Ok Ahn"", ids = ""89473385""); list(name = ""Ho Kim"", ids = ""37969695""); list(name = ""Nathaniel Rothman"", ids = ""144639248""); list(name = ""Daehee Kang"", ids = ""144385624"")",4b60afe24ac56301b302280b79e01d2253d470d3; d271749ce771e994b845701c6c3e3d293d254765; 32c96094094bee34dcce9c1c852d71c237e65848; e0af9feb70596514c3bd28f4516fb4708149143b; 47b34debf13d57f3d4e396271d5a47c8aa5ac078,,Human immunology,73 3,"

1a66bce710dc8dac5e41463b18fe8e2cad9b958b,Genetic variants in microRNA genes and targets associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors in the African-American population,"The purpose of this study is to identify microRNA (miRNA) related polymorphism, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in mature miRNA-encoding sequences or in miRNA-target sites, and their association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in African-American population. To achieve our objective, we examined 1900 African-Americans from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study using SNVs identified from whole-genome sequencing data. A total of 971 SNVs found in 726 different mature miRNA-encoding sequences and 16,057 SNVs found in the three prime untranslated region (3â€²UTR) of 3647 protein-coding genes were identified and interrogated their associations with 17 CVD risk factors. Using single-variant-based approach, we found 5 SNVs in miRNA-encoding sequences to be associated with serum Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or triglycerides, and 2 SNVs in miRNA-target sites to be associated with Lp(a) and HDL, all with false discovery rates of 5%. Using a gene-based approach, we identified 3 pairs of associations between gene NSD1 and platelet count, gene HSPA4L and cardiac troponin T, and gene AHSA2 and magnesium. We successfully validated the association between a variant specific to African-American population, NR_039880.1:n.18A>C, in mature hsa-miR-4727-5p encoding sequence and serum HDL level in an independent sample of 2135 African-Americans. Our study provided candidate miRNAs and their targets for further investigation of their potential contribution to ethnic disparities in CVD risk factors.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chang Li"", ids = ""114282486""); list(name = ""Megan L.

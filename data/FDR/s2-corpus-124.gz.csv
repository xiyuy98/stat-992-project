2065ea8e3be72b27e0467387b24e1f2b38422672,Military Personnel with Chronic Symptoms Following Blast Traumatic Brain Injury Have Differential Expression of Neuronal Recovery and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Genes,"OBJECTIVE
Approximately one-quarter of military personnel who deployed to combat stations sustained one or more blast-related, closed-head injuries. Blast injuries result from the detonation of an explosive device. The mechanisms associated with blast exposure that give rise to traumatic brain injury (TBI), and place military personnel at high risk for chronic symptoms of post-concussive disorder (PCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression are not elucidated.


METHODS
To investigate the mechanisms of persistent blast-related symptoms, we examined expression profiles of transcripts across the genome to determine the role of gene activity in chronic symptoms following blast-TBI. Active duty military personnel with (1) a medical record of a blast-TBI that occurred during deployment (nâ€‰=â€‰19) were compared to control participants without TBI (nâ€‰=â€‰17). Controls were matched to cases on demographic factors including age, gender, and race, and also in diagnoses of sleep disturbance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. Due to the high number of PCD symptoms in the TBI+ group, we did not match on this variable. Using expression profiles of transcripts in microarray platform in peripheral samples of whole blood, significantly differentially expressed gene lists were generated. Statistical threshold is based on criteria of 1.5 magnitude fold-change (up or down) and p-values with multiple test correction (false discovery rate <0.05).


RESULTS
There were 34 transcripts in 29 genes that were differentially regulated in blast-TBI participants compared to controls. Up-regulated genes included epithelial cell transforming sequence and zinc finger proteins, which are necessary for astrocyte differentiation following injury. Tensin-1, which has been implicated in neuronal recovery in pre-clinical TBI models, was down-regulated in blast-TBI participants. Protein ubiquitination genes, such as epidermal growth factor receptor, were also down-regulated and identified as the central regulators in the gene network determined by interaction pathway analysis.


CONCLUSION
In this study, we identified a gene-expression pathway of delayed neuronal recovery in military personnel a blast-TBI and chronic symptoms. Future work is needed to determine if therapeutic agents that regulate these pathways may provide novel treatments for chronic blast-TBI-related symptoms.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Morgan Heinzelmann"", ids = ""34677474""); list(name = ""Swarnalatha Y.

3e8baf01db7ee761439f8d4b8d0573d1f11fbdbd,Smaller $p$-values in genomics studies using distilled historical information,"Medical research institutions have generated massive amounts of biological data by genetically profiling hundreds of cancer cell lines. In parallel, academic biology labs have conducted genetic screens on small numbers of cancer cell lines under custom experimental conditions. In order to share information between these two approaches to scientific discovery, this article proposes a â€œfrequentist assisted by Bayesâ€ (FAB) procedure for hypothesis testing that allows historical information from massive genomics datasets to increase the power of hypothesis tests in specialized studies. The exchange of information takes place through a novel probability model for multimodal genomics data, which distills historical information pertaining to cancer cell lines and genes across a wide variety of experimental contexts. If the relevance of the historical information for a given study is high, then the resulting FAB tests can be more powerful than the corresponding classical tests. If the relevance is low, then the FAB tests yield as many discoveries as the classical tests. Simulations and practical investigations demonstrate that the FAB testing procedure can increase the number of effects discovered in genomics studies while still maintaining strict control of type I error and false discovery rates.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jordan Bryan"", ids = ""49579004""); list(name = ""Peter L De Hoff"", ids = ""145519771"")",,13f1ddad7fec4c92bef521096f2128f1dd573c1d; 48a6cafd4970f2fd30c0fbb0d757098b58af3e8d; e888925fd0ebc27f6a4b0dbb84545fe9c842abef; 3e4f0dd083653b7861ecf5f306d4fb87232ad636; 53e0a33ce026f261a995f605dd5580953331f62c; cec027085080785d26eec58549743cf08c6135f7; 1bb12475e6af0b9d927f474ece7af86eac7d511c; 81bbe42e3ec09c28b8864956148e58f4cb5aa860; 00f18105404eb37e5830131769371ba0e1aa8cf8; 0860d7d98cf9fd2e812ddd019fc15ce866927c33; 03ab4d9d8fd2794b6f1d6cc467d4f597187595a5; c5f1b6668a518a9b1e7e73d66820768018c21234; 9cd8ce0550c98829138f3b2cd171c7a27848cb12; babf4620f2461f6c6fdfba30096cf7b2bd1d3e89; 5c0394a8130f4d686b4a578e5fcd895fabde498a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 0bdc9b5408168b8b1fa5931ed4080ca80b6c04c4; b3631d8d2656c0c72ad92f3b0a77af2afde649a5; eb3b1b6daf488650cec3d6a6c42faf3d07d1f89d; bb9568ef814557ee321b76ace75fd4225f62e398; 930281f635c92fe3dee041b3e1315e606c76850e; fe6959b61656e79e9f4613279053dd18c73fbc29; e1741c93ebb6bdd39e44f6e35d38f652cfd58a37; 2913fe39492f177f1a571c79b13abca92a25388f; 0b0bd913a4315701638587db7d786dfca063416b; 14ead31c6091beed71880ab1da2dd52876a5dd71; 51ca75c7a850ef68fd26028941545e279aa2973a; 47a0bc0ca7029e356059ad60a7b1df1e687f74eb; 4406347fcdbb3df791b7e5df74a22fcabcd26a5b; a10d1783a1e8dc8746728e7a29ead80e783849fb; 571f6ed9a6bb8473ab4193b25c59e065163728e6; 950026704da4dafc87198803cd82636d0b05a83b,,,

Methods Fifty-four episodic migraine, 56 chronic migraine patients and 50 controls underwent T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging acquisitions. Number of streamlines (trajectories of estimated fiber-tracts), mean fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity were the connectome measures. Correlation analysis between connectome measures and duration and frequency of migraine was performed. Results Higher and lower number of streamlines were found in connections involving regions like the superior frontal gyrus when comparing episodic and chronic migraineurs with controls (pâ€‰<â€‰.05 false discovery rate). Between the left caudal anterior cingulate and right superior frontal gyri, more streamlines were found in chronic compared to episodic migraine. Higher and lower fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were found between migraine groups and controls in connections involving regions like the hippocampus. Lower radial diffusivity and axial diffusivity were found in chronic compared to episodic migraine in connections involving regions like the putamen. In chronic migraine, duration of migraine was positively correlated with fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity.

We assessed the ability of dynamic contrast enhanced T1 MRI (DCE-MRI) perfusion to identify pseudoprogression in melanoma brain metastases. Patients with melanoma brain metastases who underwent immunotherapy and DCE-MRI were identified. Enhancing lesionsâ€‰â‰¥â€‰ 5mm in diameter on DCE-MRI and that were new or increased in size between a week from beginning the treatment, and a month after completing the treatment were included in the analysis. The 90th percentiles of rVp and rKtrans and the presence or absence of hemorrhage were recorded. Histopathology served as the reference standard for pseudoprogression. If not available, pseudoprogression was defined as neurological and radiographic stability or improvement without any new treatment forâ€‰â‰¥â€‰2 months. Forty-four patients were identified; 64% received ipilimumab monotherapy for a median duration of 9 weeks (range, 1â€“138). Sixty-four lesions in 44 patients were included in the study. Of these, nine lesions in eight patients were determined to be pseudoprogression and seven lesions were previously irradiated. Forty-four progression lesions and eight pseudoprogression lesions were hemorrhagic. Median lesion volume for pseudoprogression and progression were not significantly different, at 2.3 cm3 and 3.2 cm3, respectively (pâ€‰=â€‰0.82). The rVp90 was smaller in pseudoprogression versus progression, at 2.2 and 5.3, respectively (pâ€‰=â€‰0.02), and remained significant after false discovery rate adjustment (pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). Pseudoprogression exhibited significantly lower rVp90 on DCE-MRI compared with progression.

Previous epidemiological studies have mainly focused on phthalate metabolites and bisphenol A. Our study aimed to assess associations between in-utero exposure to the afore mentioned compounds and other ubiquitous phenolic compounds and the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of boys at 5â€“6 years. Methods In 452 mother-son dyads from the French EDEN cohort, we measured 11 phthalate metabolites and 9 phenolic compounds (4 parabens, benzophenone-3, bisphenol A, 2 dichlorophenols and triclosan) in spot urine samples collected between 22 and 29 gestational weeks. Verbal and performance IQ of children was assessed at 5â€“6 years by a psychologist using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI). We used adjusted Structural Equation Models (SEM) and the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction to assess the associations between maternal urine phenol and phthalate metabolite concentrations considered simultaneously and the boysâ€™ IQ. Results No phenol or phthalate metabolite concentration was negatively associated with child verbal or performance IQ (p-valuesâ‰¥0.09). Mono (3-carboxypropyl) phthalate tended to be associated with increased verbal IQ (Î²=0.136, 95% confidence interval, 0.01; 0.27) but this association disappeared after correction for multiple comparison (corrected p- 64 value, 0.71). Conclusion To our knowledge, our study is the first to consider developmental exposure to parabens, dichlorophenols, triclosan and benzophenone-3 in relation to child cognitive development. Our findings did not suggest an inverse association between in-utero phenols and phthalates exposure and child verbal and performance IQ.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dorothy Nakiwala"", ids = ""12992994""); list(name = ""Hugo Peyre"", ids = ""2889617""); list(name = ""Barbara Heude"", ids = ""4365405""); list(name = ""Jonathan Y Bernard"", ids = ""31708539""); list(name = ""RÃ©mi BÃ©ranger"", ids = ""4487386""); list(name = ""RÃ©my Slama"", ids = ""34893849""); list(name = ""Claire Philippat"", ids = ""5422476"")",,,Occupational and Environmental Medicine,75,
53a119658ac0093a7ae5a04948b764550cd86b73,Intensive cardiovascular risk reduction induces sustainable changes in expression of genes and pathways important to vascular function.,"BACKGROUND
Healthy lifestyle changes are thought to mediate cardiovascular disease risk through pathways affecting endothelial function and progression of atherosclerosis; however, the extent, persistence, and clinical significance of molecular change during lifestyle modification are not well known. We examined the effect of a rigorous cardiovascular disease risk reduction program on peripheral blood gene expression profiles in 63 participants and 63 matched controls to characterize molecular responses and identify regulatory pathways important to cardiovascular health.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Dramatic changes in dietary fat intake (-61%; P<0.001 versus controls) and physical fitness (+34%; P<0.001) led to significant improvements in cardiovascular disease risk factors. Analysis of variance with false discovery rate correction for multiple testing (P<0.05) identified 26 genes after 12 weeks and 143 genes after 52 weeks that were differentially expressed from baseline in participants. Controls showed little change in cardiovascular disease risk factors or gene expression. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction validated differential expression for selected transcripts. Lifestyle modification effectively reduced expression of proinflammatory genes associated with neutrophil activation and molecular pathways important to vascular function, including cytokine production, carbohydrate metabolism, and steroid hormones. Prescription medications did not significantly affect changes in gene expression.


CONCLUSIONS
Successful and sustained modulation of gene expression through lifestyle changes may have beneficial effects on the vascular system not apparent from traditional risk factors. Healthy lifestyles may restore homeostasis to the leukocyte transcriptome by downregulating lactoferrin and other genes important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

Information about NSW and other covariates was collected using a structured questionnaire and twenty-two polymorphisms in 11 genes were analyzed in a hospital-based case-control study with 941 cases of breast cancer and 959 controls. In analysis of the main effects of each single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs), variants in CLOCK rs11133373 was associated with breast cancer risk even after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (Odd Ratios (OR)â€‰=â€‰1.38 (95% Confident Interval (CI) 1.14â€“1.69) in CG and CC compared to GG genotype. Analysis of MTNR1A rs2119882 demonstrated a decreased risk of breast cancer in CC compared to TT (p-FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.043). A correlation between NSW and breast cancer interaction was found in two loci. NSW increased risk of breast cancer in women who carried the heterozygote genotype of CRY2 rs2292912 (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.98, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.14â€“3.44) or carried at least one minor allele of RORA rs1482057 (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.20, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.10â€“4.37).

90e3a92c3631624b6acbfbb44f59193297f94922,Peripheral blood RNA gene expression profiling in patients with bacterial meningitis,"OBJECTIVES
The aim of present study was to find genetic pathways activated during infection with bacterial meningitis (BM) and potentially influencing the course of the infection using genome-wide RNA expression profiling combined with pathway analysis and functional annotation of the differential transcription.


METHODS
We analyzed 21 patients with BM hospitalized in 2008. The control group consisted of 18 healthy subjects. The RNA was extracted from whole blood, globin mRNA was depleted and gene expression profiling was performed using GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays which can assess the transcription of 28,869 genes. Gene expression profile data were analyzed using Bioconductor packages and Bayesian modeling. Functional annotation of the enriched gene sets was used to define the altered genetic networks. We also analyzed whether gene expression profiles depend on the clinical course and outcome. In order to verify the microarray results, the expression levels of ten functionally relevant genes with high statistical significance (CD177, IL1R2, IL18R1, IL18RAP, OLFM4, TLR5, CPA3, FCER1A, IL5RA, and IL7R) were confirmed by quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR.


RESULTS
There were 8569 genes displaying differential expression at a significance level of p < 0.05. Following False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction, a total of 5500 genes remained significant at a p-value of < 0.01. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the differential expression in 10 selected genes. Functional annotation and network analysis indicated that most of the genes were related to activation of humoral and cellular immune responses (enrichment score 43). Those changes were found in both adults and in children with BM compared to the healthy controls. The gene expression profiles did not significantly depend on the clinical outcome, but there was a strong influence of the specific type of pathogen underlying BM.

927aca4b282884289742de618df59e0cb7475958,Increased expression of neutrophil-related genes in patients with early sepsis-induced ARDS.,"The early sequence of events leading to the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with sepsis remains inadequately understood. The purpose of this study was to identify changes in gene expression early in the course of illness, when mechanisms of injury may provide the most relevant treatment and prognostic targets. We collected whole blood RNA in critically ill patients admitted from the Emergency Department to the intensive care unit within 24 h of admission at a tertiary care center. Whole genome expression was compared in patients with sepsis and ARDS to patients with sepsis alone. We selected genes with >1 log2 fold change and false discovery rate <0.25, determined their significance in the literature, and performed pathway analysis. Several genes were upregulated in 29 patients with sepsis with ARDS compared with 28 patients with sepsis alone. The most differentially expressed genes included key mediators of the initial neutrophil response to infection: olfactomedin 4, lipocalin 2, CD24, and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein. These gene expression differences withstood adjustment for age, sex, study batch, white blood cell count, and presence of pneumonia or aspiration. Pathway analysis demonstrated overrepresentation of genes involved in known respiratory and infection pathways. These data indicate that several neutrophil-related pathways may be involved in the early pathogenesis of sepsis-related ARDS. In addition, identifiable gene expression differences occurring early in the course of sepsis-related ARDS may further elucidate understanding of the neutrophil-related mechanisms in progression to ARDS.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kirsten Neudoerffer Kangelaris"", ids = ""6373490""); list(name = ""Arun C Prakash"", ids = ""46406305""); list(name = ""Kathleen D.

c3244de2cdc1596d3d7b2f7b036beb4e4ab93b7b,The role of read depth in the design and analysis of sequencing experiments,"The development of quantitative sequencing technologies, such as RNA-Seq, BarSeq, ChIP-Seq, and metagenomics, has offered great insight into molecular biology. Proper design and analysis of these experiments require statistical models and techniques that consider the specific nature of sequencing data, which typically consists of a matrix of read counts per feature. An issue of particular importance to the development of these methods is the role of read depth in statistical accuracy and power. The depth of an experiment affects the power to make biological conclusions, meaning an experiment design must consider the tradeoff between cost, power, and the number of samples that are examined. Similarly, per-gene read depth affects each geneâ€™s power and accuracy, and must be taken into account in any downstream analysis. Here I explore many facets of the role of read depth in the design and analysis of sequencing experiments, and offer computational and statistical methods for addressing them. To assist in the design of sequencing experiments, I present subSeq, which examines the effect of depth in an experiment by subsampling reads to simulate lower depths. I use this method to examine the extent of read saturation across a variety of RNA-Seq experiments, and demonstrate a statistical model for predicting the effect of increasing depth in any experiment. I consider intensity-dependence in a technology comparison between microarrays and RNA-Seq, and show that the variance added by RNA-Seq depends more on depth than the variance in microarray depends on fluorescence intensity. I demonstrate that Bar-Seq data shares these depth-dependent properties with RNA-Seq and can be analyzed by the same tools, iii and further provide suggestions on the appropriate depth for Bar-Seq experiments. Finally, I show that per-gene read depth can be taken into account in multiple hypothesis testing to improve power, and introduce the method of functional false discovery rate (fFDR) control.",2015,Computer Science,"list(name = ""David G.

617361bae4d8eb3546b432da9c2409de591c6c75,Machine learning Classification of Dyslexic Children based on EEG Local Network Features,"Machine learning can be used to find meaningful patterns characterizing individual differences. Deploying a machine learning classifier fed by local features derived from graph analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) data, we aimed at designing a neurobiologically-based classifier to differentiate two groups of children, one group with and the other group without dyslexia, in a robust way. We used EEG resting-state data of 29 dyslexics and 15 typical readers in grade 3, and calculated weighted connectivity matrices for multiple frequency bands using the phase lag index (PLI). From the connectivity matrices, we derived weighted connectivity graphs. A number of local network measures were computed from those graphs, and 37 False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrected features were selected as input to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a common K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. Cross validation was employed to assess the machine-learning performance and random shuffling to assure the performance appropriateness of the classifier and avoid features overfitting. The best performance was for the SVM using a polynomial kernel. Children were classified with 95% accuracy based on local network features from different frequency bands. The automatic classification techniques applied to EEG graph measures showed to be both robust and reliable in distinguishing between typical and dyslexic readers.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Zahra Rezvani"", ids = ""94703677""); list(name = ""M.

379e10bacce9b3e2458367698f54031c61bafd48,CT texture analysis: a potential tool for predicting the Fuhrman grade of clear-cell renal carcinoma,"BackgroundThe purpose of this study was to analyze the image heterogeneity of clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma (ccRCC) by computer tomography texture analysis and to provide new objective quantitative imaging parameters for the pre-operative prediction of Fuhrman-grade ccRCC.MethodsA retrospective analysis of 131 cases of ccRCCs was performed by manually depicting tumor areas. Then, histogram-based texture parameters were calculated. The texture-feature values between Fuhrman low- (Grade I-II) and high-grade (Grade III-IV) ccRCCs were compared by two independent sample t-tests (False Discovery Rate correction), and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to evaluate the efficacy of using texture features to predict Fuhrman high- and low-grade ccRCCs.ResultsThere were no statistical differences for any texture parameters without filtering (pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). There was a statistically significant difference between the entropy (fine) of the corticomedullary phase and the entropy (fine and coarse) of the nephrographic phase after Laplace of Gaussian filtering. The area under the ROC of the entropy was between 0.74 and 0.83.ConclusionsComputer tomography texture features can predict the Fuhrman grading of ccRCC pre-operatively, with entropy being the most important imaging marker for clinical application.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhan Feng"", ids = ""47536644""); list(name = ""Qijun Shen"", ids = ""2715354""); list(name = ""Ying Li"", ids = ""144587057""); list(name = ""Zhengyu Hu"", ids = ""11918750"")",64dbbeb4ed20b8f6312a38fd7af3c39ee697f5f2; 9f6bdf5bb8f9c406e7ef2f19e002514f306a3c4a; d123189baa2204faf21ca620d2a79224337c5482; 1b17a4ed3b33181298eb8917c598c880b3f847cc; 5f4f608575f9a58d8d48da6f2fb27b29d9e4213c,e9a2e55ea5cdab657d7b69ebee568ce6e30d4584; 0862b38447037d12850555df23991b0296809fca; 12b3f61a4fbea2b3e2d4f40ec3a7441a9c8d4d8c; 3052ed5765e93fefb8b1ab2ca36504a868f49f14; a8c7ed854bfd808ab36e0d1ca007638dde2afd80; 316ad31910c3a78919d697e52965132bc4f6f1b6; f05652856bc63dec266d06c727b1d574be0f3385; 95413cf4a8935273fa0443ef586e4820602da76f; 1cfd59936ceb22701ace41b91fbb73db811efe3f; a4ad66f3046d34f63c0a9ea20dcaef633036ea14; 6bfb3d11bedfcbbbcc433ec4be0e8a1ba83376b3; 0b39bd76272ccca493eeaff165fb42f173dc38b9; 67adb109e8c9d181e6a6475c28aa6703bc8f58ba; 97e8c0aaaf2866336e842900c41858db074aa17c; 95254131438b11c66c6fe386960f25abfc511efc; eefb9d9e0f275138cb52452fb6713ccd4a90caab; 459656237da934b28c61f3e164dbf696aa5a41b2; f1ddbee2e6d041a5e2ca0b617699ef543a587a77; 91766084dcbd1e0520e66c963a692e6f11d8bed1; 6a0ea15e65c4f1fe6b6f084b2c613933a4ecb7e2; 9bee6e5f6368f168e4bff0a562d7146657a4c421; 191d0ea8f632ea1fe7464b315b478f197291d64f; 41fc209957b5ea4933251380bfb79b7578f75740; b404b3534219f7226ae99029aa99b0c2a0b2d2f6; ee908e15877c021c3fdcbf17acca1e8d83c70569; 6f0b20545da7231f59e9a19f8cee3b6eb2aa71d7; a148831d1162c427dd9f35bdf8a525458f4e54f7; cd82b85a71695d38899f0b6e25e87de8e3ea2120; aed58b7c7a47c2274f229ec20649ca3a3a9280f4; aa254030d9fa3a78631a92560dc48942c764b3bc; 5ebd7c4709bce0dd93ea1a3635bc2fcb49536fa0,Cancer Imaging,19,

Circulating proteins may illuminate EOC etiology and have the potential to serve as biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis. We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study with circulating protein levels as exposures and susceptibility to EOC and its histological subtypes as outcomes. We used previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) robustly associated with plasma levels of 1,478 proteins as genetic instruments and corresponding summary genetic association statistics for these instruments derived from 22,406 EOC cases and 40,941 controls. Among proteins that had only a single QTL variant available as a genetic instrument, we identified 12 proteins whose circulating levels were associated with overall EOC risk at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of Citation Format: Daniel P.

4090f1cb0efdd9f5e89d5ba18e67b80978802fb4,Power of a genome scan to detect and locate quantitative trait loci in cattle using dense single nucleotide polymorphisms.,"There is increasing use of dense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for whole-genome association studies (WGAS) in livestock to map and identify quantitative trait loci (QTL). These studies rely on linkage disequilibrium (LD) to detect an association between SNP genotypes and phenotypes. The power and precision of these WGAS are unknown, and will depend on the extent of LD in the experimental population. One complication for WGAS in livestock populations is that they typically consist of many paternal half-sib families, and in some cases full-sib families; unless this subtle population stratification is accounted for, many spurious associations may be reported. Our aim was to investigate the power, precision and false discovery rates of WGAS for QTL discovery, with a commercial SNP array, given existing patterns of LD in cattle. We also tested the efficiency of selective genotyping animals. A total of 365 cattle were genotyped for 9232 SNPs. We simulated a QTL effect as well as polygenic and environmental effects for all animals. One QTL was simulated on a randomly chosen SNP and accounted for 5%, 10% or 18% of the total variance. The power to detect a moderate-sized additive QTL (5% of the phenotypic variance) with 365 animals genotyped was 37% (p < 0.001). Most importantly, if pedigree structure was not accounted for, the number of false positives significantly increased above those expected by chance alone. Selective genotyping also resulted in a significant increase in false positives, even when pedigree structure was accounted for.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Iona M Macleod"", ids = ""1850096""); list(name = ""Ben J.

73bd890b9e08e845dd179eaacbfda6f2f06c5467,Performance Analysis of GMM Classifier for Classification of Normal and Abnormal Segments in PPG Signals,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used to estimate the blood flow of skin by utilizing the infrared technique. Parameters such as blood pressure, oxygen saturation levels, blood saturation levels and cardiac output levels can be measured easily. As PPG is non-invasive in nature and it has a low production and maintenance cost, it is widely used in clinical practices. The performance analysis of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as a post classifier is utilized in this paper for the classification of normal and abnormal segments in PPG Signals. The main objective of the paper is to identify normal and abnormal PPG Segments of the PPG waveform observed in the long time monitoring of the Physionet Data Base available online for a particular patient. The PPG Signals are sampled at 100 Hz. The PPG data sample length obtained is 1, 44, 000 and it is segmented into equal intervals comprising of 200 samples totally. Therefore the entire data consists of 720 segments. Totally ten different features such as mean, variance, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, energy, approximate entropy, peak maximum, maximum slope, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are extracted and normalized. Based on the SVD values, each segment is labeled as normal or abnormal segment. The normalized features are given as inputs to the GMM classifier to classify the normal and abnormal segments in the PPG Signals. The performance metrics analyzed in this work are specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision and False Discovery Rate (FDR). Results show that an accuracy of 98.97% is obtained, precision of 100%, nil FDR, specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 97.95% is obtained.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sunil Kumar Prabhakar"", ids = ""47393850""); list(name = ""Harikumar Rajaguru"", ids = ""1850290"")",,,,,73-79

To determine whether markers that we have recently shown to associate with Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in Europeans also associate with BMD in East-Asians we analysed 50 markers from 23 genomic loci in samples from Korea (n = 1,397) and two Chinese Hong Kong sample sets (n = 3,869 and n = 785). Through this effort we identified fourteen loci that associated with BMD in East-Asian samples using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05; 1p36 (ZBTB40, P = 4.3610), 1p31 (GPR177, P = 0.00012), 3p22 (CTNNB1, P = 0.00013), 4q22 (MEPE, P = 0.0026), 5q14 (MEF2C, P = 1.3610), 6q25 (ESR1, P = 0.0011), 7p14 (STARD3NL, P = 0.00025), 7q21 (FLJ42280, P = 0.00017), 8q24 (TNFRSF11B, P = 3.4610), 11p15 (SOX6, P = 0.00033), 11q13 (LRP5, P = 0.0033), 13q14 (TNFSF11, P = 7.5610), 16q24 (FOXL1, P = 0.0010) and 17q21 (SOST, P = 0.015). Our study marks an early effort towards the challenge of cataloguing bone density variants shared by many ethnicities by testing BMD variants that have been established in Europeans, in East-Asians.

fed75b8fef9c7fa9ee62e2c9ab0da3a0f5c40349,Relative Abundance of Transcripts ( RATs): Identifying differential isoform abundance from RNA-seq,"The biological importance of changes in RNA expression is reflected by the wide variety of tools available to characterise these changes from RNA-seq data. Several tools exist for detecting differential transcript isoform usage (DTU) from aligned or assembled RNA-seq data, but few exist for DTU detection from alignment-free RNA-seq quantifications. We present the RATs, an R package that identifies DTU transcriptome-wide directly from transcript abundance estimates. RATs is unique in applying bootstrapping to estimate the reliability of detected DTU events and shows good performance at all replication levels (median false positive fraction < 0.05). We compare RATs to two existing DTU tools, DRIM-Seq & SUPPA2, using two publicly available simulated RNA-seq datasets and a published human RNA-seq dataset, in which 248 genes have been previously identified as displaying significant DTU. RATs with default threshold values on the simulated Human data has a sensitivity of 0.55, a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.71 and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.04, outperforming both other tools. Applying the same thresholds for SUPPA2 results in a higher sensitivity (0.61) but poorer FDR performance (0.33). RATs and DRIM-seq use different methods for measuring DTU effect-sizes complicating the comparison of results between these tools, however, for a likelihood-ratio threshold of 30, DRIM-Seq has similar FDR performance to RATs (0.06), but worse sensitivity (0.47). These differences persist for the simulated drosophila dataset. On the published human RNA-seq dataset the greatest agreement between the tools tested is 53%, observed between RATs and SUPPA2. The bootstrapping quality filter in RATs is responsible for removing the majority of DTU events called by SUPPA2 that are not reported by RATs. All methods, including the previously published qRT-PCR of three of the 248 detected DTU events, were found to be sensitive to annotation differences between Ensembl v60 and v87.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kimon Froussios"", ids = ""77948046""); list(name = ""Kira MourÃ£o"", ids = ""2798240""); list(name = ""Gordon Simpson"", ids = ""26098530""); list(name = ""Geoffrey J.

7f8bf8df04c9709163ed66e3a84638902fa133ec,Multiple testing with persistent homology,"Multiple hypothesis testing requires a control procedure. Simply increasing simulations or permutations to meet a Bonferroni-style threshold is prohibitively expensive. In this paper we propose a null model based approach to testing for acyclicity, coupled with a Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) control method that does not suffer from these computational costs. We adapt an False Discovery Rate (FDR) control approach to the topological setting, and show it to be compatible both with our null model approach and with previous approaches to hypothesis testing in persistent homology. By extending a limit theorem for persistent homology on samples from point processes, we provide theoretical validation for our FWER and FDR control methods.",2018,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson"", ids = ""1388373530""); list(name = ""Sayan Mukherjee"", ids = ""48069573"")",,a6033a9a7df0a3e6e27c872b2e591310319bb36f; 561b44b1a9cd6fd13e700a5e3caaa5de75b33526; ddbd1366835b63d8c6ba0c5f3adc6b016976c9b9; f0e90f624073433f04fa1749ebc42c19c38109ab; ea6cf08e4d99665311266dee4948952ce2628098; 98fdb4608f698dcb974af01790e3d6038fb25ef1; 0f8c1840895ad2fae24bdefd00daf65ebbe14178; d90c1f2412fd09dde46cd05394e01a75c532b329; c9c8cabbb15c7341324c010fe205c8c676fbb375; 69fdee78958fa92d592484af582c642c51fa0274; 811b6522e78bcde3884b0c12aa90de3bee41cb28; 93b68a6b7ec11575ef099821b7058a59a714c777; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; 14d0faa1e9e3e33c400176a33c657992ab332a88; 3e7b615fb9f4186189e1a414c130917117cd5db5; 29215cde9c1645f1823d50cc6314bf3c2a1c37f9; b3df77856bdf2f23e4be0eb693227aed8dccee1d; 2fa0a49e60c809ec5178a00a4eadc41b9169ad97; 3752b27e2dcdc34c362918dddf43ae0f0f82579a; 6d2362a45066ebf2fcbe1a225360c0264eab1ebe; 455b8ba72a8a66086e5bd4b71db84ae41fa77dd8; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 8ac65a273e0ce855581742edfd44b8880fb1ae37; 204256bddea57fed650506f319692b57ced8f555,ArXiv,abs/1812.06491,
b678689d6d97787d0b843175c8dba0d86241d498,Profiling of the Kidney Glomerulus,"The kidney glomerulus plays a crucial role in ultrafiltration of the blood through the glomerular capillary wall. Glomerulus injury may occur in many systemic and primary kidney diseases or as secondary effects to drugs and infections. It has been shown that many known glomerular specific/enriched genes play crucial roles in the maintenance of glomerular filtration function and in the pathogenesis of the known glomerular diseases of known etiology. With functional genomics and bioinformatics approaches, the identification of additional glomerular specific/enriched gene transcripts will provide a better understanding of the glomerular physiology and function, as well as the mechanisms of glomerular diseases where causes and pathogenic processes are still poorly understood. To achieve the goal of identifying glomerular genes, we, firstly, performed comparative analysis of mouse glomerular EST libraries and whole kidney EST libraries. In this study, we found 497 glomerular enriched genes. These glomerular enriched genes were validated by different approaches. In situ hybridization confirmed the cellular location of six new glomerular markers. Apart from the mouse kidney EST library comparisons, we integrated the results of glomerular enriched genes from four additional expression-profiling platforms, and made a comprehensive catalogue of glomerular genes. Based on this, a protein-protein interaction network in glomerulus (GlomNet) was constructed. To further understanding the gene expression profile of human glomerulus, we performed transcriptional profiling of human kidney glomeruli which were obtained from renal needle biopsies taken from live renal transplant donors. By comparison with our mouse transcriptional profiling data, we observed a surprisingly large difference between the most glomerulus-specfic genes in humans and mice, respectively. Furthermore, the common glomerular enriched genes between human and mouse were classified into six different clusters according to their expression specificity in human and mouse glomeruli. To gain insight into glomerular transcriptional changes that accompany pathological processes leading to proteinuria, we analyzed gene expression profiles following glomerular injury in the mouse lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proteinuria model. LPS triggered the specific gene expression pattern changes in the glomerulus and regulated several different pathways. We observed that podocyte number decreased significantly in the model. Moreover, the genes encoded collagen Î±1, Î±2 and laminin Î²2 chains which are expressed in the embryonic kidney glomerulus increased their expression in LPS-treated mice, suggesting remodeling of the glomerular basement membrane, caused by activation or dedifferentiation of glomerular cells. In summary, the new glomerular gene transcripts identified in this thesis provide the foundation for targeted analysis of individual genes and pathways, and the GlomNet provides a preliminary systematic view of the relationships and interactions between different components in the glomerulus. The methodology of human glomerular transcription profiling can be applied for the identification of diagnostic and prognostic markers for renal diseases. The transcriptional profile changes accompanying LPS-induced proteinuria may provide clues about mechanisms involved in proteinuria. The information from this study contributes new insights for the glomerular function, physiology and the disease mechanisms. LIST OF PUBLICATIONS I.

05406c0ef564cd5cdcc0e82df8270cf3d0028083,Determination of the effect of Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Breit. on nervous system development by proteomics.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE
Banxia (BX) is the dried tuber of Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Breit., a commonly prescribed Chinese medicinal herb for the treatment of cough, phlegm, and vomiting in pregnant women. However, raw BX has been demonstrated to exert toxic effects on reproduction and the precise and comprehensive mechanisms remain elusive.


AIM OF THE STUDY
We applied an iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, iTRAQ)-based proteomic method to explore the mechanisms of raw BX-induced fetal toxicity in mice.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The mice were separated into two groups, control mice and BX-treated mice. From gestation days 6-8, the control group was treated with normal saline and the BX group was exposed to BX suspension (2.275g/kg/day). Gastrulae were obtained and analyzed using the quantitative proteomic approach of iTRAQ coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A multi-omics data analysis tool, OmicsBean (http://www.omicsbean.cn), was employed to conduct bioinformatic analysis of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting methods were applied to detect the protein expression levels and validate the quality of the proteomics.


RESULTS
A total of 1245 proteins were identified with < 1% false discovery rate (FDR) and 583 protein abundance changes were confidently assessed. Moreover, 153 proteins identified in BX-treated samples showed significant differences in abundance. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the functions of 37 DAPs were predominantly related to nervous system development. The expression levels of the selected proteins for quantification by qRT-PCR or western blotting were consistent with the results in iTRAQ-labeled proteomics data.


CONCLUSION
The results suggested that oral administration of BX in mice may cause fetal abnormality of the nervous system. The findings may be helpful to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of BX-induced embryotoxicity.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jianya Xu"", ids = ""91083908""); list(name = ""Chen Dai"", ids = ""144959296""); list(name = ""Jinjun Shan"", ids = ""144939415""); list(name = ""Tong.

To gain insight into the molecular changes associated with the increased excitability of the amygdala, we used a newly developed cDNA array system comprising mouse KIAA cDNA clones to identify novel genes differentially expressed in the amygdala of fyn(-/-) and fyn(+/-) mice following administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Laser capture microdissection in combination with PCR-based cDNA amplification allowed us to analyze gene expression in each amygdalar subdivision. The statistical significance of the differential expressions was tested by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) by the false discovery rate controlling approach. Among the 805 mKIAA cDNA clones tested, only the expression level of mKIAA1577 (Zinc finger SWIM domain containing protein 6; gene name, Zswim6) showed statistically significant change in regard to the genotype and amygdalar subdivision. Namely, only the lowered expression of mKIAA1577 in the central nucleus of fyn(-/-) mice 1 h after NMDA administration (2.1-fold lower relative to fyn(+/-) mice) was statistically significant. In situ hybridization analysis confirmed the downregulation of the mRNA in the central nucleus of the fyn(-/-) mice 1 h after NMDA administration (3.2-fold lower relative to fyn(+/-) mice). The NMDA-induced change in gene expression was partially blocked by the NMDA antagonist D-AP-5. These results suggest that Fyn deficiency was responsible for the NMDA-induced downregulation of a specific gene in the amygdalar central nucleus.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nobuyuki Kai"", ids = ""35538742""); list(name = ""Katsuro Iwase"", ids = ""8418860""); list(name = ""Kazuhide Imai"", ids = ""11158620""); list(name = ""Eiko Nakahira"", ids = ""4543205""); list(name = ""Shigeki Yuasa"", ids = ""34984734"")",619cd7e130ee9b893969142c2500d7992270f6a8; c29dd8edbaa5f6f31157c1d5f3d75f27d8b96fb6; 36ff8ffee2313947316ef8dd6073d8dffedaa93e; 34489ebb97dc78b37ea02f3de38ae17003a48146; 94489658e0e76729fa1ae46589a3e393327f2723,,Brain Research,1073â€“1074,60-70
3b0a0a630a4157a72531547e2b3048642d106a1f,How to smooth diffusion tensor images in a voxel based analysis ?,"Introduction: Many DTI studies are starting to use voxel based analysis (VBA) to evaluate differences in the diffusion properties between healthy diseased subjects. Despite the intuitively appealing approach of analyzing diffusion measures at each voxel, VBA results should be interpreted cautiously, since they depend on the applied parameter settings. Since, for example, in the VBA literature of DTI data sets, a large range of isotropic smoothing kernel widths from 0 mm to as much as 16 mm is used, the VBA results are less standardized than they promised to be, especially since Jones et al. demonstrated that the VBA results depend on the applied smoothing kernel width (1-3). Smoothing is performed in a VBA setting to increase the sensitivity of the pathology detection, following the matched filter theorem, and to mitigate the effect of coregistration errors. In this context, a smoothing kernel width that corresponds to the expected size and shape of the pathology should be applied. In this work, simulated DTI data sets with a predefined pathology are used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the VBA pathology detection comparing isotropic and anisotropic smoothing kernels with different full width at half maximum (FWHM). Methods: Simulated DTI data sets are constructed with a specific pathology as defined by a predefined location, extent, and level of tissue degradation. The method can be summarized as follows: (a) 40 DTI data sets are acquired on a 1.5T scanner (2x2x2mm). (b) All 40 DTI data sets are transformed to the Montreal MNI space with an affine transformation based on the FA maps (c) A population specific atlas is constructed from these images in MNI space (4). (d) The resulting atlas is regarded as the fundamental image and is copied 40 times. (e) In half of these atlases, the diffusion properties are altered to introduce a pathology in a predefined number of voxels: i.e., the transverse diffusivity is increased by six different corresponding with an FA decrease of 7%, 10%, 13%, 16%, 19%, and 22%. (f) Inter-subject variability of the diffusion properties is introduced in all atlas images, i.e. in the 20 original atlases and in the 20 atlases with a pathology. (g) Finally, a realistic amount of Rician noise is added to the data sets. The FA maps of these data sets are subsequently smoothed before a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test is performed in each voxel. In this work, the false discovery rate method of Benjamini and Hochberg was used to correct the p-values for multiple comparisons. A false discovery rate bound of p=0.05 was thereby applied. To evaluate the effect of the isotropic smoothing kernel size on the sensitivity and the specificity of the VBA analysis, the data sets are smoothed with smoothing kernels of different FWHM: 3 mm, 6 mm, 9 mm, and 12 mm. An edge and corner preserving filter for magnitude MR data was constructed using an anisotropic Gaussian smoothing kernel shaped by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a local gradient tensor and applied to the FA maps (5). Analogously as in the isotropic smoothing approach, the effect of the smoothing kernel width on the VBA results is evaluated by smoothing the data sets with a similar range of FWHMs: 3 mm, 6 mm, 9 mm, and 12 mm. Results: The effect of isotropic and anisotropic smoothing on an FA image is visualized for a random axial slice in Fig. 1 for different isotropic and anisotropic smoothing kernels with a FWHM ranging from 0 mm to 12 mm. The validity of the matched filter theorem is analyzed using the simulated data sets in Fig. 2. To this end, the FWHM that produced the highest sensitivity to detect a certain pathology is mapped against the size of this pathology. This is done for different levels of pathology, corresponding with an FA decrease of 10%, 13%, 16%, and 19%. A significant correlation is found between the optimal FWHM and the size of the pathologies when the data sets were smoothed with an anisotropic kernel (p<0.05 using the Spearman correlation test) and no correlation was found for the isotropic smoothing approach (p>>0.05). The sensitivity and the specificity of the VBA results are displayed in a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) plot in Fig. 3 for the different smoothing approaches, various kernel widths, and different levels of pathology, displaying the true positive rate (=sensitivity) as a function of the false positive rate (=100-specificity). In Fig. 4, VBA results are displayed on 10 axial slices for both smoothing approaches and different smoothing kernel widths. A level of pathology corresponding with an FA decrease of 19% was thereby introduced. The voxels that contain a ground truth pathology are colored in green, whereas the VBA results are colored in red. Consequently, the voxels in which the VBA results and the ground truth overlap are colored in yellow. A green, red, and yellow color thus represents the presence of false negative, false positive, and true positive results, respectively. Voxels in which the background FA values are displayed correspond with true negative results. Conclusion: Our results based on simulated DTI data sets indicate that the sensitivity as well as the specificity of the pathology detection are significantly reduced when the data sets are smoothed isotropically with a FWHM larger than 3 mm in a VBA study. Using simulated DTI data sets, we demonstrated that the use of anisotropic smoothing kernels can significantly increase the sensitivity and the specificity of detecting a pathology in a VBA study. We therefore suggest to apply an anisotropic smoothing method in DTI group studies to increase the SNR while preserving WM boundaries.

In spite of their prominent clinical significance, molecular targets of GCs and, consequently, the mechanisms of GC-resistance are still unclear. In the present study, we focussed on molecular mechanisms of GC cytotoxicity in T-ALL, and investigated GC-specific response in leukemic cells at transcriptional and cellular levels. To this end, T-ALL samples (n=14) were investigated for GC-specific gene expression changes before onset of apoptosis (10 Î¼M dexamethasone, 6 hr of incubation). Gene expression data obtained using Affymetrix HG Focus microarrays were normalized by variance stabilization on probe level, and genes consistently changed in GC-treated vs -untreated cells were identified using a SAM-like analysis of log ratios in an unbalanced permutation test. By these procedures, a group of 195 genes (false discovery rate = 0.005) was identified. Furthermore, the T-ALL samples were investigated for GC-specific apoptosis (10 Î¼M dexamethasone, 20 hr). Apoptotic response to dexamethasone was highly heterogeneous with an apoptosis rate varying from 0% to 56% and a mean value of 23% (assessed by annexin V/propidium iodide staining). To identify genes with the highest impact on GC-specific apoptosis, we investigated the correlation between GC-specific gene expression changes and apoptosis rate in T-ALL samples. Expression changes of 25 genes were found to correlate significantly with the rate of apoptosis (Spearman regression analysis; correlation coefficients rs=0.54â€“0.81, p",2004,Biology,"list(name = ""Leonid Karawajew"", ids = ""1875724""); list(name = ""Peter Rhein"", ids = ""2184125""); list(name = ""Dennis Kostka"", ids = ""143886914""); list(name = ""Rosemarie Hoffmann"", ids = ""31995344""); list(name = ""Martin Schrappe"", ids = ""49944905""); list(name = ""Rainer Spang"", ids = ""48692032""); list(name = ""W. -D.

Materials and Methods With institutional review board approval and after obtaining written informed consent, structural magnetic resonance imaging data were prospectively acquired in 115 patients with CS, 47 patients with PS, and 116 control subjects by using four imagers from three hospitals. Patients with stroke lesions in the left and right hemispheres were analyzed (timing of follow-up imaging: mean, 597 days; range, 180-2070 days). The gray matter volume (GMV) of each voxel was compared among the three groups while controlling for the effects of age, sex, and imager. Multiple comparisons were corrected by using a false discovery rate method for voxel-wise comparisons and by using the Bonferroni method for post hoc comparisons. Results Both patients with CS and patients with PS exhibited a GMV reduction (6.18%-8.23%) in the ipsilesional anterior insular cortex and a GMV increase (5.11%-11.73%) in the supplementary motor area relative to control subjects (P < .0013). Moreover, a GMV reduction was observed in the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex in all patients with CS (9.73%-10.41%) and in the cerebellum in all patients with PS (10.58%-15.81%). Additionally, a GMV increase was found in the precuneus in patients with PS with left lesions (17.23%) and in the middle frontal gyrus in patients with CS with right lesions (10.95%). Conclusion The different patterns of structural damage and reorganization in patients with CS versus those with PS may provide useful information in designing individualized rehabilitative strategies for these patients.

We compared untargeted high-resolution accurate mass (HRAM) orbitrap-based plasma metabolomic profiles of 31 T2D-DN (with estimated glomerular filtration rate â‰¤80â€‰mL/min/1.73â€‰m2), 29 T2D and 30 normal glucose tolerance (NGT) Indian men. Of the 939 plasma metabolites that were differentially abundant amongst the NGT, T2D and T2D-DN (ANOVA, False Discovery Rate â€“ FDR adjusted p-valueâ€‰<â€‰0.05), 48 were associated with T2D irrespective of the renal function of the subjects. Acyl ethanolamides and acetylcholine were decreased while monoacylglycerols (MAGs) and cortisol were elevated in both T2D and T2D-DN. Sixteen metabolites, including amino acid metabolites Imidazolelactate and N-Acetylornithine, changed significantly between NGT, T2D and T2D-DN. 192 metabolites were specifically dysregulated in T2D-DN (ratio â‰¥2 or â‰¤0.5 between T2D-DN and T2D, similar abundance in NGT and T2D). These included increased levels of multiple acylcarnitine and amino acid metabolites. We observed a significant dysregulation of amino acid and fatty acid metabolism in South Asian Indian male T2D-DN subjects. Unique to this study, we report a reduction in acyl ethanolamide levels in both T2D and T2D-DN males. Those with dysregulation in acyl ethanolamides, which are endogenous agonists of GPR119, are likely to exhibit improved glycemic control with GPR119 agonists.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sarita Devi"", ids = ""144710712""); list(name = ""Bajanai Nongkhlaw"", ids = ""1438630747""); list(name = ""M.

dcebe91bdb31938bf224d66a23d0e72ae1d1c2e8,P157-S Understanding Cisplatin Drug Resistance in Human Ovarian Cancer.,"Ovarian Cancer is the fifth leading cause of death from all cancers in women. Platinum-based chemotherapy is the primary treatment for ovarian cancer. Most patients with the disease are initially very responsive to chemotherapeutic treatment. However, the majority of ovarian cancer patients eventually relapses and becomes refractory to additional treatment. This drug-resistance is a major impediment to the successful treatment of ovarian cancer. To date the mechanisms of drug-resistance are poorly understood. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms in which drug-resistance is developed in ovarian cancer cells, global protein expression pattern changes in drug-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer cells need to be established. 
 
In this study, we approached ovarian cancer resistance using proteomics technology to quantitatively profile the global protein expression levels of two pairs of ovarian cancer cell lines, with cisplatin drug treatment. A2780 and 2008 human ovarian cancer cell lines were chosen as cisplatin-sensitive and A2780/CP and 2008/C13*5.25 were their resistant counterpart. Statistical analysis was carried out by ANOVA models and these were fit using Proc_Mixed in SAS. Through our efforts to identify those protein changes associated with cisplatin drug-resistance, we identified and quantified over ~2000 proteins where 855 proteins were identified with high confidence (Priority 1) and 760 of them showed significant expression changes (False Discovery Rate is less than 0.05). Based on the data that we obtained, we were able to select a panel of potential proteins that could play a role in cisplatin drug resistance. Inhibition assays targeting select proteins from our panel were carried out, to determine whether down-regulation of these proteins would be successful in reversing cisplatin resistance. Preliminary data showed a very promising effect in reversing the cisplatin resistance in the resistant cells when the combination of cisplatin and TETA, an inhibitor of antioxidant Superoxide dismutase (SOD1) protein, were used.",2007,Medicine,"list(name = ""David P.

c2f6adf385397feb9a0e575c2a7bc1c263e46533,Genetic Variation in Cell Death Genes and Risk of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,"BACKGROUND
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of solid tumours that constitute the 5(th) highest cause of cancer mortality in the United States and Canada. Poor control of cell death in lymphocytes can lead to autoimmune disease or cancer, making genes involved in programmed cell death of lymphocytes logical candidate genes for lymphoma susceptibility.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We tested for genetic association with NHL and NHL subtypes, of SNPs in lymphocyte cell death genes using an established population-based study. 17 candidate genes were chosen based on biological function, with 123 SNPs tested. These included tagSNPs from HapMap and novel SNPs discovered by re-sequencing 47 cases in genes for which SNP representation was judged to be low. The main analysis, which estimated odds ratios by fitting data to an additive logistic regression model, used European ancestry samples that passed quality control measures (569 cases and 547 controls). A two-tiered approach for multiple testing correction was used: correction for number of tests within each gene by permutation-based methodology, followed by correction for the number of genes tested using the false discovery rate.


RESULTS
Variant rs928883, near miR-155, showed an association (OR per A-allele: 2.80 [95% CI: 1.63-4.82]; p(F) = 0.027) with marginal zone lymphoma that is significant after correction for multiple testing.


CONCLUSIONS
This is the first reported association between a germline polymorphism at a miRNA locus and lymphoma.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Johanna M.

9137dd99f7de02f8dcae8111b44167525edbeaac,False discovery rate: setting the probability of false claim of detection,"When testing multiple hypotheses in a surveyâ€”e.g. many different source locations, template waveforms, and so onâ€”the final result consists of a set of confidence intervals, each one at a desired confidence level. But the probability that at least one of these intervals does not cover the true value increases with the number of trials. With a sufficiently large array of confidence intervals, one can be sure that at least one is missing the true value. In particular, the probability of false claim of detection becomes non-negligible. In order to compensate for this, one should increase the confidence level, at the price of reduced detection power. False discovery rate control (Benjamini Y and Hochberg Y 1995 J. R. Stat. Soc.

Following class-level testing, it is naturally of interest to identify the lower level units which contain true signals. Testing the individual units within a class without taking into account the fact that the class was selected using an aggregate-level test-statistic, will produce biased inference. We develop a hypothesis testing framework that guarantees control for false positive rates conditional on the fact that the class was selected. Specifically, we develop procedures for calculating unit level p-values that allows rejection of null hypotheses controlling for two types of conditional error rates, one relating to family-wise rate and the other relating to false discovery rate. We use simulation studies to illustrate validity and power of the proposed procedure in comparison to several possible alternatives.

Glucose metabolism becomes progressively impaired with older age. Fasting glucose and insulin resistance are risk factors for premature death and other adverse outcomes. We aimed to identifying plasma metabolites associated with altered glucose metabolism and insulin resistance in older community-dwelling adults.


Participants and Methods
A targeted metabolomics approach was used to identify plasma metabolites associated with impaired fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose on oral glucose tolerance testing, and homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in 472 participants who participated in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, with a mean (SD) age of 70.7 (9.9) years.


Results
We measured 143 plasma metabolites. In ordinal logistic regression analyses, using a false discovery rate of 5% and adjusting for potential confounders, we found that alanine, glutamic acid, and proline were significantly associated with increased odds of abnormal fasting plasma glucose. Phosphatidylcholine (diacyl C34:4, alkyl-acyl C32:1, C32:2, C34:2, C34:3, and C36:3) was associated with decreased odds of abnormal fasting plasma glucose. Glutamic and acid phosphatidylcholine alkyl-acyl C34:2 were associated with increased and decreased odds of 2-hour plasma glucose, respectively. Glutamic acid was associated with increased odds of higher tertiles of HOMA-IR. Glycine; phosphatidylcholine (diacyl C32:0, alkyl-acyl C32:1, C32:2, C34:1, C34:2, C34:3, C36:2, C36:3, C40:5, C40:6, C42:3, C42:4, and C42:5); sphingomyelin C16:0, C24:1, and C26:1; and lysophosphatidylcholine C18:1 were associated with decreased odds of abnormal HOMA-IR.


Conclusions
Targeted metabolomics identified four plasma amino acids and 16 plasma lipid species, primarily containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, that were associated with abnormal glucose metabolism and insulin resistance in older adults.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Richard David Semba"", ids = ""4040013""); list(name = ""Marta GonzÃ¡lez-Freire"", ids = ""1382492645""); list(name = ""Ruin Moaddel"", ids = ""4354482""); list(name = ""Kai Sun"", ids = ""145932997""); list(name = ""Elisa Fabbri"", ids = ""5638874""); list(name = ""Pingbo Zhang"", ids = ""40188004""); list(name = ""Olga D Carlson"", ids = ""4247939""); list(name = ""Mohammed Abdul Khadeer"", ids = ""4022838""); list(name = ""Chee W.

01f7eb74f1e691042c849e329efd9e54c486efe6,Genomic responses to selection for tame/aggressive behaviors in the silver fox (Vulpes vulpes).,"Animal domestication efforts have led to a shared spectrum of striking behavioral and morphological changes. To recapitulate this process, silver foxes have been selectively bred for tame and aggressive behaviors for more than 50 generations at the Institute for Cytology and Genetics in Novosibirsk, Russia. To understand the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypic changes, we profiled gene expression levels and coding SNP allele frequencies in two brain tissue specimens from 12 aggressive foxes and 12 tame foxes. Expression analysis revealed 146 genes in the prefrontal cortex and 33 genes in the basal forebrain that were differentially expressed, with a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). These candidates include genes in key pathways known to be critical to neurologic processing, including the serotonin and glutamate receptor pathways. In addition, 295 of the 31,000 exonic SNPs show significant allele frequency differences between the tame and aggressive populations (1% FDR), including genes with a role in neural crest cell fate determination.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Xu Wang"", ids = ""40290899""); list(name = ""Lenore Pipes"", ids = ""2900427""); list(name = ""Lyudmila N.

9ce3dfdc50006f237222cd544441be038540d5fd,Dysfunctional adaptive immune response in adolescents and young adults with suicide behavior,"BACKGROUND
Immune system dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of suicide behavior. Here, we conducted an exploratory analysis of immune profile differences of three groups of adolescents and young adults (ages 10-25 years): healthy controls (nâ€‰=â€‰39), at risk of major depressive disorder (MDD; at-risk, nâ€‰=â€‰33), and MDD with recent suicide behavior/ ideation (suicide behavior, nâ€‰=â€‰37).


METHODS
Plasma samples were assayed for chemokines and cytokines using Bio-Plex Pro Human Chemokine 40-plex assay. Log-transformed cytokine and chemokine levels were compared after controlling for age, gender, body mass index, race, ethnicity, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. In post-hoc analyses to understand the effect of dysregulated immune markers identified in this exploratory analysis, their association with autoantibodies was tested in an unrelated sample (nâ€‰=â€‰166).


RESULTS
Only levels of interleukin 4 (IL-4) differed significantly among the three groups [false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted pâ€‰=â€‰0.0007]. Participants with suicide behavior had lower IL-4 [medianâ€‰=â€‰16.8â€‰pg/ml, interquartile range (IQR)â€‰=â€‰7.9] levels than healthy controls (medianâ€‰=â€‰29.1â€‰pg/ml, IQRâ€‰=â€‰16.1, effect size [ES]â€‰=â€‰1.30) and those at-risk (medianâ€‰=â€‰24.4â€‰pg/ml, IQRâ€‰=â€‰16.3, ESâ€‰=â€‰1.03). IL-4 levels were negatively correlated with depression severity (r= -0.38, pâ€‰=â€‰0.024). In an unrelated sample of outpatients with MDD, levels of IL-4 were negatively correlated (all FDR pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) with several autoantibodies [54/117 in total and 12/18 against innate immune markers].


CONCLUSIONS
Adolescent and young adult patients with recent suicide behavior exhibit lower IL-4 levels. One biological consequence of reduced IL-4 levels may be increased risk of autoimmunity.",2020,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Manish Jha"", ids = ""34392403""); list(name = ""Ling Cai"", ids = ""2124258""); list(name = ""Abu Minhajuddin"", ids = ""79787269""); list(name = ""Cherise R.

57cca95fdbd35ba1b283c9c6ec5ae7a81be7adfd,Panning for Gold: Model-free Knockoffs for High-dimensional Controlled Variable Selection,"Many contemporary large-scale applications involve building interpretable models linking a large set of potential covariates to a response in a nonlinear fashion, such as when the response is binary. Although this modeling problem has been extensively studied, it remains unclear how to effectively control the fraction of false discoveries even in high-dimensional logistic regression, not to mention general high-dimensional nonlinear models. To address such a practical problem, we propose a new framework of $model$-$X$ knockoffs, which reads from a different perspective the knockoff procedure (Barber and Cand\`es, 2015) originally designed for controlling the false discovery rate in linear models. Whereas the knockoffs procedure is constrained to homoscedastic linear models with $n\ge p$, the key innovation here is that model-X knockoffs provide valid inference from finite samples in settings in which the conditional distribution of the response is arbitrary and completely unknown. Furthermore, this holds no matter the number of covariates. Correct inference in such a broad setting is achieved by constructing knockoff variables probabilistically instead of geometrically. To do this, our approach requires the covariates be random (independent and identically distributed rows) with a distribution that is known, although we provide preliminary experimental evidence that our procedure is robust to unknown/estimated distributions. To our knowledge, no other procedure solves the $controlled$ variable selection problem in such generality, but in the restricted settings where competitors exist, we demonstrate the superior power of knockoffs through simulations. Finally, we apply our procedure to data from a case-control study of Crohn's disease in the United Kingdom, making twice as many discoveries as the original analysis of the same data.",2016,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Emmanuel J.

ddad7f09ea72636ebea9d192892357dbac01091b,A lipidomic study of sphingolipid species in human synovial fluid,"s / Osteoarthritis and Cartilage 22 (2014) S57â€“S489 S425 donors. Many of these proteins are cartilage specific proteoglycans such as hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1, aggrecan core protein or lumican as well as some proteins with a well-known role in the pathogenesis of OA like COMP or MMP3. On the other hand, 21 proteins exhibited a significantly reduced abundance in OA patients when compared to controls. Interestingly, we detected several proteins which belong to the tenascin protein family, like tenascin-X, which accelerates collagen fibril formation. We also found WISP2 decreased at day 14, suggesting a lower activity of the Wnt signaling pathway in OA cells. Conclusions: The identification and quantification of these secreted proteins enhance our knowledge on the extracellular regulation of the chondrogenesis and allow the identification of extracellular markers of this process. Moreover, the lower expression of some of them in OA patients (like tenascin-X or WISP2), suggest their putative usefulness for the molecular monitorization of the chondrogenesis in cell therapybased approaches for cartilage repair. 766 A LIPIDOMIC STUDY OF SPHINGOLIPID SPECIES IN HUMAN SYNOVIAL FLUID M.K.

Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany; x Internistisches Praxiszentrum am Krankenhaus Balserische Stiftung, Giessen, Germany Purpose: Articular synovial fluid (SF) is a complex mixture of components either derived from plasma or locally synthesized by synovial tissues, which are involved in nutrition, communication, shock absorption, and lubrication. Alterations in its composition can be associated with increased friction, leading to articular cartilage damage, or with changes in inflammatory status of synovial joints. We already quantified 130 phospholipid species in human osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) SF. The presented lipidomic investigation aims to quantify for the first time, the composition of sphingolipids [sphingomyelins (SM), ceramides (Cer), hexosylceramides (HexCer) and dihexosylceramides (Hex2Cer) species] in the SF of knee joints from unaffected controls, patients with early (eOA) and late (lOA) stages of OA and from RA patients, and to further elucidate whether the concentrations of individual lipid species are associated with the stage of OA disease. Methods: According to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria patients were included in the study. The use of human SF for this study was approved by the local ethics committee of our university, and all participants provided written informed consent. Lipids were extracted from SF without cells and cellular debris from 9 postmortem donors (control), 18 RA, and 30 OA patients. OA group was subcategorized as early (n 1â„4 17) and late (n 1â„4 13) using Outerbridge score. RA patients were classified according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. Lipids were quantified using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry directly or coupled with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. The quantitative values of all lipid species were corrected by the method described by Kraus et al. (2002). The Kruskal-Wallis test adjusted with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 10% and the Wilcoxon rank sum test were applied to determine statistically significant differences. P values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results: We provide a novel, detailed overview of sphingolipid species in human SF. The analytical set-up used in the present study allowed us to quantitate 35 different sphingolipid species. We identified 19 SM species, based on the length and saturation of the attached fatty acids. SM 34:1 was the predominant species among SMs. In addition, versus control SF, all species were elevated in eOA, lOA and RA SF. Remarkably, all SM species rose approximately 2-fold in SF from eOA to lOA and approximately 1.5-fold in SF from eOA to RA. However, we found no significant different levels of SM species in lOA compared with RA SF. Also, 6 Cer, 5 HexCer and 5 Hex2Cer were identified in human SF. Cer d18:0/24 was the predominant species. Moreover, most Cer species contained saturated fatty acids in all cohorts. Compared to control SF, the levels of most Cer species were 4.5-fold higher in lOA and 5.8-fold in RA SF. Moreover, all Cer species rose approximately 1.7-fold in SF from eOA to RA, and nearly 1.3-fold in SF from lOA to RA. Conclusions: This lipidomic investigation present for the first time a detailed overview of sphingolipid species in human SF. Compared to control SF the concentrations of sphingolipid species such as SM and Cer were found to be elevated in eOA, lOA and RA SF. Since, disease and stage-dependent differences in the composition and concentrations of lipid species might result not only in an impaired lubrication but also in an altered inflammatory status of joints, sphingolipids appear to be associated with the pathogenesis of OA and RA. Our study lays the foundation for addressing specific questions regarding the biosynthesis and function of sphingolipid species in SF. 767 IDENTIFICATION OF AUTOANTIBODIES IN SERUM FROM OSTEOARTHRITIS PATIENTS USING MICROARRAYS L.

c6d968b4dbd3f7890692da354241991bbcd985a7,Targeted sequencing to identify novel genetic risk factors for deep vein thrombosis: a study of 734 genes,"Essentials Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has a large unknown genetic component. We sequenced coding areas of 734 hemostasis-related genes in 899 DVT patients and 599 controls. Variants in F5, FGA-FGG, CYP4V2-KLKB1-F11, and ABO were associated with DVT risk. Associations in KLKB1 and F5 suggest a more complex genetic architecture than previously thought. SUMMARY: Background Although several genetic risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are known, almost all related to hemostasis, a large genetic component remains unexplained. Objectives To identify novel genetic determinants by using targeted DNA sequencing. Patients/Methods We included 899 DVT patients and 599 controls from three case-control studies (DVT-Milan, Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of risk factors for venous thrombosis [MEGA], and the Thrombophilia, Hypercoagulability and Environmental Risks in Venous Thromboembolism [THE-VTE] study) for sequencing of the coding regions of 734 genes involved in hemostasis or related pathways. We performed single-variant association tests for common variants (minor allele frequency [MAF] â‰¥ 1%) and gene-based tests for rare variants (MAF â‰¤ 1%), accounting for multiple testing by use of the false discovery rate (FDR). Results Sixty-two of 3617 common variants were associated with DVT risk (FDR < 0.10). Most of these mapped to F5,ABO,FGA-FGG, and CYP4V2-KLKB1-F11. The lead variant at F5 was rs6672595 (odds ratio [OR] 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-1.92), in moderate linkage with the known variant rs4524. Reciprocal conditional analyses suggested that intronic variation might drive this association. We also observed a secondary association at the F11 region: missense KLKB1 variant rs3733402 remained associated conditional on known variants rs2039614 and rs2289252 (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.10-1.69). Two novel variant associations were observed, in CBS and MASP1, but these were not replicated in the meta-analysis data from the International Network against Thrombosis (INVENT) consortium. There was no support for a burden of rare variants contributing to DVT risk (FDR > 0.2). Conclusions We confirmed associations between DVT and common variants in F5,ABO,FGA-FGG, and CYP4V2-KLKB1-F11, and observed secondary signals in F5 and CYP4V2-KLKB1-F11 that warrant replication and fine-mapping in larger studies.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hugoline G de Haan"", ids = ""32385418""); list(name = ""Astrid van Hylckama Vlieg"", ids = ""5452903""); list(name = ""Luca Andrea Lotta"", ids = ""4123328""); list(name = ""M M Gorski"", ids = ""50398937""); list(name = ""Paolo Bucciarelli"", ids = ""2453830""); list(name = ""Ida Martinelli"", ids = ""144544839""); list(name = ""Trevor P.

cc64c40a07c12f5fd6e35787bb9be7362d39d150,The Growth Curve Model for High Dimensional Data and its Application in Genomics,"Recent advances in technology have allowed researchers to collect high-dimensional biological data simultaneously. In genomic studies, for instance, measurements from tens of thousands of genes are taken from individuals across several experimental groups. In time course microarray experiments, gene expression is measured at several time points for each individual across the whole genome resulting in massive amount of data. In such experiments, researchers are faced with two types of high-dimensionality. The first is global high-dimensionality, which is common to all genomic experiments. The global high-dimensionality arises because inference is being done on tens of thousands of genes resulting in multiplicity. This challenge is often dealt with statistical methods for multiple comparison, such as the Bonferroni correction or false discovery rate (FDR). We refer to the second type of high-dimensionality as gene specific high-dimensionality, which arises in time course microarry experiments due to the fact that, in such experiments, sample size is often smaller than the number of time points (n < p), leading to singular covariance matrix. Moreover, singularity also arises in such experiments due to the fact that the change across time is small compared to between individual variability. Unfortunately, traditional methods for longitudinal data are not appropriate when n < p. In this thesis, we use the growth curve model (GCM), which is a generalized multivariate",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sayantee Jana"", ids = ""32001772"")",256fa08997e2baefc32346e636ca3dc9b8fa6ff7,948924ea62c6f5fed15ab9e7a602cca1910dbd3f; 67ab1ba9c85adaeff5db03658d34b1478f5849f5; fa3611acf748674c9e74727cf2fbf45b55648d1f; d482a28d8c071dda832f4176ffdfbbf4e5b08e2b; 7317fb319376e75d29f4ce52c216f6269cdf2eda; e435cd0d6d7bde2569079ff72ba64b5f73a7b9b7; cfc36464bd56c7395d27712a0e03bf2bf06342a6; 7247f10f83e1255bec33c732006f026b1b674dc8; a894da2a423536d07e8841b6096623dbc19c9067; fd33ce234490230cab7f92068ae45cea24ff9009; aa3c789f5b1d48d3782fe3e2ca0572d4e0315645; bd921b069661832d9ef6ae115b3e4a74f4cbd5a9; 17d6135ecff6a184c800df65b5e0f42a53a5c1dd; f82391f4a85843be7a6c2b6c4b79a57ca7895530; f55c9bc3b58be5f4fc0f8a555a776838a82b0119; 34229d94fb3b4c6d2fa85f074421d604ec60f571; aa2c45c7cae017f09566a0003a2dcffc650008fd; 971ba4e36e2cc23d858cabd9c09650c8209ee536; fc030858aa334b4885e02c64ac761a0e6e3c687a; b5094900afbe60ec3a60f7951a3960cddee393bf; 3157fbf21c6e7055b5d7144a49499670836de4a0; a5373c3d35045ecb52ec8edfb16384af6877f963; d7731e6241b717c8af01c73107df2498e2bd1706; e708166a2cc20322eae60dcdeb0725487df81a69; b1a4036113f36ec17ac3ae2474219ecc5a3e0ddd; 512989c02ba7659f49cfeb858ca548a9d0e65db5; 83e4390ec7dc8228dc33117efdedee1aad7e1041; 72b450d9c008ffc6d31bde5c44202c59280c4ce7; 2a8d86db06ea7418a81c35b675c5408e9b7e29ec; 9e26c8be21f341102016fa5a67b06db362bf272a; 8492ac2f0ddf76dd1731ac16434c76c3bb04b70d; 13bac55457eec67fd79a2ace4ffcb11f09cdb20a; f169a74052415f615a5c00f85c9496e5c5b1a46c; 0fa60bf8cd3d6c2785dbaf0e75f7b16e5aad6580; ce190107acab28c2c0d7132c3ec9a14fb1b0c739; 387d0769a5fd5501e18339cf0d07068cdae4cbbb; 998ccbd3898a21f2e4d090b34ca201f8a07fe6d6,,,

44a345811a2a58976de086ebe28a7924362a28ec,Proteomic Analysis of Purified Dog Cardiac Sacroplasmic Reticulum Membrane Subcompartments,"Ca2+ homeostasis primarily involves two major morphological subdivisions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR): junctional (jSR) cisterna that appose sarcolemma, and free (fSR) tubules surrounding myofilaments. Biochemical isolation of jSR and fSR membranes involves selective increases in density of SR membrane vesicles using the SR Ca2+ pump (SERCA2a) (Jones and Cala, J. Biol. Chem. 1981). The purpose of the current study was to comprehensively characterize cardiac SR subproteomes. Purified SR membranes were solubilized, trypsinized and analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a LTQ-XL mass spectrometer. Abundant species were fragmented with collision-induced dissociation (CID). Data analysis was performed using Proteome Discoverer 1.1 (Thermo) which incorporated the Mascot algorithm (Matrix Science). In replicate experiments, a total of 199 junctional SR and 191 free SR proteins were identified from 16,344 MSMS spectra with protein false discovery rate (FDR) at 0.8% and peptide FDR at 0.0%. SERCA2a was the most abundant protein in both fractions, as expected, and virtually all of the known cardiac SR proteins were also identified. In jSR, the major 4 components of the Ca2+-release complex were found exclusively, including calsequestrin-2, ryanodine receptor 2 and 3, triadin, and junctin. Another 57 proteins were also identified as specific to this subcompartment. In fSR, 53 proteins were exclusively identified. Relative enrichments in one of the SR subcompartments were found for an additional 86 proteins, and 52 additional proteins were identified in the cardiac SR, without obvious subcompartment origin.

3eb7600f64eb9538d2cac91e11d3b02bc05b434b,"Genome-wide association study for behavior , type traits , and muscular development in charolais beef cattle 1","Behavior, type traits, and muscular development are of interest for beef cattle breeding. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) enable the identification of candidate genes, which enables genebased selection and provides insight in the genetic architecture of these traits. The objective of the current study was to perform a GWAS for 3 behavior traits, 12 type traits, and muscular development in Charolais cattle. Behavior traits, including aggressiveness at parturition, aggressiveness during gestation period, and maternal care, were scored by farmers. Type traits, including udder conformation, teat, feet and legs, and locomotion, were scored by trained classifiers. Data used in the GWAS consisted of 3,274 cows with phenotypic records and genotyping information for 44,930 SNP. When SNP had a false discovery rate (FDR) smaller than 0.05, they were referred to as significant. When SNP had a FDR between 0.05 and 0.20, they were referred to as suggestive. Four significant and 12 suggestive regions were detected for aggressiveness during gestation, maternal care, udder balance, teat thinness, teat length, foot angle, foot depth, and locomotion. These 4 significant and 12 suggestive regions were not supported by other significant SNP in close proximity. No SNP with major effects were detected for behavior and type traits, and SNP associations for these traits were spread across the genome, suggesting that behavior and type traits were influenced by many genes, each explaining a small part of genetic variance. The GWAS identified 1 region on chromosome 2 significantly associated with muscular development, which included the myostatin gene (GDF8), which is known to affect muscularity. No other regions associated with muscular development were found. Results showed that the myostatin region associated with muscular development had pleiotropic effects on udder volume, teat thinness, rear leg, and leg angle.",2016,,"list(name = ""Anne VallÃ©e"", ids = ""40505747""); list(name = ""Josiane Daures"", ids = ""47151801""); list(name = ""Johan A.M. van Arendonk"", ids = ""8121782""); list(name = ""Henk Bovenhuis"", ids = ""89590441"")",,99931dc179c0540be7111befb8c8cf2ec301d492; 9f7b95a3708435933911ee86eef3117afb83f8a9; e6e3fe23aefe423dc45837e553a1d5918c2c3d38; 0cec55696cbdeded5dbef4a1fb3b3372fa64ed4a; d9f992b483f6a73bed5741efcba7421fcf68c630; f87d9cf13b45d41a0224433ad1695746f972bcce; 70b280cc4e175d4f4888613eb660fe77bcff3ac6; 61502052329e29081ab7d9273eb446847e5a534c; ff546bac418138dadcd9dfa3636e6ef2f8b2d8b1; 53bcbc886a1b7aab000db03b6d088c323326ce7b; a67cd5ddc5c737f7c54579923f8cc250ae2cd45b; c2652a4eb7abebfbc207b588c05e6bae4a475c99; b26a2026275b3f5fbdbbd866f067a20e5202ef6c; faa668fa49e9e8f565289c226b63333a6eef070a; 48a42ffa4983a0c93b84a7840d0b7f27edbc5ece; beeb88e1de17de139d5844a2b90e27c03ae615f1; a6ee554d31f8a77f652c0f36a17c8bf96dae9ad1; 50581025601fe8fa9e50172ce03e9e52604b57e0; 5588eb5325bd31acefe06079ba5216f53d28e7a4; ba6a8e959d5d1559a1068a0ed60a42e39e3de543; 1ea40d680e4f42c99ade9dad79e0a977580ac335; 64d8d262260a3fda742ef3261e6c404b1803f326; 1de727ed3804940a571766d9301acc433749ef80; 308df26c2ed8198a5c49bea7a75c5ec86d63bcec; 258ccd60a113b4402fc5bdff0dc552080845638a; 30f4abf495614e13ba5103bfe1b13c2b7b4b35dc; 39563e2fcdb07b58ffcbc95baf46c4e4ecda499c; 8cd3d1c70cd6e0ec5bd2e7c47debeecde20a95e4; 21b25ee99424d7a1809e53d306b98ebd09ffbb65; 0ed73bd7dc3222bd8e2c13716d181aa0d04e389b; 61c0c33be59a2c4afefafcadb364242d7f582346; 4a6637c0bee33a40d7cbe0f72ad550747779fa82; d714b74329f696d80b14084f15f486942febce68; 60174277dcb677931714a209df924c13d37712cf; 4399936fab1000c783a348615b594dc2c31bd480; 7e21492c10a1b2324d0d41b498c8c2a97fad3714; 32eb579711cec80918a05f6106433bd1067be162; b554a963621c3972d3de25c9672a866b4514dc04,,,

However, certain methodological shortcomings, including a lack of partial volume effect (PVE) correction or insufficient cognitive testing, confound the interpretation of most studies on this topic. We combined [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to quantify cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRg) as well as cortical volume and thickness in 43 anatomically defined brain regions from a group of cognitively normal younger (25 Â± 3 yr old; n = 25) and older adults (71 Â± 9 yr old; n = 31). After correcting for PVE, we observed 11-17% lower CMRg in three specific brain regions of the older group: the superior frontal cortex, the caudal middle frontal cortex, and the caudate (P â‰¤ 0.01 false discovery rate-corrected). In the older group, cortical volumes and cortical thickness were 13-33 and 7-18% lower, respectively, in multiple brain regions (P â‰¤ 0.01 FDR correction). There were no differences in CMRg between individuals who were or were not prescribed antihypertensive medication. There were no significant correlations between CMRg and cognitive performance or metabolic parameters measured in fasting plasma. We conclude that highly localized glucose hypometabolism and widespread cortical thinning and atrophy can be present in older adults who are cognitively normal, as assessed using age-normed neuropsychological testing measures.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Scott Nugent"", ids = ""144718565""); list(name = ""Christian-Alexandre Castellano"", ids = ""35353235""); list(name = ""Philippe Goffaux"", ids = ""152584401""); list(name = ""Kevin Whittingstall"", ids = ""1980161""); list(name = ""Martin Lepage"", ids = ""144871868""); list(name = ""Nancy Paquet"", ids = ""2716030""); list(name = ""Christian Bocti"", ids = ""47456475""); list(name = ""TamÃ s Fulop"", ids = ""48971957""); list(name = ""Stephen C.

f400ac1a44fada5c92a74a6f7c6f6bf83be1f6f4,An epigenetic clock for human skeletal muscle.,"BACKGROUND
Ageing is associated with DNA methylation changes in all human tissues, and epigenetic markers can estimate chronological age based on DNA methylation patterns across tissues. However, the construction of the original pan-tissue epigenetic clock did not include skeletal muscle samples and hence exhibited a strong deviation between DNA methylation and chronological age in this tissue.


METHODS
To address this, we developed a more accurate, muscle-specific epigenetic clock based on the genome-wide DNA methylation data of 682 skeletal muscle samples from 12 independent datasets (18-89 years old, 22% women, 99% Caucasian), all generated with Illumina HumanMethylation (HM) arrays (HM27, HM450, or HMEPIC). We also took advantage of the large number of samples to conduct an epigenome-wide association study of age-associated DNA methylation patterns in skeletal muscle.


RESULTS
The newly developed clock uses 200 cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides to estimate chronological age in skeletal muscle, 16 of which are in common with the 353 cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides of the pan-tissue clock. The muscle clock outperformed the pan-tissue clock, with a median error of only 4.6 years across datasets (vs. 13.1 years for the pan-tissue clock, P < 0.0001) and an average correlation of Ï = 0.62 between actual and predicted age across datasets (vs. Ï = 0.51 for the pan-tissue clock). Lastly, we identified 180 differentially methylated regions with age in skeletal muscle at a false discovery rate < 0.005. However, gene set enrichment analysis did not reveal any enrichment for gene ontologies.


CONCLUSIONS
We have developed a muscle-specific epigenetic clock that predicts age with better accuracy than the pan-tissue clock. We implemented the muscle clock in an r package called Muscle Epigenetic Age Test available on Bioconductor to estimate epigenetic age in skeletal muscle samples. This clock may prove valuable in assessing the impact of environmental factors, such as exercise and diet, on muscle-specific biological ageing processes.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sarah Voisin"", ids = ""50856314""); list(name = ""Nicholas R Harvey"", ids = ""1473682401""); list(name = ""L.

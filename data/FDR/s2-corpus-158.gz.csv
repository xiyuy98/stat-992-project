af00f2b825ec5971bc66fea9a862add3357cabd4,Gene expression changes in the mesenteric lymph nodes of rats after oral peanut extract exposure.,"New techniques are needed to broaden the understanding of the food allergic response. The capacity of peanut extract to influence gene expression profiles was investigated in a Brown Norway rat model for food allergy. Brown Norway rats were sensitized to peanut extract (0, 1 and 10 mg/rat/d) by daily oral gavage and were dissected after 3, 7 or 14 days of exposure. RNA extracted from mesenteric lymph nodes of individual rats were hybridized against a common reference pool on Agilent whole rat genome (4*44k) arrays. The raw data were normalized and statistically analyzed using the statistical program R. A False Discovery Rate of 10% and a Fold Ratio of - 1.5 < or = Fold Ratio or Fold Ratio > or = 1.5 between the experimental groups and their respective control groups were applied. Differentially expressed genes were clustered into a heatmap. Functional annotation and GeneOntology term enrichment were examined. Furthermore, the involvement of the differentially expressed genes in specific cellular pathways was investigated with MetaCore. Gene expression changes, which were both dose- and time-dependent, were detected after sensitization to peanut. A total of 64 genes were differentially expressed, of which 60 were up-regulated and four were down-regulated. These changes were related to the regulation of immunological processes, most notably increased cell division. The findings indicate that responses to peanut include proliferation of immunologically relevant tissues, which can be identified by analysis of gene expression profiles. This may lay a basis for further research into possibilities for discrimination of allergenic from non-allergenic proteins.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jonathan D de Jonge"", ids = ""13207260""); list(name = ""Jeroen L.

eae34e9e171863b44856ed497f250aaa7201a4d6,Genetic polymorphisms in the one-carbon metabolism pathway and breast cancer risk: a population-based case-control study and meta-analyses.,"Epidemiological evidence suggests that intake of folate and other B-vitamins and genetic variants in the one-carbon metabolism pathway could influence the risk of breast cancer. Previous studies have focused on 2 polymorphisms in the methylenetetrahydrofolate gene (MTHFR A222V and E429A); however, findings are inconclusive. In a large population-based case-control study in Poland (2,386 cases, 2,502 controls), we investigated the association between breast cancer risk and 13 polymorphisms in 6 one-carbon metabolism genes (MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, CBS, SHMT1 and SLC19A1). Data suggested an association between a nonsynonymous change in the gene coding for methionine synthase (MTR D919G) and reduced breast cancer risk: OR (95% CI) = 0.84 (0.73-0.96) and 0.85 (0.62-1.15) for heterozygous and homozygote variant genotypes, respectively, compared with common homozygotes; p-trend = 0.01, false discovery rate = 0.14. We found no significant associations between other variants and breast cancer risk, including MTHFR A222V or E429A. Meta-analyses including published studies of MTHFR A222V (8,330 cases and 10,825 controls) and E429A (6,521 cases and 8,515 controls) supported the lack of an overall association; however, studies suggested an increase in risk among premenopausal women. In conclusion, this report does not support a substantial overall association between the evaluated polymorphisms in the one-carbon metabolism pathway and breast cancer risk.",2007,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jolanta Lissowska"", ids = ""6778489""); list(name = ""Mia M Gaudet"", ids = ""1778700""); list(name = ""Louise A Brinton"", ids = ""5405917""); list(name = ""Stephen J.

2f7c79a72eaab197be7fa3f97df86f1c5eb48792,"Sex Steroid Hormone Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms, Pesticide Use, and the Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Nested Caseâ€“Control Study within the Agricultural Health Study","Experimental and epidemiologic investigations suggest that certain pesticides may alter sex steroid hormone synthesis, metabolism or regulation, and the risk of hormone-related cancers. Here, we evaluated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in hormone homeostasis alter the effect of pesticide exposure on prostate cancer risk. We evaluated pesticide-SNP interactions between 39 pesticides and SNPs with respect to prostate cancer among 776 cases and 1,444 controls nested in the Agricultural Health Study cohort. In these interactions, we included candidate SNPs involved in hormone synthesis, metabolism or regulation (Nâ€‰=â€‰1,100), as well as SNPs associated with circulating sex steroid concentrations, as identified by genome-wide association studies (Nâ€‰=â€‰17). Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multiplicative SNP-pesticide interactions were calculated using a likelihood ratio test. We translated p-values for interaction into q-values, which reflected the false discovery rate, to account for multiple comparisons. We observed a significant interaction, which was robust to multiple comparison testing, between the herbicide dicamba and rs8192166 in the testosterone metabolizing gene SRD5A1 (p-interactionâ€‰=â€‰4.0â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5; q-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.03), such that men with two copies of the wild-type genotype CC had a reduced risk of prostate cancer associated with low use of dicamba (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.62 95% CI: 0.41, 0.93) and high use of dicamba (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.44, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.68), compared to those who reported no use of dicamba; in contrast, there was no significant association between dicamba and prostate cancer among those carrying one or two copies of the variant T allele at rs8192166. In addition, interactions between two organophosphate insecticides and SNPs related to estradiol metabolism were observed to result in an increased risk of prostate cancer. While replication is needed, these data suggest both agonistic and antagonistic effects on circulating hormones, due to the combination of exposure to pesticides and genetic susceptibility, may impact prostate cancer risk.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Carol H.

aa212799489a97943f1deeb9e2521aca6dd1ad82,Nested PCR detection of Plasmodium malariae from microscopy confirmed P. falciparum samples in endemic area of NE India.,"The present study evaluates the performance of OptiMAL-IT test and nested PCR assay in detection of malaria parasites. A total of 76 randomly selected blood samples collected from two malaria endemic areas were tested for malaria parasites using microscopy and OptiMAL-IT test in the field. PCR assays were performed in the laboratory using DNA extracted from blood spots of the same samples collected on the FTA classic cards. Of the total of 61 field confirmed malaria positive samples, only 58 (95%) were detected positive using microscopy in the laboratory. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and false discovery rate of OptiMal-IT in comparison to the microscopy were 93%, 83%, 95%, 79% and 5%, respectively. On the other hand, the sensitivity and specificity of PCR assay were 97% and 100%, respectively, whereas positive predictive value, negative predictive value and false discovery rate were 100%, 90% and 0%, respectively. The overall performance of OptiMal-IT and PCR assays for malaria diagnosis was 76% and 97%, respectively.

da618de550351682bbf2a100712ec8681e892191,Adjusting multiple testing in multilocus analyses using the eigenvalues of a correlation matrix,"Correlated multiple testing is widely performed in genetic research, particularly in multilocus analyses of complex diseases. Failure to control appropriately for the effect of multiple testing will either result in a flood of false-positive claims or in true hits being overlooked. Cheverud proposed the idea of adjusting correlated tests as if they were independent, according to an â€˜effective numberâ€™ (Meff) of independent tests. However, our experience has indicated that Cheverud's estimate of the Meff is overly large and will lead to excessively conservative results. We propose a more accurate estimate of the Meff, and design Meff-based procedures to control the experiment-wise significant level and the false discovery rate. In an evaluation, based on both real and simulated data, the Meff-based procedures were able to control the error rate accurately and consequently resulted in a power increase, especially in multilocus analyses. The results confirm that the Meff is a useful concept in the error-rate control of correlated tests. With its efficiency and accuracy, the Meff method provides an alternative to computationally intensive methods such as the permutation test.",2005,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jian Li"", ids = ""47785970"");

be14c56689603b297e5429a8fe1ecee695cd77c7,SAFFRON: an adaptive algorithm for online control of the false discovery rate,"In the online false discovery rate (FDR) problem, one observes a possibly infinite sequence of $p$-values $P_1,P_2,\dots$, each testing a different null hypothesis, and an algorithm must pick a sequence of rejection thresholds $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots$ in an online fashion, effectively rejecting the $k$-th null hypothesis whenever $P_k \leq \alpha_k$. Importantly, $\alpha_k$ must be a function of the past, and cannot depend on $P_k$ or any of the later unseen $p$-values, and must be chosen to guarantee that for any time $t$, the FDR up to time $t$ is less than some pre-determined quantity $\alpha \in (0,1)$. In this work, we present a powerful new framework for online FDR control that we refer to as SAFFRON. Like older alpha-investing (AI) algorithms, SAFFRON starts off with an error budget, called alpha-wealth, that it intelligently allocates to different tests over time, earning back some wealth on making a new discovery. However, unlike older methods, SAFFRON's threshold sequence is based on a novel estimate of the alpha fraction that it allocates to true null hypotheses. In the offline setting, algorithms that employ an estimate of the proportion of true nulls are called adaptive methods, and SAFFRON can be seen as an online analogue of the famous offline Storey-BH adaptive procedure. Just as Storey-BH is typically more powerful than the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure under independence, we demonstrate that SAFFRON is also more powerful than its non-adaptive counterparts, such as LORD and other generalized alpha-investing algorithms. Further, a monotone version of the original AI algorithm is recovered as a special case of SAFFRON, that is often more stable and powerful than the original.

681af1bd5b9a3cbf635cf2344925a933f5df3a00,Gene Expression Profiles of Hydroxyurea Tolerant Cell Lines Identify Genetic Mechanisms That Influence Hydroxyurea Maximum Tolerated Dose,"Abstract 1005 Hydroxyurea has emerged over the past decade as an effective therapeutic agent for patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). However, drug dosing and hematological responses can be highly variable; both %HbF response and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) vary widely among patients with SCA who receive hydroxyurea treatment. To obtain further insight into the cellular and molecular pathways, as well as genetic factors that might influence the hydroxyurea MTD, K562 erythroleukemia cells were exposed to hydroxyurea in vitro , to create cell lines that were highly drug tolerant to doses ranging from 250Î¼M to 1500Î¼M. Cell lines had dose-response curves that exhibited clear drug tolerance; naive K562 showed 50% proliferation in the presence of 250Î¼M hydroxyurea, while tolerant cell lines showed >90% proliferation at the same dose as measured by the BrdU Cell Proliferation Assay. In addition, the tolerant lines showed normal and equivalent progression through cell cycle by flow cytometry cell cycle analysis. After 15 weeks of continuous exposure, cells were harvested and mRNA microarray expression profiles were analyzed for naive K562 (no hydroxyurea exposure) and cell lines tolerant to 500, 1000, or 1500Î¼M hydroxyurea. Gene expression was measured on Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 chips. Differential expression between sample groups was determined using ANOVA, and p-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamin-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method to identify genetic profiles and genes consistently increased or decreased compared to naive K562 cells. Using a threshold of 2-fold change compared to untreated cells and a false discovery rate in vitro exposure of K562 cells to hydroxyurea leads to tolerant cell lines that feature substantial changes in gene expression. Altered expression of certain genes present in erythroid cells including RRM2 and membrane transporters represent compensatory changes in response to hydroxyurea exposure, and may help explain the variability in hydroxyurea MTD observed among patients with SCA.

This study determined gene expression signature associated with short-term oral prednisone therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its relationship to 1-year mortality following an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD).MethodsGene expression in whole blood was profiled using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST microarray chips from two cohorts: 1) a prednisone cohort with 37 stable COPD patients randomly assigned to prednisone 30â€‰mg/dâ€‰+â€‰standard therapy for 4â€‰days or standard therapy alone and 2) the Rapid Transition Program (RTP) cohort with 218 COPD patients who experienced AECOPD and were treated with systemic corticosteroids. All gene expression data were adjusted for the total number of white blood cells and their differential cell counts.ResultsIn the prednisone cohort, 51 genes were differentially expressed between prednisone and standard therapy group at a false discovery rate of <â€‰0.05. The top 3 genes with the largest fold-changes were KLRF1, GZMH and ADGRG1; and 21 genes were significantly enriched in immune system pathways including the natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity. In the RTP cohort, 27 patients (12.4%) died within 1â€‰year after hospitalisation of AECOPD; 32 of 51 genes differentially expressed in the prednisone cohort significantly changed from AECOPD to the convalescent state and were enriched in similar cellular immune pathways to that in the prednisone cohort. Of these, 10 genes including CX3CR1, KLRD1, S1PR5 and PRF1 were significantly associated with 1-year mortality.ConclusionsShort-term daily prednisone therapy produces a distinct blood gene signature that may be used to determine and monitor treatment responses to prednisone in COPD patients during AECOPD.Trial registrationThe prednisone cohort was registered at clinicalTrials.gov (NCT02534402) and the RTP cohort was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02050022).",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hiroto Takiguchi"", ids = ""4908897""); list(name = ""Virginia Chen"", ids = ""48207028""); list(name = ""Maâ\200\231en Obeidat"", ids = ""47825680""); list(name = ""Zsuzsanna Hollander"", ids = ""2404531""); list(name = ""J.

3fc79628531c2e0536e431d7f2bf995d8034a549,Integrated analysis of multiple high-dimensional data sets by joint rank-1 matrix approximations,"In this work, we developed an algorithm for the integrated analysis of multiple high-dimensional data matrices based on sparse rank-one matrix approximations. The algorithm approximates multiple data matrices with rank one outer products composed of sparse left singular-vectors that are unique to each matrix and a right singular-vector that is shared by all of the data matrices. The right-singular vector represents a signal we wish to detect in the row-space of each matrix. The non-zero components of the resulting left-singular vectors identify rows of each matrix that in aggregate provide a sparse linear representation of the shared right-singular vector. This sparse representation facilitates downstream interpretation and validation of the resulting model based on the rows selected from each matrix. False discovery rate is used to select an appropriate â„“1 penalty parameter that imposes sparsity on the left singular-vector but not the common right singular-vector of the joint approximation. Since a given multi-modal data set (MMDS) may contain multiple signals of interest the algorithm is iteratively applied to the residualized version of original data to sequentially capture and model each distinct signal in terms of rows from the different matrices. We show that the algorithm outperforms standard singular value decomposition over a wide range of simulation scenarios in terms of detection accuracy.

Aim: To describe the association between oral bacteria and lung function in a healthy population from Bergen, Norway. Methods: Samples of gingival fluid were collected concurrently with spirometry in 288 adults (52% males, median age 28 years) from the RHINESSA study, Bergen centre. Bacterial DNA from the 16S rRNA gene were isolated from gingival fluid, sequenced by IlluminaÂ® and assigned bacterial taxonomy by the Human Oral Microbiome Database. Differential abundance in the gingival microbiome by FEV1 and FVC percent predicted was evaluated by the Analysis of Composition of Microbiomes methodology with 5% False Discovery Rate, adjusting for weight, education, smoking and asthma medication. Results: We identified 148 bacteria genera in the gingival fluid samples. 12 genera, accounting for 4.5% of the total gingiva microbiota, showed increased relative abundance with lower FEV1. The main contributors were Rothia spp. (2.4%) and Enterococcus spp. (1.2%). Among the 12 genera associated with FEV1, 6 genera (0.8% of the gingiva bacterial community) were also associated with lower FVC, with Propionibacterium spp. (0.6%) as the main contributor. Additionally 6 genera were associated with lower FVC; these contributed to Conclusion: High levels of Rothia, Propionibacterium and Enterococcus genera were associated with lower lung function, FEV1 in particular. Rothia species are implicated in lung disease and with periodontitis, while Propionibacterium and Enterococcus include known cariogenic pathogens.

To identify genetic markers associated with treatment-induced thrombocytopenia, we whole-exome sequenced 215 non-small cell lung cancer patients homogeneously treated with gemcitabine/carboplatin. The decrease in platelets (defined as nadir/baseline) was used to assess treatment-induced thrombocytopenia. Association between germline genetic variants and thrombocytopenia was analyzed at single-nucleotide variant (SNV) (based on the optimal false discovery rate, the severity of predicted consequence, and effect), gene, and pathway levels. These analyses identified 130 SNVs/INDELs and 25 genes associated with thrombocytopenia (P-valueâ€‰<â€‰0.002). Twenty-three SNVs were validated in an independent genome-wide association study (GWAS). The top associations include rs34491125 in JMJD1C (P-valueâ€‰=â€‰9.07â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’5), the validated variants rs10491684 in DOCK8 (P-valueâ€‰=â€‰1.95â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’4), rs6118 in SERPINA5 (P-valueâ€‰=â€‰5.83â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’4), and rs5877 in SERPINC1 (P-valueâ€‰=â€‰1.07â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’3), and the genes CAPZA2 (P-valueâ€‰=â€‰4.03â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’4) and SERPINC1 (P-valueâ€‰=â€‰1.55â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’3). The SNVs in the top-scoring pathway â€œFactors involved in megakaryocyte development and platelet productionâ€ (P-valueâ€‰=â€‰3.34â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’4) were used to construct weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) and logistic regression models that predict thrombocytopenia.

2b18ea2fef6ebea296e7fe4998e7638a80e2b3f0,Association between promoter methylation of serotonin transporter gene and depressive symptoms: a monozygotic twin study.,"OBJECTIVE
Epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) is a key candidate gene for depression. We examined the association between SLC6A4 promoter methylation variation and depressive symptoms using 84 monozygotic twin pairs.


METHODS
DNA methylation level in the SLC6A4 promoter region was quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing using genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes. The number of current depressive symptoms was assessed using the Beck Depressive Inventory II (BDI-II). The association between methylation variation and depressive symptoms was examined using matched twin-pair analyses, adjusting for body mass index, smoking, physical activity, and alcohol consumption. Multiple testing was controlled by adjusted false discovery rate (q value).


RESULTS
Intrapair difference in DNA methylation variation at 10 of the 20 studied CpG sites is significantly correlated with intrapair difference in BDI scores. Linear regression using intrapair differences demonstrates that intrapair difference in BDI score was significantly associated with intrapair differences in DNA methylation variation after adjusting for potential confounders and correction for multiple testing. On average, a 10% increase in the difference in mean DNA methylation level was associated with 4.4 increase in the difference in BDI score (95% confidence interval = 0.9-7.9, p = .01).


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides evidence that variation in methylation level within the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene is associated with variation in depressive symptoms in a large sample of monozygotic twin pairs. This relationship is not confounded by genetic and shared environment. The 5-HTTLPR genotype also does not modulate this association.",2013,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Jinying Zhao"", ids = ""3306631""); list(name = ""Jack H.

4494a778aa2196a86a87e4b6704c58f26531c323,Identification of genetic risk associated with prostate cancer using ancestry informative markers,"Background:Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common malignancy and a leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States with African-American (AA) men having the highest incidence and mortality rates. Given recent results from admixture mapping and genome-wide association studies for PCa in AA men, it is clear that many risk alleles are enriched in men with West African genetic ancestry.Methods:A total of 77 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) within surrounding candidate gene regions were genotyped and haplotyped using Pyrosequencing in 358 unrelated men enrolled in a PCa genetic association study at the Howard University Hospital between 2000 and 2004. Sequence analysis of promoter region single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to evaluate disruption of transcription factor-binding sites was conducted using in silico methods.Results:Eight AIMs were significantly associated with PCa risk after adjusting for age and West African ancestry. SNP rs1993973 (intervening sequences) had the strongest association with PCa using the log-additive genetic model (P=0.002). SNPs rs1561131 (genotypic, P=0.007), rs1963562 (dominant, P=0.01) and rs615382 (recessive, P=0.009) remained highly significant after adjusting for both age and ancestry. We also tested the independent effect of each significantly associated SNP and rs1561131 (P=0.04) and rs1963562 (P=0.04) remained significantly associated with PCa development. After multiple comparisons testing using the false discovery rate, rs1993973 remained significant. Analysis of the rs156113â€“, rs1963562â€“rs615382l and rs1993973â€“rs585224 haplotypes revealed that the least frequently found haplotypes in this population were significantly associated with a decreased risk of PCa (P=0.032 and 0.0017, respectively).Conclusions:The approach for SNP selection utilized herein showed that AIMs may not only leverage increased linkage disequilibrium in populations to identify risk and protective alleles, but may also be informative in dissecting the biology of PCa and other health disparities.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Luisel J Ricks-Santi"", ids = ""1399532940""); list(name = ""Victor Apprey"", ids = ""5019145""); list(name = ""Terri Mason"", ids = ""40562373""); list(name = ""Bry Wilson"", ids = ""123880547""); list(name = ""Mosapour Abbas"", ids = ""79540350""); list(name = ""Wanda HernÃ¡ndez"", ids = ""35259982""); list(name = ""Stanley Hooker"", ids = ""47216129""); list(name = ""Meneham Doura"", ids = ""1397738996""); list(name = ""George Bonney"", ids = ""81068042""); list(name = ""Georgia Dunston"", ids = ""1388866984""); list(name = ""Rick A.

cd06233a5bd007d3e77a12f2d6f6678b52cf4e9b,Identification of FGF7 as a novel susceptibility locus for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"RATIONALE
Traditional genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of large cohorts of subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have successfully identified novel candidate genes, but several other plausible loci do not meet strict criteria for genome-wide significance after correction for multiple testing.


OBJECTIVES
The authors hypothesise that by applying unbiased weights derived from unique populations we can identify additional COPD susceptibility loci. Methods The authors performed a homozygosity haplotype analysis on a group of subjects with and without COPD to identify regions of conserved homozygosity haplotype (RCHHs). Weights were constructed based on the frequency of these RCHHs in case versus controls, and used to adjust the p values from a large collaborative GWAS of COPD.


RESULTS
The authors identified 2318 RCHHs, of which 576 were significantly (p<0.05) over-represented in cases. After applying the weights constructed from these regions to a collaborative GWAS of COPD, the authors identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a novel gene (fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF7)) that gained genome-wide significance by the false discovery rate method. In a follow-up analysis, both SNPs (rs12591300 and rs4480740) were significantly associated with COPD in an independent population (combined p values of 7.9E-7 and 2.8E-6, respectively). In another independent population, increased lung tissue FGF7 expression was associated with worse measures of lung function.


CONCLUSION
Weights constructed from a homozygosity haplotype analysis of an isolated population successfully identify novel genetic associations from a GWAS on a separate population. This method can be used to identify promising candidate genes that fail to meet strict correction for multiple testing.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""John M.

Factors of increased prevalence among individuals with Black racial identity (e.g., cardiovascular disease, CVD) may influence the association between exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI) from American football and later-life neurological outcomes. Here, we tested the interaction between racial identity and RHI on neurobehavioral outcomes, brain volumetric measures, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau181), and AÎ²1 - 42 in symptomatic former National Football League (NFL) players.


Methods
68 symptomatic male former NFL players (ages 40-69; n = 27 Black, n = 41 White) underwent neuropsychological testing, structural MRI, and lumbar puncture. FreeSurfer derived estimated intracranial volume (eICV), gray matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV), subcortical GMV, hippocampal volume, and white matter (WM) hypointensities. Multivariate generalized linear models examined the main effects of racial identity and its interaction with a cumulative head impact index (CHII) on all outcomes. Age, years of education, Wide Range Achievement Test, Fourth Edition (WRAT-4) scores, CVD risk factors, and APOEÎµ4 were included as covariates; eICV was included for MRI models. P-values were false discovery rate adjusted.


Results
Compared to White former NFL players, Black participants were 4 years younger (p = 0.04), had lower WRAT-4 scores (mean difference = 8.03, p = 0.002), and a higher BMI (mean difference = 3.09, p = 0.01) and systolic blood pressure (mean difference = 8.15, p = 0.03). With regards to group differences on the basis of racial identity, compared to White former NFL players, Black participants had lower GMV (mean adjusted difference = 45649.00, p = 0.001), lower right hippocampal volume (mean adjusted difference = 271.96, p = 0.02), and higher p-tau181/t-tau ratio (mean adjusted difference = -0.25, p = 0.01). There was not a statistically significant association between the CHII with GMV, right hippocampal volume, or p-tau181/t-tau ratio. However, there was a statistically significant Race x CHII interaction for GMV (b = 2206.29, p = 0.001), right hippocampal volume (b = 12.07, p = 0.04), and p-tau181/t-tau ratio concentrations (b = -0.01, p = 0.004).

Continued research on racial neurological disparities could provide insight into risk factors for long-term neurological disorders associated with American football play.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael Alosco"", ids = ""3763852""); list(name = ""Yorghos Tripodis"", ids = ""6740638""); list(name = ""Inga K Koerte"", ids = ""2994203""); list(name = ""Jonathan D.

cff8009aa27a5933df64a776ad2f476024926f55,Betel quid chewing alters functional connectivity in frontal and default networks: A restingâ€state fMRI study,"PURPOSE
To explore the acute effect of betel quid (BQ) use on functional network connectivity by comparing the global functional brain networks and their subsets before and immediately after BQ chewing.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed in 27 healthy male participants before and just after chewing BQ on a 3.0T scanner with a gradient-echo echo planar imaging sequence. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to determine components that represent the brain's functional networks and their spatial aspects of functional connectivity. A paired t-test was used for exploring the connectivity differences in each network before and after BQ chewing.


RESULTS
Sixteen networks were identified by ICA. Nine of them showed connectivity differences before and after BQ chewing (P < 0.05 false discovery rate corrected): (A) orbitofrontal, (B) left frontoparietal, (C) visual, (D) right frontoparietal, (E) anterior default mode, (F) medial frontal/anterior cingulate (G) frontotemporal, (H) occipital/parietal, (I) occipital/temporal/cerebellum. Moreover, networks A, B, C, D, G, H, and I showed increased connectivity, while networks E and F showed decreased connectivity in participants after BQ chewing compared to before chewing.


CONCLUSION
The acute effects of BQ use appear to actively alter functional connectivity of frontal and default networks that are known to play a key role in addictive behavior.

28fca009770e583f0a78a377b8f00b74d2bcda87,Comprehensive analysis of long non-coding RNAs expression pattern in the pathogenesis of pulmonary tuberculosis.,"BACKGROUND
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in the progression and pathogenesis of cancer. Right now, less is known about the association between the expression of lncRNAs and the pathogenesis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB).


METHODS
In present study, the expression profiles of lncRNAs were investigated by transcriptome sequencing from PTB patients vs. healthy individuals.


RESULTS
A total of 449 differentially expressed (DE) (fold change â‰¥2, false discovery rateâ€¯â‰¤â€¯0.05) lncRNAs were screened out from the PTB patients. Lnc-HNRNPU-1:7 and lnc-FAM76B-4:1 was found the most upregulated lncRNAs and downregulated lncRNAs in PTB patients, respectively. GO annotation and KEGG analysis were used to explore the potential roles of these DE lncRNAs. The JAK/STAT and TGF-Î² signaling pathways related to PTB pathogenesis were enriched in PTB patients. The co-expressed of a few lncRNAs and mRNAs on chromosome were shown by cis-regulatory gene analysis. Trans analysis indicated that STAT1, STAT2 and TAF7 transcription factors regulated the expression of lncRNA and mRNA. The constructed lncRNA ceRNA network suggested that lncRNAs regulating mRNAs expression may mediate by sponged miRNAs.


CONCLUSION
We comprehensively analyzed the expression profiles of lncRNAs in PTB patients, thus providing new clues for exploring the regulatory mechanisms of dysregulated lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of PTB.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xin-pu Zhang"", ids = ""14827290""); list(name = ""Zi Chang Liang"", ids = ""3426997""); list(name = ""Yunshan Zhang"", ids = ""46867192""); list(name = ""Kun Dai"", ids = ""153913159""); list(name = ""Mengying Zhu"", ids = ""49716407""); list(name = ""Ji Wang"", ids = ""97773541""); list(name = ""Xiaolong Hu"", ids = ""48539377"")",,,Genomics,,

Structural Abnormalities in the Cingulate Cortex in Adolescents at Ultra-high Risk Who Later Develop Psychosis,"s for the Sixth Biennial SIRS Conference Poster Session I S183 Jaap Janssen1, Grainne McAlonan3, Oswald Bloemen4, Therese van Amelsvoort1 1Maastricht University; 2Academic Medical Center; 3Institute of Psychiatry; 4GGz Centraal/Maastricht University Background: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is characterized by a microdeletion on the long arm of chromosome 22. The clinical phenotype of this syndrome is highly variable but symptoms include cognitive impairment, heart malformations, auto-immune problems and a high risk of developing a psychotic disorder. One of the genes located in the deleted region is PRODH which encodes proline dehydrogenase (PRODH). This enzyme is involved in converting proline to glutamate (GLU). GLU is involved in the pathophysiology of psychosis, particularly in cognitive symptoms (Lewis and Moghaddam 2006). Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is involved in cognition and psychosis as well (Vinkers et  al. 2010). With this study we aimed to investigate GLUergic and GABAergic reactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum in medication-free patients with 22q11DS with no psychiatric history and healthy controls (HC). Methods: This was a randomized double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study. Groups were matched for age and gender. 12 patients with 22q11DS (mean age 35 years) and 20 HCs (mean age 31 years) were enrolled in the study. GABA and GLU, levels in the ACC and striatum were obtained twice with 7Tesla Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS, STEAM): once after placebo and once after oral administration of 50 mg. riluzole (agent with anti-glutamate and pro-GABA action). Striatal and ACC GLU/GABA ratios were computed as well as GLUergic and GABAergic reactivity (placebo minus riluzole). In addition, within the 22q11DS group, the relationship between cognitive functions (memory and attention) measured with the CANTAB and GABA, GLU, GLU/GABA ratio, GABAergic reactivity and GLUergic in the ACC and striatum were examined. Results: Analyses of Covariance (ANCOVA) showed no baseline group differences in glutamate and GABA levels and GLU/GABA ratios (corrected for fraction of cerebral spinal fluid, CSF) in both brain regions. A repeated measures ANCOVA showed a trend level significant increase in striatal GABA concentrations after (p= 0.065). Riluzole had no significant effect on GLU (p= 0.303) and GLU/GABA ratios (p= 0.150) in the striatum. No medication X group interaction effects were found. Riluzole had no significant effect on GABA (p= 0.101), GLU (p= 0.847) and GLU/GABA ratio (p= 0.108) in the ACC. No group main effects and no medication X group interactions effects were found. However, a significant negative correlation was found between verbal memory (r= -0.650, p= 0.030) and ACC GLU levels, as well as GLUergic reactivity (r= -0.733, p= 0.010). Moreover, in the 22q11DS group, a significant negative correlation was found between attention (target sequence detection) and ACC GLU levels (r= -0.704, p= 0.016) as well as GLU/GABA ratio (r= -0.602, p= 0.050). Furthermore, sustained attention was positively associated with ACC GABA levels (r= 0.700, p= 0.024) and negatively associated with GLU/GABA ratio r= -0.639, p= 0.047) in these patients. Finally, a positive correlation was found between visual memory and striatal GLU levels (r= 0.616, p= 0.043). Discussion: The present study did not demonstrate differences in ACC and striatal GLU and GABA levels, nor in GLUergig or GABAergic reactivity in response to riluzole between 22q11DS patients and controls. However, these results suggest a role for GLU and GABA in cognition in the 22q11DS group. Therefore, influencing these neurotransmitter systems might enhance cognitive functioning in these patients. More studies are required to replicate these findings. T174.

Background: Identification of biomarkers of transition to psychosis in individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) has the potential to improve future outcomes (McGorry, 2008). Structural MRI studies with UHR samples have revealed steeper rates of cortical thinning in temporal, prefrontal and cingulate cortices in individuals who later develop psychosis in both baseline and longitudinal comparisons (Fusar-Poli, 2011; Cannon, 2014). However, little is known about how onset of prodromal symptoms during adolescence impacts on changes in cortical thickness (CTH) (Ziermans, 2012). Methods: Multicentre cross-sectional case-control study, including youth aged 10â€“17 years, recruited from two child and adolescent mental health centres. UHR individuals were identified using the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes criteria with some modifications. Healthy controls (HC) were recruited from the same geographical area. Exclusion criteria comprised personal history of psychotic symptoms, IQ<70, autism spectrum disorder, presence of neurological disorder, or antecedents of head trauma with loss of consciousness. The study was approved by the local Ethical Review Boards. All participants underwent a comprehensive socio-demographic and clinical evaluation at baseline and after 6, 12 and 18 months follow-up to identify which individuals converted to psychosis (UHR-P) and which did not (UHR-NP). High-resolution magnetic resonance structural images were acquired at baseline on a 3Tesla and 1.5Tesla scanners. An inter-site compatibility study was conducted with healthy controls which revealed high inter-site correlation coefficients (r>.6) for CTH measures. Images were pre-processed employing automated procedures implemented in FreeSurfer 5.3.0, cortical parcellation employed the Desikan-Killiany brain atlas. Analyses: First, mean global and lobar (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, insula and cingulate) CTH measurements were computed. Then, within lobes showing group effects, CTH was measured for each parcellation. ANCOVA was performed to test differences between groups in SPSS 22.0, including gender, age, total intracranial volume and site as covariates. Significance was set at p<.05, corrected using the false discovery rate (FDR). Results: 122 subjects were included (59 UHR-NP vs. 18 UHR-P vs. 45 HC, mean ages: 15.2 Â± 1.5 vs. 15.0 Â± 1.8 vs. 15.8 Â± 1.5, F=1.9, p=.15; gender (%female): 61.0% vs 61.1% vs 68.9%, Ï‡2=.76, p=.68). There were no significant differences in case-control proportion between centres: Ï‡2=1.3, p=.25. No significant differences in global CTH in UHR-P (2.57 Â± 0.13mm) relative to UHR-NP (2.56 Â± 0.11mm) and HC (2.58 Â± 0.09mm) were found. There was a significant group effect on the right cingulate cortex (F=6.6, pFDR=.024): UHR-P showed lower CTH in this area relative to controls (p=.007 uncorrected). Within the right cingulate cortex, a significant group effect was found in the posterior cingulate (F=5.7, pFDR=.016) and isthmus (F=4.6, pFDR=.024), and a trend level in the caudal anterior cingulate (F=2.9, p=.057): with smaller CTH in UHR-P relative to HC in the isthmus cingulate (p=.025) and the posterior cingulate (p=.066). No significant differences were observed between UHR-P and UHR-NP groups.",2018,Psychology,"list(name = ""Adriana Fortea"", ids = ""10399118""); list(name = ""Phillip van Eindhjoven"", ids = ""117017964""); list(name = ""JosÃ© Carlos Pariente"", ids = ""14402273""); list(name = ""Anna Calvo"", ids = ""153936084""); list(name = ""Albert Batalla"", ids = ""48449053""); list(name = ""Elena de la Serna"", ids = ""133885115""); list(name = ""Daniel Ilzarbe"", ids = ""7679288""); list(name = ""Jordina Tor"", ids = ""38875838""); list(name = ""Montserrat Dolz"", ids = ""144787933""); list(name = ""Inmaculada Baeza"", ids = ""52215665""); list(name = ""Gisela Sugranyes"", ids = ""6079746"")",,,Schizophrenia Bulletin,44,S183 - S184

Genetic variants in the Il-17 may influence the immunopathogenesis of many diseases. Many studies have investigated the relevance of IL-17 polymorphism with cancers or immune diseases, including asthma. In this study, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL-17 were explored by PCR-RFLP and verified by sequencing method. The frequencies of genotypes and alleles were analyzed. Haplotypes were analyzed with the SHEsis online program. The relationship between the genotypes of SNPs and IgE level was also investigated. The False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction was performed (P-adjustedâ€¯<â€¯0.05). The frequencies of A allele, GA and (GAâ€¯+â€¯AA) genotype of rs3748067 were significantly higher in asthma patients. As for rs763780, the C allele in patients was more frequent than healthy controls. In addition, we found C carriers (CTâ€¯+â€¯CC) were significantly higher in asthma patients. We further found that the haplotype CT for IL-17F (rs763780/rs2397084) was associated with an increased susceptibility of asthma, but this association did not survive after FDR correction. The level of serum total IgE in mutant group (GAâ€¯+â€¯AA) of rs3748067 was significantly higher than the wild genotype (GG) group and control group. These results suggested that IL-17 SNPs, but not haplotypes may be associated with the susceptibility of asthma in Chinese Han population from central China.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tao Liang"", ids = ""145110347""); list(name = ""Yi Xu"", ids = ""51118726""); list(name = ""Yang Zhang"", ids = ""145937157""); list(name = ""Peng Cai"", ids = ""143671078""); list(name = ""Li Hua Hu"", ids = ""153126455"")",1c3b5e8c2eedf19496ff880edfa66b9a43f278db,,Human immunology,79 10,"

14f0c50d24e8cad3bb0e8736a48e06c814cb66ce,Exploring white matter microstructure and olfaction dysfunction in early parkinson disease: diffusion MRI reveals new insight,"Olfaction dysfunction is considered as a robust marker of prodromal Parkinson disease (PD). Measurement of olfaction function as a screening test is unsatisfactory due to long lead time interval and low specificity for detection of PD. Use of imaging markers might yield more accurate predictive values and provide bases for combined use of imaging and clinical markers for early PD. Diffusion MRI connectometry was conducted on 85 de novo PD patients in and 36 healthy controls to find: first, white matter tracts with significant difference in quantitative anisotropy between PD groups with various degrees of olfaction dysfunction and second, second fibers with correlation with University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score in each group using a multiple regression analysis considering age, sex, GDS and MoCA score. Local connectomes were determined in seven of all the possible comparisons, correcting for false discovery rate (FDR). PD patients with anosmia and normal olfaction had the highest number of fibers with decreased connectivity in left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, bilateral fornix, bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), bilateral cingulum, bilateral corticospinal tract (CST) and body, genu and splenium of corpus callosum (CC) (FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.0013). In multiple regression analysis, connectivity in the body, genu and splenium of CC and bilateral fornix had significant negative correlation (FDR between 0.019 and 0.083), and bilateral cingulum and MCP had significant positive correlation (FDR between 0.022 and 0.092) with UPSIT score. White matter connectivity in healthy controls could not be predicted by UPSIT score using the same model. The results of this study provide compelling evidence that microstructural degenerative changes in these areas underlie the clinical phenotype of prodromal olfaction dysfunction in PD and that diffusion parameters of these areas might be able to serve as signature markers for early detection of PD.

5beb7428be0b0c1094c40b5d49c496341accd937,Genetic Association of TCF4 and AKT1 Gene Variants with the Age at Onset of Schizophrenia,"Background: Age at onset (AAO) is a known prognostic indicator for schizophrenia and is hypothesized to correlate with cognition and symptom severity. TCF4 and AKT1 are schizophrenia risk genes involved in cognitive functions. The current study examined the interactive effects of TCF4 and AKT1 variants with gender, family history of psychiatric disorders and ethnicity on the AAO of schizophrenia. Methods: This study consisted of 322 patients with schizophrenia meeting the DSM-IV criteria. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TCF4 (rs12966547, rs8766, rs2958182, rs9960767, rs10401120 and rs17512836) and seven AKT1 SNPs (rs2498804, rs3803304, rs2494732, rs3730358, rs1130214, rs2498784 and rs3803300) were genotyped using the TaqManÂ® SNP genotyping-based assays method. The relationship of AAO with each variant was investigated using analyses of covariance. Results: Among the TCF4 variants, rs12966547 (p = 0.024) and rs8766 (p = 0.021) were significantly associated with earlier AAO. We found a lower average AAO in patients with the AA genotype of rs12966547, while the CT genotype of rs8766 was demonstrated to have a protective effect on AAO. For rs8766, there was significant gene Ã— gender interaction (p = 0.012) in influencing AAO. However, these results were not significant after false discovery rate correction. Significant gene Ã— ethnicity interactions were observed to influence AAO (p < 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier curve of the minor AA genotype of rs12966547 displayed a significant trend (p = 0.008) for onset after 19 years of age. Similarly, the minor CC genotype of rs8766 showed a significantly (p = 0.034) lower AAO compared to the TT genotype. Conclusion: Our analyses suggest that individual risk genotypes may influence the risk of schizophrenia in an age-specific manner.",2016,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tze Jen Chow"", ids = ""8014010""); list(name = ""Shiau Foon Tee"", ids = ""4706723""); list(name = ""Hoi Sen Yong"", ids = ""6606453""); list(name = ""Pek Yee Tang"", ids = ""32082589"")",49167b78d10b869fa307201205a49857e14c63b5; 3a5bdf15d94426da67e0e5fc88335c816731e472; 68f4bedf20658ef9815af12eded12de12def21e4; 1d8f8aac4f42cefa542261de7826197da8404b57; af5604c0f845e07bd8a072e2af44139dd1a7cfab,cac47cafa0abc3169452f1b08621b9c412cc4f9d; 68f655b695d5192260f5917cd28f86725cab1d9b; 18e286c0c255570753714770ae3403250c6e9fa6; 9bb532c7d076e86888fe25b2ab0008e026f8e981; 1e3d2fd0696b82a692b36e98152554ff96125b38; 8295b1afaa2086579f04590cbd4f7d73238a64a1; 92c85cacb697482a3bf6b6ea6cf5c7b36d8d9df1; 181fe63543582f788385bc72773bc2ddf03578c5; 00aacabcc45a55dd46eaf98e53443c1fbbd42b7d; eda9bf4b0b903328af4d53e75a0b1f27b1cf6dbb; 7daede67b36ec9d265ebc73994656240c4e7e67a; a578a83cc2dac53d17441eb72822064aa62322c9; caeed54705b665223b701ad620f75fcbce126f80; 38fdbfd1f5df8247eb8ebbd2fdb1f9a958ad5630; 676d69c72b5a184fd668a96912f9c58a29d4a40a; fc5fa337500eabe01a183794b52e829c43714ac3; 9f5b9bd9b95d9bdd878f604446c48e64184af824; 66a9842f869855ddb288481cb0a10923d213293d; 894b05dea8a673e1fa25d2991c26f32ebff923a0; 0a949e5961c43a42ae270ff6517af0514097b00b; ce682a58c45571470b10a319185d37afb54c9a3b; ca3e8bca31f8cbfa7dce481d92d9ee429e2614b2; a7c3e3fda30aec943f34c4862ce7e51bf5e5a453; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 6c8a9dea0f39c0a88e9f9385afded5c35ae0fff5; 8dee6c65b90db42016a40884b570c968546e7061; 1a48f22dba0939684dd0d6ba1f4401714cc78740; 5fa2c0150204a2574d874b9e06d3c879f391295b; f06ae150d027d5f2510d72a3975ad33b2ed40f31; 805032d78a9e15ef2a68d294a27d4adedee4118c; d6df4a52e6fffadda2951d73dd51efb312b91e6f; 71433fbf99806fd137601e5a2b8f0c26cf27fcb9; b641f666f961db3e36f84c6adf0725973e640282; 5ff2bed5224700578a550138cf9d5ba48e090e62; 158be756494839d411b96498cc6f3f85b4a698f7; 36861253f441650ecfcc0f09d70b3df79c053503; 6f3cd758aef9cb3316cdbb40ab25c21fcdae6c7b; a2d956e0aca8c2b1c6d5ec9ed3a92860e0fd478f; 8c40586734bdfcb12ad027e38a2f419753843bba; 27a0ff2ddf95d57110dd34523c9c42d2525d8c94; 615a3cc267327bf3e5a47cca6c5b4bcb92b0f172; 0473be84284657516fe2da14bcc1ab05ddee48f4; 6cfa3c97cd610d0c08c5921449c4231b0f278b2a; fbc323db7fcc79cd45ce3dd8b4472af86e9f86b6; b91a36398ebe174f4044eb88debb2c26a335fd33; 666826de3193886ea7e1429880d3e028e8692856; 36c99de34026b4d855b2d97cb6c2045c8c126854; 5dc454b56fe30b0aaf53565a5224cd69879c6d58,Neuropsychobiology,73,233 - 240

Although the ANGPTL6 (angiopoietin-like 6) gene product is now known to be involved in the regulation of fat mass and insulin sensitivity in mice, its physiological functions in humans have yet to be determined.


METHODS
Subjects from the population-based French MONICA Study (n=3402) were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ANGPTL6, and associations with anthropometric or biochemical phenotypes were looked for.


RESULTS
On evaluating the frequency of 17 ANGPTL6 SNPs in 100 randomly selected subjects on the basis of linkage disequilibrium mapping, four SNPs (rs6511435, rs8112063, rs11671983 and rs15723) were found to cover more than 95% of the known ANGPTL6 genetic variability. Subjects from the entire MONICA Study were then genotyped for these four SNPs. No significant association was detected for rs11671983 and rs15723. In contrast, the G allele of rs8112063 was associated with lower plasma glucose levels (P=0.009). Also, obese subjects carrying the G allele of rs6511435 had higher plasma insulin levels than AA subjects (P=0.0055). Moreover, the G allele of rs6511435 tended to be associated with a 20% higher risk of the metabolic syndrome (P=0.034). However, when false discovery rate testing (40 tests) was applied, these associations were no longer statistically significant.


CONCLUSION
These findings constitute the first study in humans of ANGPTL6 genetic variability. Although there was no evidence that polymorphisms in ANGPTL6 might be significantly associated with the metabolic syndrome-related phenotypes, a weak association of these polymorphisms with these parameters cannot be excluded. Further association studies are needed to arrive at any definite conclusions.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Vanessa Legry"", ids = ""5085521""); list(name = ""Louisa Goumidi"", ids = ""4775274""); list(name = ""MarlÃ¨ne Huyvaert"", ids = ""4265915""); list(name = ""Dominique Cottel"", ids = ""5882253""); list(name = ""Jean FerriÃ¨res"", ids = ""2449850""); list(name = ""Dominique Arveiler"", ids = ""50407078""); list(name = ""Annie Bingham"", ids = ""2675001""); list(name = ""Aline Wagner"", ids = ""7010780""); list(name = ""J.

f4ea4c5dfba57732f1946a949f5d2a21bc8c51f1,Genetic variants in the SOX6 gene are associated with bone mineral density in both Caucasian and Chinese populations,"SummaryGiven the biological function of SOX6 and recent genome-wide association finding, we performed a fine-mapping association analyses to investigate the relationship between SOX6 and BMD both in Caucasian and Chinese populations. We identified many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within or near the SOX6 gene to be significantly associated with hip bone mineral density (BMD).IntroductionSOX6 gene is an essential transcription factor in chondrogenesis and cartilage formation. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) detected a SNP (rs7117858) located at the downstream of SOX6 significantly associated with hip BMD.MethodsGiven the biological function of SOX6 and the GWAS finding, we considered SOX6 as a new candidate for BMD and osteoporosis. Therefore, in this study, we performed a fine-mapping association analyses to investigate the relationship between SNPs within and near the SOX6 gene and BMD at both hip and spine. A total of 301 SNPs were tested in two independent US Caucasian populations (2,286 and 1,000 unrelated subjects, respectively) and a Chinese population (1,627 unrelated Han subjects).ResultsWe confirmed that the previously reported rs7117858-A was associated with reduced hip BMD, with combined P value of 2.45â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’4. Besides this SNP, we identified another 19 SNPs within or near the SOX6 gene to be significantly associated with hip BMD after false discovery rate adjustment. The most significant SNP was rs1347677 located at the intron 3 (Pâ€‰=â€‰3.15â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’7). Seven additional SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with rs1347677 were also significantly associated with hip BMD. SNPs in SOX6 showed significant skeletal site specificity since no SNP was detected to be associated with spine BMD.ConclusionOur study identified many SNPs in the SOX6 gene associated with hip BMD even across different ethnicities, which further highlighted the importance of the SOX6 gene influencing BMD variation and provided more information to the understanding of the genetic architecture of osteoporosis.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""T.-L.

4a109de3938692a354de3f29eb4eb6a09715c360,TEAM: efficient two-locus epistasis tests in human genome-wide association study,"As a promising tool for identifying genetic markers underlying phenotypic differences, genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been extensively investigated in recent years. In GWAS, detecting epistasis (or gene-gene interaction) is preferable over single locus study since many diseases are known to be complex traits. A brute force search is infeasible for epistasis detection in the genome-wide scale because of the intensive computational burden. Existing epistasis detection algorithms are designed for dataset consisting of homozygous markers and small sample size. In human study, however, the genotype may be heterozygous, and number of individuals can be up to thousands. Thus, existing methods are not readily applicable to human datasets. In this article, we propose an efficient algorithm, TEAM, which significantly speeds up epistasis detection for human GWAS. Our algorithm is exhaustive, i.e. it does not ignore any epistatic interaction. Utilizing the minimum spanning tree structure, the algorithm incrementally updates the contingency tables for epistatic tests without scanning all individuals. Our algorithm has broader applicability and is more efficient than existing methods for large sample study. It supports any statistical test that is based on contingency tables, and enables both family-wise error rate and false discovery rate controlling. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm only needs to examine a small portion of the individuals to update the contingency tables, and it achieves at least an order of magnitude speed up over the brute force approach.",2010,Computer Science;

2784fba6a6d6e4e19dd99e669b4781cae33b2271,miRNAs differentially expressed by next-generation sequencing in cord blood buffy coat samples of boys and girls.,"AIM
Differences in children's development and susceptibility to diseases and exposures have been observed by sex, yet human studies of sex differences in miRNAs are limited.


MATERIALS & METHODS
The genome-wide miRNA expression was characterized by sequencing-based EdgeSeq assay in cord blood buffy coats from 89 newborns, and 564 miRNAs were further analyzed.


RESULTS
Differential expression of most miRNAs was higher in boys. Neurodevelopment, RNA metabolism and metabolic ontology terms were enriched among miRNA targets. The majority of upregulated miRNAs (86%) validated by nCounter maintained positive-fold change values; however, only 21% reached statistical significance by false discovery rate.


CONCLUSION
Accounting for host factors like sex may improve the sensitivity of epigenetic analyses for epidemiological studies in early childhood.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daneida Lizarraga"", ids = ""50752341""); list(name = ""Karen Huen"", ids = ""3691568""); list(name = ""Mary A Combs"", ids = ""21093102""); list(name = ""Maria Escudero-Fung"", ids = ""1422532834""); list(name = ""Brenda Eskenazi"", ids = ""6929871""); list(name = ""Nina T.

We used nCounter miRNA Expression assay to measure miRNAs expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from patients with Bipolar Disorder (BD) who died by suicide (SC, nÂ =Â 7) and with low risk of suicide (LR, nÂ =Â 11). Five miRNAs were differentially expressed in SC compared to LR (false discovery rate p<0.05). The two most significant miRNAs were measured with RT-qPCR in the same sample and in 12 healthy controls (HC): miR-4286 was increased while miR-186-5p was decreased in SC compared to LR and HC (ANOVA FÂ =Â 14.92, pÂ =Â 0.000043 and FÂ =Â 3.95, pÂ =Â 0.032 respectively). miR-4286 was also decreased in postmortem brains from 12 patients with BD who died by suicide compared to 13 controls, even though it did not reach statistical significance (FC=0.51, pÂ =Â 0.07). Treatment with lithium of human neural progenitor cells reduced the expression of miR-4286 (FC=0.30, pÂ =Â 0.038). Pathway analysis on predicted miR-4286 targets showed that ""insulin resistance"" was significantly enriched after correction for multiple testing. This pathway comprised 17 genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism, several of which were also dysregulated in postmortem brains from patients with BD who died by suicide from the Stanley-foundation array collection. In conclusion, our study suggests that miR-4286 could be a biomarker of suicide but further studies are warranted to investigate its targeted genes and how these could be involved in the neurobiology of suicide.",2020,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alessio Squassina"", ids = ""2775742""); list(name = ""Paola Niola"", ids = ""36056520""); list(name = ""Juan Pablo Acosta L'opez"", ids = ""1834784""); list(name = ""Cristiana Cruceanu"", ids = ""48022207""); list(name = ""Maria Del Zompo"", ids = ""4701949"")",,,European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,,
6d23037cd8e07fa53e56fbf2bf9ae4b9896b2868,Annotating Transcriptional Effects of Genetic Variants in Diseaseâ€Relevant Tissue: Transcriptomeâ€Wide Allelic Imbalance in Osteoarthritic Cartilage,"OBJECTIVE
Multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) conferring susceptibility to osteoarthritis (OA) mark imbalanced expression of positional genes in articular cartilage, reflected by unequally expressed alleles among heterozygotes (allelic imbalance [AI]). We undertook this study to explore the articular cartilage transcriptome from OA patients for AI events to identify putative disease-driving genetic variation.


METHODS
AI was assessed in 42 preserved and 5 lesioned OA cartilage samples (from the Research Arthritis and Articular Cartilage study) for which RNA sequencing data were available. The count fraction of the alternative alleles among the alternative and reference alleles together (Ï†) was determined for heterozygous individuals. A meta-analysis was performed to generate a meta-Ï† and P value for each SNP with a false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons. To further validate AI events, we explored them as a function of multiple additional OA features.


RESULTS
We observed a total of 2,070 SNPs that consistently marked AI of 1,031 unique genes in articular cartilage. Of these genes, 49 were found to be significantly differentially expressed (fold change <0.5 or >2, FDR <0.05) between preserved and paired lesioned cartilage, and 18 had previously been reported to confer susceptibility to OA and/or related phenotypes. Moreover, we identified notable highly significant AI SNPs in the CRLF1, WWP2, and RPS3 genes that were related to multiple OA features.


CONCLUSION
We present a framework and resulting data set for researchers in the OA research field to probe for disease-relevant genetic variation that affects gene expression in pivotal disease-affected tissue. This likely includes putative novel compelling OA risk genes such as CRLF1, WWP2, and RPS3.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wouter J den Hollander"", ids = ""52181405""); list(name = ""Irina Pulyakhina"", ids = ""5164073""); list(name = ""Cindy G.

We compared individuals identifying as LGBQ+ or heterosexual on treatment outcomes following a partial hospital program based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). Method: A total of 441 participants (19% LGBQ+; mean age = 34.42 years; 56% female, 42% male, 2% nonbinary) attending a partial hospital program completed measures at admission and discharge as part of standard care. We compared LGBQ+ and heterosexual individuals on symptom outcomes (24-item Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire), program dropout due to inpatient hospitalization, clinical global improvement, and perceived quality of care, controlling for baseline characteristics using propensity score adjustment. Results: Controlling for baseline demographic and clinical variables and a 10% false discovery rate, LGBQ+ and heterosexual individuals did not differ on treatment outcomes. However, when examining sexual identity subgroups, bisexual individuals reported more self-injurious and suicidal thoughts and worse perceptions of care at posttreatment compared to all other sexual identities. Conclusions: Findings support the comparable effectiveness of CBT- and DBT-skills-based hospital treatment for LGBQ+ and heterosexual individuals overall but suggest specific treatment disparities for bisexual individuals. Future research is needed to establish the effectiveness of traditional evidence-based treatment in other settings and to determine whether LGBQ+ affirmative treatments for specific LGBQ+ subgroups are superior to traditional treatments.",2017,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Courtney Beard"", ids = ""40426756""); list(name = ""Norik Kirakosian"", ids = ""30033328""); list(name = ""Alexandra L Silverman"", ids = ""30128403""); list(name = ""Jeffrey P.

Recently, much attention has been paid to improve the solubilization of IMPs. However, besides that, the separation of hydrophobic peptides with high recovery is also a dominating factor, but with rare report. Here, the prefractionation of the digests by reverse phase trap column during desalting was presented to efficiently decrease the complexity of samples, with the identified hydrophobic peptides and IMPs increased by more than 43%. Furthermore, the effect of C18 and C8 stationary phases on the separation of membrane protein digests was studied. A total of 301 proteins (536 peptides) with C18 stationary phase and 398 proteins (703 peptides) with C8 stationary phase were identified by Î¼RPLC-ESI-MS/MS using an LCQ instrument in duplicate runs, with false discovery rate (FDR) less than 5% at peptide level. In addition, with C8 stationary phase, the number of identified hydrophobic peptides and IMPs was obviously improved by 29% and 20%, respectively, compared with that identified by C18 stationary phase, indicating that the polarity of stationary phase has evident effect on the analysis of membrane protein digests. All these results show that the prefractionation by reverse phase trap column during desalting and the separation by C8 stationary phases could facilitate the efficient identification of IMPs.",2012,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qun Zhao"", ids = ""144089821""); list(name = ""Liangliang Sun"", ids = ""2454822""); list(name = ""Yu Liang"", ids = ""143614054""); list(name = ""Qi Wu"", ids = ""34902783""); list(name = ""Huiming Yuan"", ids = ""6631309""); list(name = ""Zhen Liang"", ids = ""47415873""); list(name = ""Lihua Zhang"", ids = ""1930287""); list(name = ""Yukui Zhang"", ids = ""13584666"")",c807dbcce0cb2d1aba07327533b60f30f72d3dc6; 7cf80ef1f957ae17dc00aeff88a8c1d588c0503e; 320e104f8f4a963d2b91e713c9437a2fa4576051,,Talanta,88,"

424b2025b677c5bc66970554853b42f291264cd1,Gene Expression Profiling in Pediatric Heart Transplant Rejection,"Purpose Gene expression profiling (GEP) has demonstrated utility in identifying heart transplant (HTx) patients at increased risk for acute rejection (AR) in adult populations. GEP has not been well studied in pediatric HTx patients whose immune system function may differ from adults. Improved understanding of alterations in gene expression between AR and quiescence may be beneficial in pediatric HTx recipients. Methods and Materials Blood samples were prospectively collected from pediatric HTx recipients (aged 1-18 years) who had undergone transplant at least six months prior to enrollment. Samples were collected over one year, at six month intervals and at time of AR. Acute rejection was defined as clinically indicated augmentation of immunosuppression which in some patients was accompanied by abnormal echocardiogram or biopsy. GEP of 84 genes in the inflammatory cascade (chemokines, cytokines and their receptors) was performed on peripheral mononuclear lymphocytes by commercially available PCR (Illumina Biosciences) array. Expression profiles were analyzed with the commonly used Significant Analysis of Microarray (SAM). Comparison was within individual at time of AR and quiescence. The genes that differentially expressed with and without AR were identified by controlling the false discovery rates at 5%. Results Gene expression profiling was conducted on 17 blood samples (AR and quiescent) from five subjects. A total of 47331 transcripts from the 84 genes were analyzed. Expression levels of defensin family of genes were significantly higher at the time of at AR than at the time of quiescence. This pattern was consistent in 3 of 5 subjects. Conclusions Gene expression profiling holds promise in identifying specific regulatory pathways or gene families with differential activity at times of AR in pediatric HTx recipients. The gene family identified in this study is different from those identified in adult HTx recipients. Further study could lead to improved ability to modulate immunosuppression and/or predict impending AR.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kenneth Knecht"", ids = ""3416794""); list(name = ""S. L.

2d755f44915a4757fb465621ed89bc3a69deb81b,Methods for Automated Identification of Informative Behaviors in Natural Bioptic Driving,"Visually impaired people may legally drive if wearing bioptic telescopes in some developed countries. To address the controversial safety issue of the practice, we have developed a low-cost in-car recording system that can be installed in study participants' own vehicles to record their daily driving activities. We also developed a set of automated identification techniques of informative behaviors to facilitate efficient manual review of important segments submerged in the vast amount of uncontrolled data. Here, we present the methods and quantitative results of the detection performance for six types of driving maneuvers and behaviors that are important for bioptic driving: bioptic telescope use, turns, curves, intersections, weaving, and rapid stops. The testing data were collected from one normally sighted and two visually impaired subjects across multiple days. The detection rates ranged from 82% up to 100%, and the false discovery rates ranged from 0% to 13%. In addition, two human observers were able to interpret about 80% of targets viewed through the telescope. These results indicate that with appropriate data processing the low-cost system is able to provide reliable data for natural bioptic driving studies.",2012,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gang Luo"", ids = ""144050855""); list(name = ""Eli Peli"", ids = ""1802088"")",8d82a6cc29ee6165b6eef2493f3b6b8f2f759600; 6b13e72d57890b4dfee97a5c28a71bf95520f668; 9ba13430220b37ef29e2bea09aee7d70d4bb188d; 2a8acc158c383c9164f79fbf7f1c4cf25c928f49; 634ebda9ad62245d4f838bb648e4b383c74bff2e,5e0748c97e4ebfc5e6be8931eeb167dae78631b1; a31f02185c7ff94b80d6707b591ecd0aad41d399; fc69fe361376acaa8c229ee00adb78f96723aedb; ef1132bd70139f0655fbb14fdaffb5d6db4f022a; 1138eb5eb32ec53d1e5be74d71276dda7a5915f8; 0024aa33b7db2e0054ce106a7b9a2676d463a886; 6399542d98524d701a111854bb594172cbc001bb; de1e29c5cd9e52d13ae274ee180932d36d414741; b61e52d697cb45c2e58fe49fa989c8030b10a5e9; 65c248fb50109355c7f10f13d2725f943a5d4ac1; 8223b2c6c256697ae2684f1dd936bee9efa827aa; facd80a5e91901cd9cf05aab56ca0b84bdc9b30c; 336c981777d19af9a6e35db24fc7079b632016b8; 4d9d91b3659ea2006a20fee2a090694a551e88ed; 68463fc0ff7dd7a69689278c36d73dc9f9ed384c; a9487f8234b84bfde20182ea7871259138b246e9; 15c45915bc64cdbcae4fba51c8b03437d5143325; a2f72e2de2d1143ea560b23292c96f5308c4c29c; f1c34fd03d353fbfc2698076eb00b248223c43f8; 825dbd78b85cdefb1a83fb7e07b4bee6c1e6964b; b7e4df8142220c09ec1b4b32a8866f0f788b4254; 85a9dca91b47a350f9da3ba7c12859f520cc9933; 2a19ab233d60739b25c903df7bf626ec5b9ff39f; ebd373c64ee4ab1c3ffae6d13a6768e77d0dee5d,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,59,1780-1786

f84661452669480190bec13b15f45d11257ae2c7,Improving X!Tandem on Peptide Identification from Mass Spectrometry by Self-Boosted Percolator,"A critical component in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is an accurate protein identification procedure. Database search algorithms commonly generate a list of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). The validity of these PSMs is critical for downstream analysis since proteins that are present in the sample are inferred from those PSMs. A variety of postprocessing algorithms have been proposed to validate and filter PSMs. Among them, the most popular ones include a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach known as Percolator and an empirical modeling approach known as PeptideProphet. However, they are predominantly designed for commercial database search algorithms, i.e., SEQUEST and MASCOT. Therefore, it is highly desirable to extend and optimize those PSM postprocessing algorithms for open source database search algorithms such as X!Tandem. In this paper, we propose a Self-boosted Percolator for postprocessing X!Tandem search results. We find that the SSL algorithm utilized by Percolator depends heavily on the initial ranking of PSMs. Starting with a poor PSM ranking list may cause Percolator to perform suboptimally. By implementing Percolator in a cascade learning manner, we can progressively improve the performance through multiple boost runs, enabling many more PSM identifications without sacrificing false discovery rate (FDR).",2012,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Pengyi Yang"", ids = ""1745108""); list(name = ""Jie Ma"", ids = ""46282567""); list(name = ""Penghao Wang"", ids = ""40268133""); list(name = ""Yunping Zhu"", ids = ""35884237""); list(name = ""Bing Bing Zhou"", ids = ""1776472""); list(name = ""Jean Yee Hwa Yang"", ids = ""7788686"")",b9f956cb2e3395c180d9a90f507c535fe8dcc655; 3391d27f0604d33ebbff85a78f910b8a2b29bf69; 6c9bf16edc63e0d0a0c794243e4af9de0fa9db3a; d304cae8272d0c61e397ad4fdb21c91b1d113fa8; 23878c6714621b27e0f65d1eaff69f3e68cff06b; ef24df7a84eaf91d2adeee32f825d44fcb60a1c9; 7fa42b7631f2d2718f4042df93833dffffbb3962; 60ca8ab10dcf08fb1f674411c31d4740a62b5bc0; de3ec55bb6525a869b022e0763a355d26001e25f; 5cda49a32a4cea2dc3a27d81c212a8ce4d2b16ac; 5df40118b6a5253d4a56c7f397e81ecd1c0e2ce7,f09d4a533a221b9b85c591ba1dc862dd2fe808a1; 626f20664b982faa458e34f8df4ba072afcf2834; ad7e432b2d47e8755923c9297104793dd5781bee; 87b443f1141878a823dd6ee3e01df67d88c6d6a8; 42cec4727585098e6cb02b8ebf5979183fc3bf41; 2ed64ddd3338a40680f0eebfd2340a98575116e1; 10374f736a7d745f02cfbb56581a62913c38e874; 5d4176bc98c14cfa00ed546e26312884281e9c4a; 1eb7cb80b5ab5f7cb66a24e07ccfa14dfa61a633; 0d7ee3f200a044b594606c9067bbcd1638ec32e3; dbf1b4409476136941a1f2ac63710a957d2a6406; 7963b190e002371c807d5202d6b645beb9482c98; 6088ae4794d3ac35d3576ede803b9212662ba8bb; 1b03414ebace3aae831362dc3ab07619e1ecb36f; 216a4107a4b1d0689f6fcffcb15221bbacb7e198; c9e718ecccc94d8445edf904acd8e5edf258d0e4; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 8c1a1e761b715b23668b4f850e2bcc958fa21ad2; 89dcddec20bf68c609eaa843065c727a22dadaae; 0f5751f76cef4a502b22ad088c381a4d0bb10121; bb44ad12fb4b1f94e8988aa5dca0fe5f3d612c3a; 02089a851b318d02667e41e70ce0c0e65f2d91d1; 2bbf2ab3a524399c0daff3bc938d466f05501ae0; 7117adae60d6594822b5561892eb4888647cefce,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,9,1273-1280
db058714aebc7268d7e318ad1e189d19b444727e,Confounder Adjustment in Multiple Hypothesis Testing.,"We consider large-scale studies in which thousands of significance tests are performed simultaneously. In some of these studies, the multiple testing procedure can be severely biased by latent confounding factors such as batch effects and unmeasured covariates that correlate with both primary variable(s) of interest (e.g., treatment variable, phenotype) and the outcome. Over the past decade, many statistical methods have been proposed to adjust for the confounders in hypothesis testing. We unify these methods in the same framework, generalize them to include multiple primary variables and multiple nuisance variables, and analyze their statistical properties. In particular, we provide theoretical guarantees for RUV-4 [Gagnon-Bartsch, Jacob and Speed (2013)] and LEAPP [Ann. Appl. Stat. 6 (2012) 1664-1688], which correspond to two different identification conditions in the framework: the first requires a set of ""negative controls"" that are known a priori to follow the null distribution; the second requires the true nonnulls to be sparse. Two different estimators which are based on RUV-4 and LEAPP are then applied to these two scenarios. We show that if the confounding factors are strong, the resulting estimators can be asymptotically as powerful as the oracle estimator which observes the latent confounding factors. For hypothesis testing, we show the asymptotic z-tests based on the estimators can control the type I error. Numerical experiments show that the false discovery rate is also controlled by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure when the sample size is reasonably large.",2017,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jingshu Wang"", ids = ""49606825""); list(name = ""Qingyuan Zhao"", ids = ""49033211""); list(name = ""Trevor J.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the serum proteins biomarkers in the Chinese patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). In the study period, sera from 40 AIS patients and 40 normal cases were selected for screening study. Immunoaffinity subtraction was used to deplete the top most abundant serum proteins; the remaining serum proteins were subjected to trypsin digestion and analyzed in triplicate by label-free LC-MS/MS. The selected protein associations with disease risk were further evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing of the remaining stroke cases and controls. Its value for biomarkers diagnosis was appreciated through receiver operating curve (ROC). Patients versus control levels differences were suggested for 19 proteins (nominal Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) for stroke, with three proteins having a false discovery rate <0.05. The association of Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP-1) with stroke (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) was confirmed using ELISA in replication studies. Based on the ROC curve, the optimal cut-off value of serum SHIP-1 levels for diagnosis of stroke was projected to be 1,550Â pg/ml, which yielded a sensitivity of 77.5Â % and a specificity of 88.3Â %. In multivariate analysis, there was an increased risk of AIS associated with SHIP-1 levels â‰¥1,550Â pg/ml (OR 4.28, 95Â % CI: 1.97â€“8.96) after adjusting for possible confounders.

0a34081265123f536e43febd3c57ba5c25dd334b,False Discovery Rate and Asymptotics,"The false discovery rate (FDR) is a rather young error control criterion in multiple testing problems. Initiated by the pioneering paper by Benjamini and Hochberg from 1995, it has become popular in the 1990ies as an alternative to the strong control of the family-wise error rate, especially if a large system of hypotheses is at hand and the analysis has mainly explorative character. Instead of controlling the probability of one or more false rejections, the FDR controls the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses among all rejections. One typical application with strong impact on the development of the FDR is the first step (screening phase) of a microarray experiment where the experimenter aims at detecting a few candidate genes or SNPs potentially associated with a disease, which are than further analyzed using more stringent error handling methods. Especially due to such nowadays' applications with families of ten thousands or even some hundred thousands of hypotheses at hand, asymptotic considerations (with the number of hypotheses to be tested simultaneously tending to infinity) become more and more relevant. In this work, the behavior of the FDR is mainly studied from a theoretical point of view. After some fundamental issues as a preparation in Chapter 1, focus is laid in Chapter 2 on the asymptotic behaviour of the linear step-up procedure originally introduced by Benjamini and Hochberg. Since it is well known that this procedure strongly controls the FDR under positive dependency, we investigate the asymptotic conservativeness of this procedure under various distributional settings in depth. The results imply that, depending on the strength of positive dependence among the test statistics and the proportion of true nulls, the FDR can be close to the pre-specified error level or can be very small. Typically, the latter case leads to low power of the linear step-up procedure which raises the possibility for improvements of the algorithm. One improvement of Benjamini and Hochberg's procedure is presented and discussed in Chapter 3. Instead of using critical values increasing linearly (or, in other words, a linear rejection curve), we derive a non-linear and in some sense asymptotically optimal rejection curve leading to the full exhaustion of the FDR level under some extreme parameter configurations. This curve is then implemented into some stepwise multiple test procedures which control the FDR asymptotically or (with slight modifications) for a finite number of hypotheses. For the proof of FDR control for procedures employing non-linear critical values, some new methodology of proof is worked out. Chapter 4 then compares the newly derived methods with the original linear step-up procedure and other improved procedures with respect to multiple power. The results in this comparisons section are based on computer simulations. It turns out that certain procedures perform better in certain distributional setups or in other words that one can choose the appropriate FDR controlling algorithm to serve the purpose of detecting the most relevant alternatives most properly. Besides all these theoretical and methodological topics, we are also concerned with some practical aspects of FDR. We apply FDR controlling procedures to real life data and illustrate the functionality, assets and drawbacks of the different methods using these data sets.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Thorsten-Ingo M.

Molecular profiling studies have defined the increasing importance of gene expression phenotyping in breast cancer. However, the relationship between global transcriptomic profiles and the information provided by breast MRI remains to be examined. In this pilot study, our aim was to provide a preliminary radiogenomic association map linking MR image phenotypes to underlying global gene expression patterns in breast cancer.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
From a multiinstitutional study, a total of 353 patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer were examined for gene expression analysis. Radiogenomic analysis was then performed on a subset of these patients (n = 10) who also underwent breast MRI. Two radiologists evaluated each MRI study across 26 predefined imaging phenotypes. Analyses were performed to correlate the expression and imaging data and to define associations between specific MR image phenotypes and gene sets of interest.


RESULTS
High-level analysis revealed 21 imaging traits that were globally correlated (p < 0.05), with 71% of the total genes measured in patients with breast cancer. A significant correlation was identified between heterogeneous enhancement patterns and a previously described interferon breast cancer subtype (p < 0.01). We also identified 12 imaging traits that significantly correlated (false discovery rate < 0.25) with gene sets related to breast cancer and 11 traits correlated (false discovery rate < 0.25) to prognostic gene sets (van't Veer, wound response, and hypoxia metagene signatures) using gene enrichment analysis.


CONCLUSION
Radiogenomic analysis of breast cancer with MRI is a novel approach to understanding the underlying molecular biology of breast cancers.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shota Yamamoto"", ids = ""26793411""); list(name = ""Daniel D.

cfb2cfd43480d714b7d64aa453cb1aef8db445f0,Analysis of the RPE transcriptome reveals dynamic changes during the development of the outer blood-retinal barrier.,"PURPOSE
The morphology of the RPE shows minimal change as the neural retina and choriocapillaris differentiate. Nonetheless, initial studies of proteins related to the outer blood-retinal barrier suggest extensive remodeling of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in response to this changing environment. A genomic approach was used to investigate the extent of this remodeling.


METHODS
RPE was isolated from E7, E10, E14, and E18 chick embryos and total RNA extracted for probing the entire genome on Affymetrix microarray chips. Statistical parameters using ANOVA were adjusted to yield a theoretical false discovery rate of 5%. STEM software was used to cluster genes into statistically related patterns of expression. Gene ontology clustering, using Affymetrix software was used for functional clustering. The proteinlounge.com database was used as a source of known biological pathways.


RESULTS
Of the 37,694 probesets on the microarray, 17,199 were absent. Of the 20,495 expressed probes, the expression of 8,889 was developmentally regulated. 4,814 of these could be clustered into 12 patterns of expression that were statistically significant. Minimal contamination by surrounding tissues was detected. The developmental patterns of 22 tight and adherens junction proteins were compared using hybridization to the microarray and quantitative PCR. Only two showed small variations from the patterns revealed by the microarray. The data indicate extensive remodeling of the extracellular matrix, cell surface receptors, cell-cell junctions, transcellular ion transport, and signal transduction pathways throughout development. Notably, the appearance of the mRNAs for claudin 20, ZO-3, and cadherins 13 and 20 very late in development suggest barrier properties continue to change after functional junctions are formed.


CONCLUSIONS
The data reveal a far more dynamic view of the RPE and its interactions with its environment than would be expected from morphological examination.

8996108cde1c2c15790da057d261f8cddb1e77c0,Small effect size leads to reproducibility failure in resting-state fMRI studies,"Thousands of papers using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) have been published on brain disorders. Results in each paper may have survived correction for multiple comparison. However, since there have been no robust results from large scale meta-analysis, we do not know how many of published results are truly positives. The present meta-analytic work included 60 original studies, with 57 studies (4 datasets, 2266 participants) that used a between-group design and 3 studies (1 dataset, 107 participants) that employed a within-group design. To evaluate the effect size of brain disorders, a very large neuroimaging dataset ranging from neurological to psychiatric isorders together with healthy individuals have been analyzed. Parkinsonâ€™s disease off levodopa (PD-off) included 687 participants from 15 studies. PD on levodopa (PD-on) included 261 participants from 9 studies. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) included 958 participants from 27 studies. The meta-analyses of a metric named amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) showed that the effect size (Hedgesâ€™ g) was 0.19 - 0.39 for the 4 datasets using between-group design and 0.46 for the dataset using within-group design. The effect size of PD-off, PD-on and ASD were 0.23, 0.39, and 0.19, respectively. Using the meta-analysis results as the robust results, the between-group design results of each study showed high false negative rates (median 99%), high false discovery rates (median 86%), and low accuracy (median 1%), regardless of whether stringent or liberal multiple comparison correction was used. The findings were similar for 4 RS-fMRI metrics including ALFF, regional homogeneity, and degree centrality, as well as for another widely used RS-fMRI metric namely seed-based functional connectivity. These observations suggest that multiple comparison correction does not control for false discoveries across multiple studies when the effect sizes are relatively small. Meta-analysis on un-thresholded t-maps is critical for the recovery of ground truth. We recommend that to achieve high reproducibility through meta-analysis, the neuroimaging research field should share raw data or, at minimum, provide un-thresholded statistical images.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Xi-Ze Jia"", ids = ""51250475""); list(name = ""Na Zhao"", ids = ""143860909""); list(name = ""Barek Barton"", ids = ""89962452""); list(name = ""Roxana G Burciu"", ids = ""6732474""); list(name = ""Nicolas CarriÃ¨re"", ids = ""4949810""); list(name = ""Antonio Cerasa"", ids = ""1685733""); list(name = ""Bo-Yu Chen"", ids = ""5257373""); list(name = ""Jun Chen"", ids = ""81677355""); list(name = ""Stephen A.

Surveillance of medication use in pregnancy is essential to identify associations between first trimester medications and congenital anomalies (CAs). Medications in the same Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classes may have similar effects. We aimed to use this information to improve the detection of potential teratogens in CA surveillance data.


METHODS
Data on 15â€‰058 malformed fetuses with first trimester medication exposures from 1995-2011 were available from EUROmediCAT, a network of European CA registries. For each medication-CA combination, the proportion of the CA in fetuses with the medication was compared to the proportion of the CA in all other fetuses in the dataset. The Australian classification system was used to identify high-risk medications in order to compare two methods of controlling the false discovery rate (FDR): a single FDR applied across all combinations, and a double FDR incorporating groupings of medications.


RESULTS
There were 28â€‰765 potential combinations (523 medications Ã— 55 CAs) for analysis. An FDR cut-off of 50% resulted in a reasonable effective workload, for which single FDR gave rise to eight medication signals (three high-risk medications) and double FDR 50% identified 16 signals (six high-risk). Over a range of FDR cut-offs, double FDR identified more high-risk medications as signals, for comparable effective workloads.


CONCLUSIONS
The double FDR method appears to improve the detection of potential teratogens in comparison to the single FDR, while maintaining a low risk of false positives. Use of double FDR is recommended in routine signal detection analyses of CA data.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alana Cavadino"", ids = ""5558746""); list(name = ""David Prieto-Merino"", ids = ""1398142112""); list(name = ""Joan K Morris"", ids = ""31869674"")",76b9eef0c50e3ff00ca77c3d0b304532f954dd0b,,British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology,85,356â€“365
294cc1af20726164c105f828bd69f22d551418a1,Ultrawideband microwave breast cancer detection: a detection-theoretic approach using the generalized likelihood ratio test,"Microwave imaging has been suggested as a promising modality for early-stage breast cancer detection. In this paper, we propose a statistical microwave imaging technique wherein a set of generalized likelihood ratio tests (GLRT) is applied to microwave backscatter data to determine the presence and location of strong scatterers such as malignant tumors in the breast. The GLRT is formulated assuming that the backscatter data is Gaussian distributed with known covariance matrix. We describe the method for estimating this covariance matrix offline and formulating a GLRT for several heterogeneous two-dimensional (2-D) numerical breast phantoms, several three-dimensional (3-D) experimental breast phantoms, and a 3-D numerical breast phantom with a realistic half-ellipsoid shape. Using the GLRT with the estimated covariance matrix and a threshold chosen to constrain the false discovery rate (FDR) of the image, we show the capability to detect and localize small (<0.6 cm) tumors in our numerical and experimental breast phantoms even when the dielectric contrast of the malignant-to-normal tissue is below 2:1.",2005,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shakti K.

2af367e6a0af04739fa541c74b5c725a4206d846,Short communication: Genetic variation of riboflavin content in bovine milk.,"Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is an essential water-soluble vitamin; elderly people and adolescents in particular can have poor riboflavin status. In Western diets, milk and dairy products are primary sources of riboflavin, but little is known about the natural variation within and among bovine breeds, and how genetic and environmental factors can affect the riboflavin content in milk. As a part of the Danish-Swedish Milk Genomics Initiative, the aim of the study was to quantify milk riboflavin content using reverse-phase HPLC in 2 major Danish dairy breeds. The results showed substantial interbreed differences in milk riboflavin content. Milk from Danish Jersey cows contained significantly higher levels of riboflavin (1.93mg/L of milk) than milk from Danish Holstein cows (1.40mg/L of milk). Furthermore, genetic analyses revealed high heritabilities in both breeds (0.52 for Danish Holstein and 0.31 for Danish Jersey). A genomic association study found 35 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (false discovery rate<0.10) to be associated with riboflavin content in milk in Jersey cows (all on BTA14 and BTA17), and 511 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms in Holstein cows spread over 25 different autosomes with BTA13 and BTA14 having the most promising quantitative trait loci. The best candidate gene found within the identified quantitative trait loci was SLC52A3, a riboflavin transporter gene, which was among the significant markers on BTA13 in Holstein cows.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nina Aagaard Poulsen"", ids = ""4406320""); list(name = ""Iga Rybicka"", ids = ""49220419""); list(name = ""Lotte Bach Larsen"", ids = ""1830423""); list(name = ""Albert Johannes Buitenhuis"", ids = ""4244949""); list(name = ""Mette Krogh Larsen"", ids = ""2591022"")",fef7e24e16d97c6da4712d27adfc3e777ab2ac29; d9d4103fbcba2cb2ece10b6869c68693f66cc2d8; 46d7f2c701afda0b8951481474e9264121ff13e5,,Journal of dairy science,98 5,"

12f8227c77be1f7f370d1ac8fe56122296624d34,"Statistical tests for the intersection of independent lists of genes: Sensitivity, FDR, and type I error control","Public data repositories have enabled researchers to compare results across multiple genomic studies in order to replicate findings. A common approach is to first rank genes according to an hypothesis of interest within each study. Then, lists of the top-ranked genes within each study are compared across studies. Genes recaptured as highly ranked (usually above some threshold) in multiple studies are considered to be significant. However, this comparison strategy often remains informal, in that type I error and false discovery rate (FDR) are usually uncontrolled. In this paper, we formalize an inferential strategy for this kind of list-intersection discovery test. We show how to compute a $p$-value associated with a ""recaptured"" set of genes, using a closed-form Poisson approximation to the distribution of the size of the recaptured set. We investigate operating characteristics of the test as a function of the total number of studies considered, the rank threshold within each study, and the number of studies within which a gene must be recaptured to be declared significant. We investigate the trade off between FDR control and expected sensitivity (the expected proportion of true-positive genes identified as significant). We give practical guidance on how to design a bioinformatic list-intersection study with maximal expected sensitivity and prespecified control of type I error (at the set level) and false discovery rate (at the gene level). We show how optimal choice of parameters may depend on particular alternative hypothesis which might hold. We illustrate our methods using prostate cancer gene-expression datasets from the curated Oncomine database, and discuss the effects of dependence between genes on the test.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Loki Natarajan"", ids = ""46513982""); list(name = ""Minya Pu"", ids = ""145813335""); list(name = ""Karen Messer"", ids = ""144824982"")",217aba004977480711b1c181861e3924398296e9; 48b9b51a6f12109301bee379a5b21df794e5534a; fde12e0b207bcd0ee820f4645d63132458bafdbd; aa588f5072ab259347486e0666350980500721a8; 12f8227c77be1f7f370d1ac8fe56122296624d34,f2a3e940d704c95d89b6a7bbaf38e895a5c2f2f6; 34e87de7fdbab616e22b328b99b29a1ee50d4bc0; dde6feab9c351a7ce32e865b5ecd812a61b8fdcc; 70a06df9f6a3c86b4960d433abc2a16a8e7f1923; 2c9360d688c3ec444993d00b700b6e16dbcd5b1a; a7c994924da56f64ad405d03933f156c30d2d228; 3e24ff6f5f8eba407effc09a3e23ee583d4ee0e7; 2249ea630e56e4991aa157ad9aea65262efe4562; 08a1d9cdea3a2571f381b637f52df0a8209eaedb; 8f31f1026b8e752b131f376e4b68d44775edddc0; 239520c6578c9314e9fea4a36c0a98cb21a50fb3; 72c79d3ed6b39595198eb3b85a8de2ac01fe5612; 7107d41150d80e47451cf1d8084742b57a19295a; ca503434fe941b371a2860ff3b5286e9e4dbbf1c; 4871374a6fec685edcb6a5d7947554237f598210; 37d9ebd28e50c6b746dd30d59284f8447957f8a7; 12f8227c77be1f7f370d1ac8fe56122296624d34; 3c1b17742f9cec79614b053b19bafceb4fc566cc; ee98c051d3dc3721a5e09f2da6aaa3ec6450ebf0; c0d361344070a3d739f8d67e418f34805cd557b7; 36e2ee77159b7bfa360a789d49441c550827c3f2; 5075cd2006b94c25766accc5594a9ecd55049382; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98; 42cfbc87f5b1bcf6eda42a8c4d982a4c1dc32990; 0af9abdafc0b287e0e03c3af06d48d0da17522ef,arXiv: Applications,,
5dfa6b1e15af2e702a7483bb667a214b1c347720,PROCEDURES CONTROLLING THE k-FDR USING BIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE NULL p-VALUES,"Procedures controlling error rates measuring at least k false rejections, instead of at least one, are often desired while testing a large number of hypotheses. The k-FWER, probability of at least k false rejections, is such an error rate that has been introduced, and procedures controlling it have been proposed. Recently, Sarkar (2007) introduced an alternative, less conservative notion of error rate, the k-FDR, generalizing the usual notion of false discovery rate (FDR), and proposed a procedure controlling it based on the k-dimensional joint distributions of the null p-values and assuming MTP2 (multivariate totally positive of order two) positive dependence among all the p-values. In this article, we assume a less restrictive form of positive dependence than MTP2, and develop alternative procedures based only on the bivariate distributions of the null p-values.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sanat K.

fcc9550dd70da4c499a500a8a0c7b5e3184650f7,Controlling the False Discovery Rate via Knockoff for High Dimensional Ising Model Variable Selection,"In high dimensional data analysis, it is important to effectively control the fraction of false discoveries and ensure large enough power for variable selection. In a lot of contemporary data applications, a large set of covariates are discrete variables. In this paper we propose Ising knockoff (IKF) for variable selection in high dimensional regression with discrete covariates. Under mild conditions, we show that the false discovery rate (FDR) is controlled under a target level in a finite sample if the underlying Ising model is known, and the FDR is asymptotically controlled even when the parameters of the Ising model is estimated. We also provide theoretical results on the power for our proposed method. Using simulations and a genome science data set, we show that IKF has higher power than existing knockoff procedures mostly tailored for continuous covariate distributions.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yuxiang Xie"", ids = ""2248082""); list(name = ""Kwun Chuen Gary Chan"", ids = ""8306925"")",,,arXiv: Methodology,,
c7a9c86600af80638aeede4e943b79b41bb85f32,Common single nucleotide polymorphisms in immunoregulatory genes and multiple myeloma risk among women in Connecticut.,"In light of the relationship between immune system dysregulation and multiple myeloma (MM) risk, we investigated whether genetic variation in 92 immune function genes among 77 gene regions are associated with MM susceptibility in a population-based case-control study (108 cases and 482 controls) conducted among Caucasian women in Connecticut. Tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; N = 870) were selected using a pairwise linkage-disequilibrium based algorithm. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for SNP genotypes were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. Tests of association for gene regions were conducted using the minP test. We applied the false discovery rate (FDR) method to the minP test results as a means of controlling for multiple comparisons. The CD4 gene region located on 12p13-q13 (minP = 0.0009), had an FDR value <0.1. In this region, a total of six tag SNPs in two genes (CD4 and LAG3) were significantly associated with MM risk (P(trend)<0.05), with the strongest association observed for the CD4 variant rs11064392 (OR(AG/GG) = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.59-4.02). Our findings suggest that genetic variation in CD4 may influence susceptibility to MM. Additional studies are needed to replicate these findings and, more generally, to explore the manner in which genes and receptors may influence the pathogenesis of this poorly understood malignancy.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Kyoung-Mu Lee"", ids = ""5389020""); list(name = ""Dalsu Baris"", ids = ""6967182""); list(name = ""Yawei Zhang"", ids = ""2987775""); list(name = ""Howard Dean Hosgood"", ids = ""3911249""); list(name = ""Idan Menashe"", ids = ""1837051""); list(name = ""Meredith Ann Yeager"", ids = ""144233652""); list(name = ""Shelia Hoar Zahm"", ids = ""4424289""); list(name = ""Sophia Wang"", ids = ""40658590""); list(name = ""Mark P.

14a926755d46fae77372fe59b225c8ca09b15f77,Deciphering human gene regulation using computational and statistical methods,"It is estimated that at least 10-20% of the mammalian genome is dedicated towards regulating the 1-2% of the genome that codes for proteins. This non-coding, regulatory layer is a necessity for the development of complex organisms, but is poorly understood compared to the genetic code used to translate coding DNA into proteins. In this dissertation, I will discuss methods developed to better understand the gene regulatory layer. I begin, in Chapter 1, with a broad overview of gene regulation, motivation for studying it, the state of the art with a historically context and where to look forward. In Chapter 2, I discuss a computational method developed to detect transcription factor (TF) complexes. The method compares co-occurring motif spacings in conserved versus unconserved regions of the human genome to detect evolutionarily constrained binding sites of rigid transcription factor (TF) complexes. Structural data were integrated to explore overlapping motif arrangements while ensuring physical plausibility of the TF complex. Using this approach, I predicted 422 physically realistic TF complex motifs at 18% false discovery rate (FDR). I found that the set of complexes is enriched in known TF complexes. Additionally, novel complexes were supported by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets. Analysis of the structural modeling revealed three cooperativity mechanisms and a tendency of TF pairs to synergize through overlapping binding to the same DNA base pairs in opposite grooves or strands. The TF complexes and associated binding site predictions are made available as a web resource at http://complex.stanford.edu. Next, in Chapter 3, I discuss how gene enrichment analysis can be applied to genome-wide conserved binding sites to successfully infer regulatory functions for a",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Harendra Guturu"", ids = ""2990587"")",,8d46aed3ed273bfeaa04f395120834c6c401fc52;

f5b3ebd074eca6ca4f1494d8342d7638ec3150ef,Phenotypical profile and global transcriptomic profile of Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae due to carbapenemase-encoding plasmid acquisition,"BackgroundPlasmids play an vital role in driving the rapid global spread of antimicrobial resistance and adaptation to changing ambient conditions. It has been suggested that the presence of plasmids can pose tremendous impacts on the host physiology. However, little is known regarding the contributions of carbapenemase-encoding plasmid carriage on the physiology and pathogenicity of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP).ResultsHere we performed a transcriptomic analysis of hvKP with or without carbapenemase-encoding plasmid p24835-NDM5. The results had shown 683 genes with differential expression (false discovery rate, â‰¤0.001; >â€‰2-fold change), of which 107 were up-regulated and 576 were down-regulated. Gene groups with functions relating to carbohydrate metabolism and multidrug efflux system were increased in genes with increased expression, and those relating to capsule biosynthesis and virulence factors were increased in the genes with decreased expression. In agreement with these changes, survival rate of TfpNDM-hvKP in the presence of normal human serum decreased, and competitive index (CI values) indicated significant fitness defects in the plasmid-carrying hvKP strain when co-cultured with its plasmid-free isogenic ancestor and the ATCC control. Moreover, the p24835-NDM5-containing hvKP strain retained its high neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis and murine lethality.ConclusionThese data indicate that hvKP responds to carbapenemase-encoding plasmid by altering the expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, antibiotic resistance, capsule biosynthesis and virulence expression. Apart from antibiotic resistance selective advantages, carbapenemase-encoding plasmid carriage may also lead to virulence change or adaption to specific habitats in hvKP strain.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dan Long"", ids = ""48811657""); list(name = ""Lan-lan Zhu"", ids = ""21944232""); list(name = ""Fang-ling Du"", ids = ""47943479""); list(name = ""Tian-xin Xiang"", ids = ""14629374""); list(name = ""La-Gen Wan"", ids = ""3550744""); list(name = ""Dan-dan Wei"", ids = ""37451689""); list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""50549803""); list(name = ""Yanhong Liu"", ids = ""47908968"")",661487e59b08ae090880de8b936acd2ffeac8b5e,156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; c8988b78dafc8ed57fa3468a09ea208827019b85; d5ed576effa823c176c54c935cdb97496095c32a; d62edbe9e92575b4898209aab97c7085ac88c931; 1beaff6c2fda45a0ca3dbf8dc764dc676c9d7afc; 91ad93df7cd4f20126f0b061525e0e76ec248fee; eeb4ed7aecd1758df12f1667e7c095f9d26b1792; 363c05be24bdba5523d24452c40611bbf10f099b; 9febffe0ad3d09eb700e5d2104b2c41669db8305; 4c4bea58bff906efcad758327da5db32935b76f7; 11e7fc482058479fd0ff433a34384ecfb868f11c; 10c96ae0cea59b0952ba1df041622e8d43f82e9b; b36398cc188dd979502d8ca2f413a6295ef7a9d7; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 400921c9f24176e392c2ab5253649d7d387f0434; a2f30c42940b61cf02b2ee758ecaa2da3a4685c1; 5b2e034be421be66ce54979dadfbb68e1adaf4c0; 904e7d12b3741abab0358c055488d9235dc20899; 7a4d05058b7bb1eb3eab621542e13148d87c13ec; 7d26a817f0f24d691e11b6e7b208c384ea8e2e38; 23587481fa9673a8083a9ff484c3d0e1596a843d; 28e302174577f41f3f82a4468bd4a69590a82c1e; 71816945336e96158440a1d8ccbfae6929beb76e; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; 6001cce54a79250bca6a4fd12ba69dd83b0792c2; 87ccc438b0c73fcfdea48485fcdb091a8ecaa89c; 673bc7eb370db79fa1670640be10644d58ebc1a2; 13ceda93a3f46544d59fad1c22c6e07c03bf515a; df0724d619cb18649304b6a8107ff715a09e6be1; 6c18f81c085794346c42963efc9e04f273922fb4; 62720b9df05bd4567f692eb3116213d644db9d9e; 3ce3346e06acc2f3fe5bb373663b1678dce66137; 15591f67e297d2a91dd2cd0adec8a3406f301cd5; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; 30b6d2f3a32d75da2362020e38ab035e2c1e8089; f48c4ec5b4365a90afe49f26d46ba6c315a9d18c; 2e1362a9ce281e56b51a950c8839e2ff6aeed46f,BMC Genomics,20,

In this paper, we compared the performance of the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0â€‰ST array with the Human Exon 1.0â€‰ST array for detecting nasal smoking-related gene expression changes. RNA collected from the nasal epithelium of five current smokers and five never smokers was hybridized to both arrays. While the intersample correlation within each array platform was relatively higher in the Gene array than that in the Exon array, the majority of the genes most changed by smoking were tightly correlated between platforms. Although neither array dataset was powered to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at a false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05, we identified more DEGs than expected by chance using the Gene ST array. These findings suggest that while both platforms show a high degree of correlation for detecting smoking-induced differential gene expression changes, the Gene ST array may be a more cost-effective platform in a clinical setting for gene-level genomewide expression profiling and an effective tool for exploring the host response to cigarette smoking and other inhaled toxins.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaoling Zhang"", ids = ""1724720""); list(name = ""Marc E.

7353b40e8b9c8ead67b44f79c22d678e664730be,Alcohol craving: the role of stress from early life to adulthood,"training influences cortical thickness development, thickness was regressed against an â€œAge Ã— Years of Playingâ€ interaction term. Age, gender, total brain volume, and scanner were controlled for in analyses. Subject ID was entered as a random effect to account for within-person dependence. False discovery rate correction was applied to the entire cortical surface (q â‰¤ 0.05). Results: There was no association between cortical thickness and years of playing a musical instrument. The â€œAge Ã— Years of Playingâ€ interaction term was associated with thickness in a number of regions including right premotor and primary motor cortices, left primary and supplementary motor cortices, bilateral parietal cortices, as well as bilateral orbitofrontal cortices. Follow-up analysis revealed that musical training was associated with an increased rate of thinning in these regions. Results were largely unchanged when IQ and handedness were included as covariates. Conclusions: These findings suggest that, among youths and young adults, playing a musical instrument influences cerebral cortical development. Specifically, playing a musical instrument was associated with more rapid cortical thickness development within areas implicated in motor planning and coordination, visuospatial ability, and, interestingly, emotion regulation. However, given the quasi-experimental nature of this study, we cannot rule out the influence of potentially confounding variables.",2013,Psychology,"list(name = ""Jong-Hoon Kim"", ids = ""47964430""); list(name = ""Silvia S Martins"", ids = ""1852331""); list(name = ""JuliÃ¡n Santaella"", ids = ""50125345""); list(name = ""Deborah S Hasin"", ids = ""6218433"")",,,Comprehensive Psychiatry,54,
e3385278010173207ab825d0d716d3966608a048,Asymptotic Theory of a Non-Marginal Multiple Testing Procedure and Comparison With Existing Methods,"Recently, Chandra and Bhattacharya (2016) proposed a novel and general Bayesian multiple comparison method such that the decision on any hypothesis depends upon the joint posterior probability of the hypotheses on which the current hypothesis is strongly dependent. Here we investigate the asymptotic properties of their methodology, establishing in particular rates of convergence to zero of several versions of Bayesian false discovery rate and Bayesian false non-discovery rate associated with the non-marginal approach, as the sample size tends to infinity. 
We also establish convergence properties of several other established multiple testing methods, each representing a class of methodologies, and show that the non-marginal method is as good as the existing ones in that the associated versions of Bayesian false non-discovery rate converge to zero at the same rate, compared to the other methods, when versions of Bayesian false discovery rate are asymptotically controlled. 
Moreover, we also propose a novel method to retrospectively compare the decision configurations obtained by the non-marginal method and the other methods in small samples, by conceptually extending the available finite sample to a sufficiently large sample. In this regard, we show that the decision configuration obtained from the non-marginal method minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the true decision configuration, and hence, is optimal in this sense, compared to all existing methods. In fact, we are able to prove that the non-marginal method retrospectively yields the Bayes oracle with respect to a loss function based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Noirrit Kiran Chandra"", ids = ""82640866""); list(name = ""Sourabh Bhattacharya"", ids = ""2845949"")",,,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,
4d3d1745d485d5f35ee703880f9667e5b42b7257,Proteogenomic Analysis to Identify Missing Proteins from Haploid Cell Lines.,"Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project aims at identifying and characterizing protein products encoded from all human protein-coding genes. As of early 2017, 19Â 837 protein-coding genes have been annotated in the neXtProt database including 2691 missing proteins that have never been identified by mass spectrometry. Missing proteins may be low abundant in many cell types or expressed only in a few cell types in human body such as sperms in testis. In this study, we performed expression proteomics of two near-haploid cell types such as HAP1 and KBM-7 to hunt for missing proteins. Proteomes from the two haploid cell lines were analyzed on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos, producing a total of 200 raw mass spectrometry files. After applying 1% false discovery rates at both levels of peptide-spectrum matches and proteins, more than 10Â 000 proteins were identified from HAP1 and KBM-7, resulting in the identification of nine missing proteins. Next, unmatched spectra were searched against protein databases translated in three frames from noncoding RNAs derived from RNA-Seq data, resulting in six novel protein-coding regions after careful manual inspection. This study demonstrates that expression proteomics coupled to proteogenomic analysis can be employed to identify many annotated and unannotated missing proteins.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Seung-Eun Lee"", ids = ""2293946""); list(name = ""JongKeon Song"", ids = ""35512909""); list(name = ""Korbinian BÃ¶sl"", ids = ""49988495""); list(name = ""AndrÃ© C MÃ¼ller"", ids = ""6985725""); list(name = ""Dijana Vitko"", ids = ""6181345""); list(name = ""Keiryn L.

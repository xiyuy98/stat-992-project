a041c8d41ffaf6d9f91b09822fe16f878420da26,Multiple testing on standardized mortality ratios: a Bayesian hierarchical model for FDR estimation.,"The analysis of large data sets of standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), obtained by collecting observed and expected disease counts in a map of contiguous regions, is a first step in descriptive epidemiology to detect potential environmental risk factors. A common situation arises when counts are collected in small areas, that is, where the expected count is very low, and disease risks underlying the map are spatially correlated. Traditional p-value-based methods, which control the false discovery rate (FDR) by means of Poisson p-values, might achieve small sensitivity in identifying risk in small areas. This problem is the focus of the present work, where a Bayesian approach which performs a test to evaluate the null hypothesis of no risk over each SMR and controls the posterior FDR is proposed. A Bayesian hierarchical model including spatial random effects to allow for extra-Poisson variability is implemented providing estimates of the posterior probabilities that the null hypothesis of absence of risk is true. By means of such posterior probabilities, an estimate of the posterior FDR conditional on the data can be computed. A conservative estimation is needed to achieve the control which is checked by simulation. The availability of this estimate allows the practitioner to determine nonarbitrary FDR-based selection rules to identify high-risk areas according to a preset FDR level. Sensitivity and specificity of FDR-based rules are studied via simulation and a comparison with p-value-based rules is also shown. A real data set is analyzed using rules based on several FDR levels.",2011,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Massimo Ventrucci"", ids = ""15791008""); list(name = ""E.

f6ed6b433e2a2628b0aca3256d7b2bb4165e3b2b,In-Depth Transcriptome Sequencing of Mexican Lime Trees Infected with Candidatus Phytoplasma aurantifolia,"Witches' broom disease of acid lime greatly affects the production of Mexican lime in Iran. It is caused by a phytoplasma (Candidatus Phytoplasma aurantifolia). However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie phytoplasma pathogenicity and the mode of interactions with host plants are largely unknown. Here, high-throughput transcriptome sequencing was conducted to explore gene expression signatures associated with phytoplasma infection in Mexican lime trees. We assembled 78,185 unique transcript sequences (unigenes) with an average length of 530 nt. Of these, 41,805 (53.4%) were annotated against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database using a BLASTx search (e-value â‰¤ 1e-5). When the abundances of unigenes in healthy and infected plants were compared, 2,805 transcripts showed significant differences (false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.001 and log2 ratio â‰¥ 1.5). These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in 43 KEGG metabolic and regulatory pathways. The up-regulated DEGs were mainly categorized into pathways with possible implication in plant-pathogen interaction, including cell wall biogenesis and degradation, sucrose metabolism, secondary metabolism, hormone biosynthesis and signalling, amino acid and lipid metabolism, while down-regulated DEGs were predominantly enriched in ubiquitin proteolysis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Our analysis provides novel insight into the molecular pathways that are deregulated during the host-pathogen interaction in Mexican lime trees infected by phytoplasma. The findings can be valuable for unravelling the molecular mechanisms of plant-phytoplasma interactions and can pave the way for engineering lime trees with resistance to witches' broom disease.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mohsen Mardi"", ids = ""50427057""); list(name = ""Laleh Karimi Farsad"", ids = ""5083255""); list(name = ""Javad Gharechahi"", ids = ""4301319""); list(name = ""Ghasem Hosseini Salekdeh"", ids = ""4389040"")",a4605af561f3c5fa4dee537c0e40ffbe092dc8b5; 9805ef707f43067ddc14fd3339cf7bd5b6b8fe09; 4db47d8af9cdbf24b1eb1eb79540e8a68e9f70fe; 7afd6e341e2d637f5f1f9001b553f73d547fd2ba; 9a6b60e2eb1a8a7cd1d97e8065d40ef6b292b155; 0c543d9d2074f7ace6d05416a0639629fdbfbf76; 14381fe768c71b346648ddcda4d223813eed4c7b; c2e2db1e22b81f11646af6190c47bf6a155621e5; 50adc14e71d47cdccaee3f951d2104827bece33a; f6a1f21963483095a5db31c2542776149c0f80d6; 666fb904924b2387d67ffde82d4a247eb81619cb; 232b726953a70d3ec0fb5215049bec5f376a70bf; 27139caddf539c231a4fc061f7d280668e6bc2ae; 1bec92128d03c42c7354e234d97a056e8303ba4b,1f84e9d8af73a60c539ff4dca3a8ca471d7c69ac; a0436fc2001f681e465c87b478f35798fe56c4fe; 5da60059c776b5f236da410ab7427aa96d2f4f80; c24fb839af61e274548b85f21a03539f3dfda58b; 32e48251d870f4c8cb9ae33fee9c8804f2a27b7f; 4d277d672fe8b72bae67c27c1cce117539b5f66e; ad394b40743f515b48cab11a6da30bf66961b9a8; 15d63d21db8364fd35fdba15e99839ad54c49db8; bc103d96366ec97e0dd620894bbb04c8849eb772; 521fda4d279906ce4230feb38980e5095fa14ad0; a8beaa15ac328148db9dce2dfd9af36c226d7682; 091f9927c272e69f2604e75d07dd85da34557554; 0e1659a2b753141160f11ac37e286ddb0d36306d; 55f5e4f69932899c01dced2e53c311a444d81431; 0254f44107d5183282105af49a4a08b1182aa7ad; a840036022228b834c19c7e23cae8f1a1e37f28a; bb1ac724c591a46d1325adc3707d6c0e560e7113; b259267ea14d048e7bd713e6b8b949571a200e77; c94921341d98f1f49c9ca5200ae6143bd8ee6614; 9b7ac99e9e6c946cc39822c39cdaa2b8e96fdd0b; b1ccda4e876d03e370b27057b9ac031d90dd3266; f1186fd8a075ae7cdc71a9604de9e415d12d0b4a; ec27a1f0b5655736eaa7ef20cef274a75fa8ba14; 5b9e0b1c109c6d6a663cbeb8f358c20606e1734d; cf52a1395bf1f0c4dd829d3dda8f228bd4a27cb9; c45af62abe8e18a896834ec23acf83355e9378b3; ffe1c622ada0445238e770c20630b2cab60b51a4; eca7cd8ee8a9ee4de94d0ed3eade27f500a17fb1; 3299695c609ddfe1adf440cf6efc68b6e3b3243c; 7a2ba65cdb38acc77413dda2e2a1b968ffb08731; c6e319a023f932d6d2ff8897c2c91e56e872db8e; 96853b8bf7e36c5dd5338e2be50acacf521ea255; 7a98ea0d1de1badfe39dae4aa9c472bed716afba; e6c0ed9a2c3f786d8e1164849245794b38fbc50e; 5f152fa68cebfbcd908ed3b11a3921a4e8ad0975; d7ff71d4333d4938f7adc827d152f491f57e1374; 241d608844fd05a08c06ccaacda676a5fff8bdd1; 70a7b685a88d9f66256679cf0ed6d05a2d9f4c41; eff5a378c79354b087b13c9c73e8be529895e162; 941934f1c143ed2c653b372a25d2aa82ebb08787; d89c03560df2b861e48e38579b29bceea3fcdb39; f495e2121f80daa23377af2d80d69eefb03eee5e; 8aa77b42f5a83737acde7c3f51320ae2641b099a; 13ceda93a3f46544d59fad1c22c6e07c03bf515a; 71cd9f2ce7072705df33637c3f8673141c341527; 813c8088c6d37baeb37c4f83ecc1367f53fcfb61; a2f30c42940b61cf02b2ee758ecaa2da3a4685c1; 5252689d015e7882db7ff4eb10d71e79ec2bb0b3; 9d701478a8d06e567a1558caa74328257ef81186; 3b5972e205178769d57a66e59eb992f1aaea417d; e4c2d1f7614004702f3c8fe7e6b9f76c10571186; f4c4902636de6a0ec4aea3ee7ec939e59cd775dd; f3efe6247b6eef8ed4bb7474aa39d349ea24e4bf; dde498b3e2c67ccff047a7c1fc777e795562e393; e440b377027544c9b7161f5c3cafb53ab4c25af4; fb27a1e2da80ac40e93e8bee4e7ffd523c8b01a6; 1a3555826ef68df33933414fb8a0724ad715e97d; 9b02b233c939b5674b89be16533a555f5471c95d; f526714704214ab5e8bd087006e6c565409ce133; 28bfe8350e11a0e9c0f0405080a28991852087e4; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; 6f570033c1d07467276ad185bf1521cd736c5f3f; f044e2c9d9f8cded382b94eae0a8f4829a64834a; f999428a85630e8b28eba424ccd9a4272db38e87; 00f3bc0c8f327ab497cb3584e5a27f101b82cd16; 8c2845479691e9789f3c70935dc082fb3c08f584; 48727c4043e627480041983c8614fdfa1bd4c02d; 9229513cf06cba98033da8be2a5956b566a72524; 65eb4eddb3861c11de962793af7b77eb5136979a; ad46db217d1360d9b3da8f04e9ec3b263dc5d39e; e1564afb8e0cf7a421ae3f33a802746ad85c25ad; 989500e685dcdfcf7fbe95895f5efc985edb914b; d709a1289d606c051cb31130768a51a4f13dff1c; f122f5f998de1e22dc791f204b247c05b11ebb2d; 43a68df207116bc7eb373f06c155f9af432020a3; 3040ac52b3154de53a831715f2ce7f4e7d3d723b; 42d23c0f14c07123b3c3d9a9e3f51e5e94db8b65; 008936cb66dccf804becbd016c57e69e088c3aa2; 93801675d98cf8df39465bccbd5575303a97ff5d,PLoS ONE,10,
090b3d4b765dcbaf5265f6d371500ed2a5469ecc,Relations of brain volumes with cognitive function in males 45 years and older with past lead exposure,"We examined relations between brain volumes assessed by MRI and cognitive function in subjects in whom we have previously reported associations of cumulative lead dose with: (1) longitudinal declines in cognitive function; (2) smaller volumes of several regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain; and (3) increased prevalence and severity of white matter lesions. We used two complementary methods (ROI- [evaluating 20 ROIs] and voxel-wise) to examine associations between brain volumes and cognitive function using multiple linear regression. MRIs and cognitive testing were obtained from 532 former organolead workers with a mean (SD) age of 56.1 (7.7) years and a mean of 18.0 (11.0) years since the last occupational exposure to lead at the time of MRI acquisition. Cognitive testing was grouped into six domains of function (visuo-construction, verbal memory and learning, visual memory, executive functioning, eye-hand coordination, processing speed). Results indicated that larger ROI volumes were associated with better cognitive function in five of six cognitive domains, with significant associations observed for visuo-construction (15 of 20, p<or=0.05), processing speed (12, p<or=0.05), visual memory (11, p<or=0.05), executive functioning (11, p<or=0.05), and eye-hand coordination (11, p<or=0.05). Significant structure-function relations were also identified in the voxel-wise analysis with low false discovery rates (all less than 2.2%). Thus, larger volumes were associated with better cognitive function using both ROI- and voxel-based methods. In this cohort, an interesting group in which to examine structure-function relations, this finding provides a necessary condition to support the hypothesis that lead may influence cognitive function by its effect on brain volumes.",2007,Psychology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Brian S.

d9e2a43715b103e66d940cb52c98248bbe7d7afb,Single-index modulated multiple testing,"In the context of large-scale multiple testing, hypotheses are often accompanied with certain prior information. In this paper, we present a single-index modulated (SIM) multiple testing procedure, which maintains control of the false discovery rate while incorporating prior information, by assuming the availability of a bivariate $p$-value, $(p_1,p_2)$, for each hypothesis, where $p_1$ is a preliminary $p$-value from prior information and $p_2$ is the primary $p$-value for the ultimate analysis. To find the optimal rejection region for the bivariate $p$-value, we propose a criteria based on the ratio of probability density functions of $(p_1,p_2)$ under the true null and nonnull. This criteria in the bivariate normal setting further motivates us to project the bivariate $p$-value to a single-index, $p(\theta)$, for a wide range of directions $\theta$. The true null distribution of $p(\theta)$ is estimated via parametric and nonparametric approaches, leading to two procedures for estimating and controlling the false discovery rate. To derive the optimal projection direction $\theta$, we propose a new approach based on power comparison, which is further shown to be consistent under some mild conditions. Simulation evaluations indicate that the SIM multiple testing procedure improves the detection power significantly while controlling the false discovery rate.

456c5473e98f412c7de6d7d911582d6e50933613,Allelic heterogeneity and more detailed analyses of known loci explain additional phenotypic variation and reveal complex patterns of association,"The identification of multiple signals at individual loci could explain additional phenotypic variance ('missing heritability') of common traits, and help identify causal genes. We examined gene expression levels as a model trait because of the large number of strong genetic effects acting in cis. Using expression profiles from 613 individuals, we performed genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses to identify cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), and conditional analysis to identify second signals. We examined patterns of association when accounting for multiple SNPs at a locus and when including additional SNPs from the 1000 Genomes Project. We identified 1298 cis-eQTLs at an approximate false discovery rate 0.01, of which 118 (9%) showed evidence of a second independent signal. For this subset of 118 traits, accounting for two signals resulted in an average 31% increase in phenotypic variance explained (Wilcoxon P< 0.0001). The association of SNPs with cis gene expression could increase, stay similar or decrease in significance when accounting for linkage disequilibrium with second signals at the same locus. Pairs of SNPs increasing in significance tended to have gene expression increasing alleles on opposite haplotypes, whereas pairs of SNPs decreasing in significance tended to have gene expression increasing alleles on the same haplotypes. Adding data from the 1000 Genomes Project showed that apparently independent signals could be potentially explained by a single association signal. Our results show that accounting for multiple variants at a locus will increase the variance explained in a substantial fraction of loci, but that allelic heterogeneity will be difficult to define without resequencing loci and functional work.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrew R Wood"", ids = ""8493079""); list(name = ""Dena G Hernandez"", ids = ""145562703""); list(name = ""Michael A.

To assess the impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on predefined severe adverse events in breast cancer (BC) patients receiving (neo-)adjuvant 5-fluorouracil (FU), epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC) chemotherapy.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Twenty-six SNPs in 16 genes of interest, including the drug transporter gene ABCC1/MRP1, were selected based on a literature survey. An additional 33 SNPs were selected in these genes, as well as in 12 other genes known to be involved in the metabolism of the studied chemotherapeutics. One thousand and twelve female patients treated between 2000 and 2010 with 3-6 cycles of (neo-)adjuvant FEC were genotyped for these SNPs using Sequenom MassARRAY. Severe adverse events were evaluated through an electronic chart review for febrile neutropenia (FN, primary end point), FN first cycle, prolonged grade 4 or deep (<100/Âµl) neutropenia, anemia grade 3-4, thrombocytopenia grade 3-4 and non-hematological grade 3-4 events (secondary end points).


RESULTS
Carriers of the rs4148350 variant T-allele in ABCC1/MRP1 were associated with FN relative to homozygous carriers of the G-allele [P = 0.0006; false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.026]. Strong correlations with secondary end points such as prolonged grade 4 neutropenia (P = 0.002, FDR = 0.046) were also observed. Additionally, two other SNPs in ABCC1/MRP1 (rs45511401 and rs246221) correlated with FN (P = 0.007 and P = 0.01, respectively; FDR = 0.16 and 0.19), as well as two SNPs in UGT2B7 and FGFR4 (P = 0.024 and P = 0.04; FDR = 0.28 and 0.38).

The purpose of this investigation was to assess the neuropathologic correlates of regional brainvolumes by combining ex-vivoMRvolumetry and pathology on a large community cohort of older persons. Methods: Cerebral hemispheres were obtained from 166 deceased participants of two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging. All hemispheres were imaged ex-vivo, while immersed in 4% formaldehyde solution, on a 3T MRI scanner. A multi-atlas approach was used to segment ex-vivo MRI data intowhite and gray matter, and graymatter into 34 cortical and 8 subcortical regions. The volumes of all regions were normalized by the height of the participants. Following imaging, hemispheres underwent neuropathologic examination. The pathologies that were considered in analyses were: Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) pathology, Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, gross and microscopic chronic infarcts, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Multiple linear regression was used to investigate the link between regional volumes and neuropathologies, controlling for age at death, sex, education, postmortem interval to fixation and to imaging. False Discovery Rate (FDR) was used to correct for multiple comparisons.Results: Figure 1 shows brain regions with significant negative correlation (p<0.05, FDR-corrected) between their volume and AD pathology (Fig.1A), and hippocampal sclerosis (Fig.1B). No other pathologies showed significant correlations with the volume of the segmented regions. Conclusions: The present study provides information on the neuropathologic correlates of regional brain volumes in a community cohort of older adults, and may help in the development of imaging biomarkers of AD pathology and hippocampal sclerosis. To our knowledge, this is the largest MR volumetry pathology investigation to date, and the only assessing a high number of brain regions.",2014,Psychology,"list(name = ""Bernardino F.

ff8871aabf84615264b6c72d77f4f8be82669b55,Family-Based Genetic Association for Molar-Incisor Hypomineralization,"Despite some evidence of genetic and environmental factors on molar-incisor hypomineralization (MIH), its aetiology remains unclear. This family-based genetic association study aimed more comprehensively to investigate the genetic carriage potentially involved in MIH development. DNA was obtained from buccal cells of 391 individuals who were birth family members of 101 Brazilian nuclear families. Sixty-three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were investigated in 21 candidate genes related to amelogenesis using the TaqManâ„¢ OpenArrayâ„¢ Genotyping platform. All SNPs were genotyped in 165 birth family members unaffected by MIH, 96 with unknown MIH status and 130 affected individuals (50.7% with severe MIH). Association analysis was performed by the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT), and statistical results were corrected using the false discovery rate. Significant results were obtained for SNPs rs7821494 (FAM83H gene, OR = 3.7; 95% CI = 1.75-7.78), rs34367704 (AMBN gene, OR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.16-6.58), rs3789334 (BMP2 gene, OR = 2.9; 95% CI = 1.34-6.35), rs6099486 (BMP7 gene, OR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.14-4.38), rs762642 (BMP4 gene, OR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.38-3.65), rs7664896 (ENAM gene, OR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.19-3.51), rs1711399 (MMP20 gene, OR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.20-0.72), rs1711423 (MMP20 gene, OR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.18-3.61), rs2278163 (DLX3 gene, OR = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.26-6.41), rs6996321 (FGFR1 gene, OR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.20-5.88), and rs5979395 (AMELX gene, OR = 11.7; 95% CI = 1.63-84.74). Through this family-based association study, we concluded that variations in genes related to amelogenesis were associated with the susceptibility to develop MIH.

c843d0d191ae33b53052fc8d2b49dbaf41f351b1,Cancer outlier detection based on likelihood ratio test,"MOTIVATION
Microarray experiments can be used to help study the role of chromosomal translocation in cancer development through cancer outlier detection. The aim is to identify genes that are up- or down-regulated in a subset of cancer samples in comparison to normal samples.


RESULTS
We propose a likelihood-based approach which targets detecting the change of point in mean expression intensity in the group of cancer samples. A desirable property of the proposed approach is the availability of theoretical significance-level results. Simulation studies showed that the performance of the proposed approach is appealing in terms of both detection power and false discovery rate. And the real data example also favored the likelihood-based approach in terms of the biological relevance of the results.

Laboratoire dâ€™accueil Centre de recherche en epidemiologie et sante des populations, Equipe 6Â â€“Â Epidemiologie environnementale des cancers (dirigee par Jacqueline Clavel), Villejuif, France. Contexte et objectif La leucemie de lâ€™enfant est une maladie rare qui represente un tiers des cancers pediatriques en France. Plusieurs causes environnementales potentielles font lâ€™objet de recherches actuelles, dont des agregats localises de cas pourraient etre le reflet. La detection de clusters a fait lâ€™objet du developpement de nombreuses methodes statistiques. La methode SaTScan, qui est la plus utilisee et la plus performante sous des alternatives particulieres, consiste a deplacer des fenetres elliptiques de tailles et inclinaisons differentes sur tout le territoire etudie afin dâ€™identifier la zone de cluster la plus vraisemblable. Cette methode a une bonne puissance mais tend a detecter des clusters plus etendus que le cluster reel sous-jacent. La detection des clusters mieux localises peut etre plus appropriee. Methode Deux nouvelles approches qui testent en meme temps plusieurs clusters locaux et controlent le Â«Â False Discovery RateÂ Â» (FDR) ont ete etudiees. La base commune de ces methodes est de realiser un test de Poisson dans chaque unite geographique et de regarder sâ€™il y a un exces dâ€™incidence dans chaque unite. Dans le cadre de distributions de Poisson independantes avec de petits nombres de cas attendus, lâ€™hypothese des p-values uniformes (0, 1) sous lâ€™hypothese nulle, sur laquelle les approches fondees sur le FDR sont basees, nâ€™est pas verifiee. La premiere methode envisagee, Yscan, est basee sur la transformation dâ€™une loi discrete en loi continue, en ajoutant un bruit. En ayant ainsi une distribution des p-values sous H0Â uniformes, lâ€™approche du FDR proposee par Benjamini et Hochberg a ete utilisee. La deuxieme methode, SD-LBE, consiste a adapter la methode de Storey pour controler le FDR sous lâ€™hypothese dâ€™une distribution marginale de p-values a trois composantes. Ces deux nouvelles methodes, SaTScan et la classique methode de Bonferroni utilisee pour controler le FWER, ont ete evaluees et comparees par simulation dans trois scenarios particuliers de distribution des cas de leucemie de lâ€™enfant (RNHE, NÂ =Â 7675) sur la periode 1990â€“2006Â a lâ€™echelle des 1916Â bassins de vie francais. Resultats Toutes les methodes ont ete testees dans trois scenarios realistes.

6baaf0385940b60145ab7215466b07629e9b6e9a,Identification of epistasis loci underlying rice flowering time by controlling population stratification and polygenic effect,"Flowering time is an important agronomic trait, attributed by multiple genes, geneâ€“gene interactions and environmental factors. Population stratification and polygenic effects might confound genetic effects of the causal loci underlying this complex trait. We proposed a two-step approach for detecting epistasis interactions underlying rice flowering time by accounting population structure and polygenic effects. Simulation studies showed that the approach used in this study performs better than classical and PC-linear approaches in terms of powers and false discovery rates in the case of population stratification and polygenic effects. Whole genome epistasis analyses identified 589 putative genetic interactions for flowering time. Eighteen of these interactions are located within 10 kilobases of regions of known proteinâ€“protein interactions. Thirty-seven SNPs near to twenty-five genes involve in rice or/and Arabidopsis (orthologue) flowering pathway. Bioinformatics analysis showed that 66.55% pairwise genes of the identified interactions (392 out of the 589 interactions) have similarity in various genomic features. Moreover, significant numbers of detected epistatic genes have high expression in different floral tissues. Our findings highlight the importance of epistasis analysis by controlling population stratification and polygenic effect and provided novel insights into the genetic architecture of rice flowering which could assist breeding programmes.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Asif Ahsan"", ids = ""12725448""); list(name = ""Mamun Monir"", ids = ""66772141""); list(name = ""Xianwen Meng"", ids = ""3326383""); list(name = ""Matiur Rahaman"", ids = ""1826007""); list(name = ""Hongjun Chen"", ids = ""49177725""); list(name = ""Ming Chen"", ids = ""48622703"")",,,DNA Research: An International Journal for Rapid Publication of Reports on Genes and Genomes,26,193 - 193
65625b6b22192fbef42d698bfccc2488ab46994a,Detection of selection signatures in dairy and beef cattle using high-density genomic information,"BackgroundArtificial selection for economically important traits in cattle is expected to have left distinctive selection signatures on the genome. Access to high-density genotypes facilitates the accurate identification of genomic regions that have undergone positive selection. These findings help to better elucidate the mechanisms of selection and to identify candidate genes of interest to breeding programs.ResultsInformation on 705 243 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 3122 dairy and beef male animals from seven cattle breeds (Angus, Belgian Blue, Charolais, Hereford, Holstein-Friesian, Limousin and Simmental) were used to detect selection signatures by applying two complementary methods, integrated haplotype score (iHS) and global fixation index (FST). To control for false positive results, we used false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment to calculate adjusted iHS within each breed and the genome-wide significance level was about 0.003. Using the iHS method, 83, 92, 91, 101, 85, 101 and 86 significant genomic regions were detected for Angus, Belgian Blue, Charolais, Hereford, Holstein-Friesian, Limousin and Simmental cattle, respectively. None of these regions was common to all seven breeds. Using the FST approach, 704 individual SNPs were detected across breeds. Annotation of the regions of the genome that showed selection signatures revealed several interesting candidate genes i.e. DGAT1, ABCG2, MSTN, CAPN3, FABP3, CHCHD7, PLAG1, JAZF1, PRKG2, ACTC1, TBC1D1, GHR, BMP2, TSG1, LYN, KIT and MC1R that play a role in milk production, reproduction, body size, muscle formation or coat color. Fifty-seven common candidate genes were found by both the iHS and global FST methods across the seven breeds. Moreover, many novel genomic regions and genes were detected within the regions that showed selection signatures; for some candidate genes, signatures of positive selection exist in the human genome. Multilevel bioinformatic analyses of the detected candidate genes suggested that the PPAR pathway may have been subjected to positive selection.ConclusionsThis study provides a high-resolution bovine genomic map of positive selection signatures that are either specific to one breed or common to a subset of the seven breeds analyzed. Our results will contribute to the detection of functional candidate genes that have undergone positive selection in future studies.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Fuping Zhao"", ids = ""21733666""); list(name = ""SinÃ©ad McParland"", ids = ""4603022""); list(name = ""Francis J Kearney"", ids = ""35755161""); list(name = ""Lixin Du"", ids = ""2618248""); list(name = ""Donagh P.

To extract important information in a systematic time dimension rather than at isolated time points, a weighted method based on the means and variations along the time points was proposed and first applied to previously published rat model data. The method was subsequently extended and applied to prospective metabolomics data analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Permutation was employed for noise filtering and false discovery rate (FDR) was used for parameter optimization during the feature selection.

03f5ecb594fc36eb80d037b72f2208020691d5a0,Comparison of surfactant-assisted shotgun methods using acid-labile surfactants and sodium dodecyl sulfate for membrane proteome analysis.,"Three surfactant-assisted shotgun methods using acid labile surfactants, sodium-3-[(2-methyl-2-undecyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)-methoxyl]-1-propanesulfonate (RapiGest) and 3-[3-(1,1-bisalkyloxyethyl)pyridin-1-yl]propane-1-sulfonate (PPS), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were investigated for their applicability to membrane proteome analysis. It is shown that RapiGest is a preferred reagent for handling membrane proteomes of Escherichia coli and MCF7 cells for liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) analysis of tryptic digests. The RapiGest method allowed identification of more peptides and proteins than the SDS and PPS methods and there was no apparent bias for the type of peptides and proteins identified by the RapiGest and SDS methods, while a slightly higher proportion of hydrophilic peptides and proteins were identified by the PPS method. The performance of the SDS and PPS methods is similar in terms of the numbers of peptides and proteins identified. Since the SDS method required the removal of SDS using a technique such as strong-cation exchange (SCX), we further investigated the effect of SCX on sample loss through analyzing the digest of an enriched E. coli membrane fraction as well as a standard protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA). The results showed that extensive sample loss (as much as 62%) was encountered during the SCX cleaning step. We then applied the RapiGest method in combination with two-dimensional LC MS/MS to characterize the E. coli membrane proteome. In total, 1626 unique proteins (5799 unique peptides) were identified with a peptide false discovery rate of 2.4%. About 60% of the identified proteins with known cellular locations were found to be membrane proteins. Among them, about 75% were integral membrane proteins.

e07ef11edf4b9a7e042444f3f98f0d04ee797626,Comprehensive molecular biomarker identification in breast cancer brain metastases,"BackgroundBreast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) develop in about 20â€“30% of breast cancer (BC) patients. BCBM are associated with dismal prognosis not at least due to lack of valuable molecular therapeutic targets. The aim of the study was to identify new molecular biomarkers and targets in BCBM by using complementary state-of-the-art techniques.MethodsWe compared array expression profiles of three BCBM with 16 non-brain metastatic BC and 16 primary brain tumors (prBT) using a false discovery rate (FDR) pÂ <Â 0.05 and fold change (FC)Â >Â 2. Biofunctional analysis was conducted on the differentially expressed probe sets. High-density arrays were employed to detect copy number variations (CNVs) and whole exome sequencing (WES) with paired-end reads of 150Â bp was utilized to detect gene mutations in the three BCBM.ResultsThe top 370 probe sets that were differentially expressed between BCBM and both BC and prBT were in the majority comparably overexpressed in BCBM and included, e.g. the coding genes BCL3, BNIP3, BNIP3P1, BRIP1, CASP14, CDC25A, DMBT1, IDH2, E2F1, MYCN, RAD51, RAD54L, and VDR. A number of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) were comparably overexpressed in BCBM and included SNORA1, SNORA2A, SNORA9, SNORA10, SNORA22, SNORA24, SNORA30, SNORA37, SNORA38, SNORA52, SNORA71A, SNORA71B, SNORA71C, SNORD13P2, SNORD15A, SNORD34, SNORD35A, SNORD41, SNORD53, and SCARNA22. The top canonical pathway was entitled, role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response. Network analysis revealed key nodes as Akt, ERK1/2, NFkB, and Ras in a predicted activation stage. Downregulated genes in a data set that was shared between BCBM and prBT comprised, e.g. BC cell line invasion markers JUN, MMP3, TFF1, and HAS2. Important cancer genes affected by CNVs included TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2, ERBB2, IDH1, and IDH2. WES detected numerous mutations, some of which affecting BC associated genes as CDH1, HEPACAM, and LOXHD1.ConclusionsUsing complementary molecular genetic techniques, this study identified shared and unshared molecular events in three highly aberrant BCBM emphasizing the challenge to detect new molecular biomarkers and targets with translational implications. Among new findings with the capacity to gain clinical relevance is the detection of overexpressed snoRNAs known to regulate some critical cellular functions as ribosome biogenesis.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hans-Juergen Schulten"", ids = ""6162809""); list(name = ""Mohammed Hasan Bangash"", ids = ""5565272""); list(name = ""Sajjad Karim"", ids = ""39221272""); list(name = ""Ashraf Dallol"", ids = ""5041664""); list(name = ""Deema Hussein"", ids = ""48860118""); list(name = ""Adnan A.

799c24a6606f7e315fd88aab5e46a24cd0b53ff8,Hypermethylation of SNAP91 as an alternative mechanism of epidermal growth factor signalling dysregulation: a genome-wide meta-analysis with validation of colorectal cancers,"Abstract Background Previous whole genome methylation studies have examined homogeneous populations of tumours with biases inherent to manufacturer-specific array-based technologies. Subtle changes in pathways and genes can be lost because of these technologies and because of study-based noise artefacts. Meta-analysis of these datasets might reduce this heterogeneity and reveal novel insights. We aimed to carry out a meta-analysis of all publicly available genome-wide methylation array (GWMA) datasets in colorectal cancer. Methods Datasets were obtained from GEO, ArrayExpress, and the TCGA data repository. Data were collapsed to gene symbol, and data from multiple probes for the same gene were collapsed to a single value. Data were analysed by the MetaDE, GSEA, TMEV, and DAVID to look for patterns of differential methylation in colorectal cancer. Top hits were validated by bisulphite pyrosequencing on a validation cohort of 200 colorectal tumours. Findings We obtained 13 GWMA datasets, providing 383 patients with colorectal cancer and 123 controls. After filtering and meta-analysis, the top ranked differentially methylated gene was SNAP91 (p=1â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10 âˆ’20 , statpmax=5Â·04â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10 âˆ’6 , false discovery rate=1Â·25â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10 âˆ’19 ). We found that SNAP91 methylation segregated into two groups in KRAS / PIK3CA / NRAS / BRAF wild-type tumours, with about 60% of these tumours being hypermethylated at SNAP91 . GSEA highlighted significant (p Interpretation SNAP91 encodes the clathrin-associated protein AP180 that transports the EGF receptor (EGFR) and is downregulated because of SNAP91 promoter hypermethylation in around 60% of the colorectal cancers without KRAS mutations, potentially causing a failure of endocytosis thereby leading to dysregulated EGF signalling. Failure of endocytosis of the EGFR could lead to resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in wild-type tumours. We are now validating these findings with surface receptor imaging of a SNAP91/AP180 knockout cell line model.

07410fb46054927f6868f36e17845c54ff67e527,De novo assembly of the Japanese lawngrass (Zoysia japonica Steud.) root transcriptome and identification of candidate unigenes related to early responses under salt stress,"Japanese lawngrass (Zoysia japonica Steud.) is an important warm-season turfgrass that is able to survive in a range of soils, from infertile sands to clays, and to grow well under saline conditions. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in its resistance to salt stress. Here, we used high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the changes in gene expression of Zoysia grass at high NaCl concentrations. We first constructed two sequencing libraries, including control and NaCl-treated samples, and sequenced them using the Illumina HiSeqâ„¢ 2000 platform. Approximately 157.20 million paired-end reads with a total length of 68.68 Mb were obtained. Subsequently, 100,800 unigenes with an N50 length of 1104 bp were assembled using Trinity, among which 70,127 unigenes were functionally annotated (E â‰¤ 10(-5)) in the non-redundant protein (NR) database. Furthermore, three public databases, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Swiss-prot, and Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs), were used for gene function analysis and enrichment. The annotated genes included 46 Gene Ontology (GO) terms, 120 KEGG pathways, and 25 COGs. Compared with the control, 6035 genes were significantly different (false discovery rate â‰¤0.01, |log2Ratio|â‰¥1) in the NaCl-treated samples.

e5a84f4f0dbf6a5235ba7b9feda5dcde2977345e,Epigenetics and early domestication: differences in hypothalamic DNA methylation between red junglefowl divergently selected for high or low fear of humans,"BackgroundDomestication of animals leads to large phenotypic alterations within a short evolutionary time-period. Such alterations are caused by genomic variations, yet the prevalence of modified traits is higher than expected if they were caused only by classical genetics and mutations. Epigenetic mechanisms may also be important in driving domesticated phenotypes such as behavior traits. Gene expression can be modulated epigenetically by mechanisms such as DNA methylation, resulting in modifications that are not only variable and susceptible to environmental stimuli, but also sometimes transgenerationally stable. To study such mechanisms in early domestication, we used as model two selected lines of red junglefowl (ancestors of modern chickens) that were bred for either high or low fear of humans over five generations, and investigated differences in hypothalamic DNA methylation between the two populations.ResultsTwenty-two 1-kb windows were differentially methylated between the two selected lines at pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 after false discovery rate correction. The annotated functions of the genes within these windows indicated epigenetic regulation of metabolic and signaling pathways, which agrees with the changes in gene expression that were previously reported for the same tissue and animals.ConclusionsOur results show that selection for an important domestication-related behavioral trait such as tameness can cause divergent epigenetic patterns within only five generations, and that these changes could have an important role in chicken domestication.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Johan BÃ©lteky"", ids = ""4438383""); list(name = ""Beatrix Agnvall"", ids = ""3932238""); list(name = ""Lejla Bektic"", ids = ""8862570""); list(name = ""Andrey HÃ¶glund"", ids = ""40569948""); list(name = ""Per Jensen"", ids = ""48540818""); list(name = ""Carlos Guerrero-Bosagna"", ids = ""1398170039"")",43f751ae268940641806bcae1d8eca6aeab12ceb; 9c0cf407631e0b36b863ffab42c7e654d78f86c8; 7508b7c6154debdb0e0ffa81b5ffcc1ffbfe69f3; 703ea0de89692368978c4ca90c68e3f49655f87a,00f61434b5d1f5ba4fd4d469726c58b559552dc8; 071d8e3bb30ddcde85b22c93d331bc2d9a960b97; 78ea3186b71c5cc3d9abfe150d1a56d245ed5d0a; b33005a271da008bfa6ea0a0188d96802af7efc2; faba72e01626a3e78ac582acaece2d91ed0f94c0; 399f6f25f8baa12e36ed47807bea5142ea3f9a52; fd8d9ae53640c194e6e5c7bd7c6ff18a686d963d; 6aaff36bb84708179876cefcc11f1b1210f70fb1; 26b13760cbba2c42ed3e86bab5739e04cfbe6a91; f4419eb0a4e81351af1e176e2233b1bad2856eb3; 2e286845330b2fc6a5663b0922d425752576a0da; 2819d383c3d42cdfa66a3e1dcc5924ff906643cd; b369322e09d67961cbe163a3bf4a8caa2049fb2d; 79651e7934e31c4715a81e4fa1becf4f5c650845; 98889170cd5c0bf7e8173415c33f06cfd90f5d51; cc9aca27f1985b0ae26947e246292f9a150d64e8; 13d1b3e84778bc40c26970c2f464ab7c55bf7c49; a5652b598cb0f37a15f8182577fb9c9747cf5358; 4abf9e9dcf74c525ba800f6c9f1a189e1eb6e288; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; e2ea17406db4790516349597e88968d1b13818d5; 0a22d4c0645e2fa912d59f48a4c9da32c3aef0a5; 7f8b4654298b36832cd9d5e8e78c7605f60cec31; 4e1991d7625e752ef9f5f5af5c3112ac395ffa45; e22f7ab9e533a2951cba02f318ae9b76c8051572; f699a8e235c552a179d7634871db747dc9f8b852; 90e8ce15cbf6c5714ea4eb09c3d9d32f2c226745; b4f249781ae06568c7e1d41c357c27a78f5d2dbc; 2a2aacd3db4ca23f5c643c6c99e4158682f0f804; 79813b6145fba2e684bc51a7075a1bb597dbe474; ac2d5ac5c6f0d8498439a54d3d2f891965865b9f; 2a1ff511b583862769cae7c018e0a9582ee76418; 78c05f00a344337343443fffbf8527c2679bc47d; 65d6e8d69c657528b0c50bacddbf6747935865f1; c42c1891cd7e0283f7c5f061e50bb85c7dc2aa6e; 0a2d5238c574a62d9f547135e95effaae11519c7; dd833d84dc4ee2e90477a8d6559235519555a06e; 2d0d980fd7e15ce884f67226d9b4c3d62400cef4; f254c8a064e3c0a547873b25255a33033965482d; e3411f82433f5578bfea0eeedfb6f9ca28cd107f; ceb9f5673b697c65e331ff58e5b27af251a8dfa8; a1afea9c1224a61ff8abcd6198615ea8097b95b2; e826143147eb6e4eaa858093bbc20604284dba8d; 3de202b513aed19efeebcc95f0d3108408e0d177; 750f63b7a8d29f7c9da2e6c78dfbf22a37415b56; a4527ea927b11bcdf0e7ee4ab6601ef36b0eefea; 0a3e562e78800dbf6164370b54a28629ada46fc4; 91365f24b2a1fa90abc6bfc5cc02cc5595379204; ebe63ce991731cef681c6158ad83aa0f6f9339d2; 736aff18fd7f064af1d16aefd70d2c041e7595a1; 0cbf9d39b4a3b370514cb4c2db06059af860f7c7; db3294c991b47c70ba79ba9b6d18698770e45646; 793e8c587af5b5e29af03a8eee2c37f313083bd7; d53f0da47274cfefeab30d58941d7cec68a2b3c2; da87da7e6711b279b1d31c4768e1b549769dfcf3; 4e095ecec3eae31cb1b7e28190563412a30bcf2d; 2633ae47e9f45f1ddd9933231cdaacd1d1d442a7; b01c3bfe542383ed3aab1c024919805f088cb282,"Genetics, Selection, Evolution : GSE",50,
87a5679b7c7b7b896b37eeaa7c2566753faba76c,Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics Analyses Using the OpenProt Database to Unveil Novel Proteins Translated from Non-Canonical Open Reading Frames.,"Genome annotation is central to today's proteomic research as it draws the outlines of the proteomic landscape. Traditional models of open reading frame (ORF) annotation impose two arbitrary criteria: a minimum length of 100 codons and a single ORF per transcript. However, a growing number of studies report expression of proteins from allegedly non-coding regions, challenging the accuracy of current genome annotations. These novel proteins were found encoded either within non-coding RNAs, 5' or 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, or overlapping a known coding sequence (CDS) in an alternative ORF. OpenProt is the first database that enforces a polycistronic model for eukaryotic genomes, allowing annotation of multiple ORFs per transcript. OpenProt is freely accessible and offers custom downloads of protein sequences across 10 species. Using OpenProt database for proteomic experiments enables novel proteins discovery and highlights the polycistronic nature of eukaryotic genes. The size of OpenProt database (all predicted proteins) is substantial and need be taken in account for the analysis. However, with appropriate false discovery rate (FDR) settings or the use of a restricted OpenProt database, users will gain a more realistic view of the proteomic landscape. Overall, OpenProt is a freely available tool that will foster proteomic discoveries.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Marie A.

b8cf5721c4da2447a1d003dc7f5a35cb0e805c09,Effects of in-utero exposure to chemotherapy on fetal brain growth.,"OBJECTIVE
Children exposed to chemotherapy in the prenatal period demonstrate normal neurocognitive development at 3 years but concerns regarding fetal brain growth remain high considering its vulnerability to external stimuli. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of in-utero chemotherapy exposure on brain growth and its effects on neurodevelopmental outcome.


METHODS
The protocol was approved by the local ethics committee. Brain regional volumes at term postmenstrual age were measured by MRI in children exposed to in-utero chemotherapy and compared with normal MRI controls. Brain segmentation was performed by Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs)-based transformations of the Neonatal Brain Atlas (ALBERT). Neurodevelopmental assessment (Bayley-III scales) was performed at 18 months corrected age in both exposed infants and in a group of healthy controls. Multiple linear regressions and false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons were performed.


RESULTS
Twenty-one newborns prenatally exposed to chemotherapy (epirubicin administered in 81% of mothers) were enrolled in the study: the mean gestational age was 36.4Â±2.4 weeks and the mean birthweight was 2,753Â±622â€‰g. Brain MRI was performed at mean postmenstrual age of 41.1Â±1.4 weeks. No statistically significant differences were identified between the children exposed to chemotherapy and controls in both the total (398Â±55â€‰cm3 vs 427Â±56â€‰cm3, respectively) and regional brain volumes. Exposed children showed normal Bayley-III scores (cognitive 110.2Â±14.5, language 99.1Â±11.3,â€‰and motor 102.6Â±7.3), and no significant correlation was identified between the brain volumes and neurodevelopmental outcome.


CONCLUSION
Prenatal exposure to anthracycline/cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy does not impact fetal brain growth, thus supporting the idea that oncological treatment in pregnant women seems to be feasible and safe for the fetus.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sofia Passera"", ids = ""6612591""); list(name = ""V E Contarino"", ids = ""5017589""); list(name = ""Giovanna Scarfone"", ids = ""6585626""); list(name = ""Elisa Scola"", ids = ""6448329""); list(name = ""Camilla Fontana"", ids = ""151470392""); list(name = ""Fedro Alessandro Peccatori"", ids = ""4391425""); list(name = ""Claudia Maria Cinnante"", ids = ""4633205""); list(name = ""Serena J.

Merging highly correlated hitchhiker SNPs into haplotype blocks, reduces thousands of candidates to few selected regions. Current methods of haplotype reconstruction from Pool-Seq data time series data require a variety of data-specific parameters that are typically defined ad hoc and require haplotype sequences for validation. Here, we introduce haplovalidate, a tool which detects selected haplotypes in a broad range of Pool-Seq time series data without the need of sequenced haplotypes. Haplovalidate makes data-driven choices of two key para-meters for the clustering procedure, the minimum correlation between SNPs constituting a cluster and the window size. Applying haplovalidate to simulated and experimental E&R data reliably detects selected haplotype blocks with low false discovery rates - independent of few or many selection targets are included. Our analyses identified an important restriction of the haplotype block-based approach to describe the genomic architecture of adaptation. We detected a substantial fraction of haplotypes containing multiple selection targets. These blocks were considered as one region of selection and therefore led to under-estimation of the number of selection targets. We demonstrate that the separate analysis of earlier time points can significantly increase the separation of selection targets into individual haplotype blocks. We conclude that the analysis of selected haplotype blocks has a large potential for the characterisation of the adaptive architecture with E&R experiments.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Kathrin Anna Otte"", ids = ""49418796""); list(name = ""Christian SchlÃ¶tterer"", ids = ""2967138"")",,91c4a5092c2ed04924006f51b9c395934f5cf419; 79ccdbd1c0a619c98dc7e7555c5dcdd49dc39dc2; 9f00e96eba31673cefdcc793487ba628ae5f4cc2; 8e3a260f351dc38f1651b7bf911f28ed2c2c8e65; 0bfe13f43b483d72436c341b9bd37c0696c51604; 9f73e6bf4865757a853c3eb30b4efa03392c53c2; d884379452904977520861d71178140701b176ce; 2c0d4ca310295505fbc65bcbe0c705a98a1d7e71; ed3a728a7c53d788d319962159c841f1d637de57; b34568fa282ae1e5f6fee75660f5af7733e832c7; ceab453ab15247f1e87525c5abc9a9440ab36b7b; 8987ad0a55a3d7cedaa6b623cbc6386402270bcd; 26798d46f020ea35166b9e7dde846c099a0cad62; 3921c538c55ea856be49ff2ae27797937acc2789; d3a603ea9664d3dc8911875e16d1fd22e46cd10b; 60c538e1521cee63754ad10363a462fbad8156b1; 1b026b2c3a5d6a9d2a52b35b0c72a7f2d41068cf; 011007ac2f7d87e2b9457ab8b56ed0abb2c52934; 62bfa76ea9cc7c125072b2cc0f406da69c5f3adf; 8b2ce5c42c04d9b7126e5df81545672fb4c48e05; 99770b9e3abcf6bd188b19b7cf39a46f27845c18; 0426fc49f9e936e261423aa2a583cebe12bb4097; f36992fb8323ccd73b52eb168cda1c81cf880f76; ad809d9d73f20944e9569421511c355e386e1e15; 6e7b1148733778d05c8768ab81aadf46e8b907b8; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 0bbf1f32058d81f8684a8738aecf7158257df620; d69303806f18fcf9ab60bba0ffd85e1d78cb883e; 795883331fe7a3fcc46be311a1be14130cb3df6e; 086818b7053e8c3cf96561c05f5762b9e3feb21d; 1a7494ddbc506ca20a17644c0595b4718b919d58; bd388b996f8691867ff56b174427eece14f46235,bioRxiv,,

We sought to model chronic radiation-associated dysphagia (RAD) in patients given intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) as a function of age and dose to non-target swallowing muscles.


Methods
We reviewed 300 patients with T1-T4â€¯N0-3â€¯M0 OPSCC given definitive IMRT with concurrent chemotherapy. Chronic RAD was defined as aspiration or stricture on videoflouroscopy/endoscopy, gastrostomy tube, or aspiration pneumonia at â‰¥12â€¯months after IMRT. Doses to autosegmented regions of interest (ROIs; inferior, middle and superior constrictors, anterior and posterior digastrics, mylo/geniohyoid complex, intrinsic tongue, and gengioglossus) were obtained from DICOM-RT plans and dose-volume histograms. The probability of chronic RAD as a function of mean ROI dose, stratified by age (<50, 50-59, 60-69, or â‰¥70â€¯years), was estimated with logistic probability models and subsequent unsupervised nonlinear curves.


Results
Chronic RAD was observed in 34 patients (11%). Age was a significant correlate of chronic RAD, both independently and with dose for all muscle groups examined. Distinct muscle-specific dose-response profiles were observed as a function of age (e.g., 5% of patients in their 50â€¯s [but 20% of those 70â€¯+â€¯] who received 60â€¯Gy to the superior constrictor had chronic RAD). This effect was stable across all observed muscle ROIs, with a false discovery rate-corrected pâ€¯<â€¯0.05, for all dose/muscle/age models, suggesting that including age as a covariate improves modeling of chronic RAD.


Conclusions
Age at treatment moderates the probability of chronic RAD after chemo-IMRT for OPSCC, with aging muscles showing lower dose thresholds. Uniform dose constraints may not predict toxicity in older patients.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kaitlin M. Alokananda Abdallah Sherif Radwan Mona G.

d6c2bb5976d9ceb96f2c7f16c36ac3f85cc7b9e1,Genetic variation in inflammatory pathways is related to colorectal cancer survival.,"PURPOSE
Prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with systemic inflammation, and anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce both CRC incidence and mortality. Genetic variation in proinflammatory pathways can affect an individual's CRC risk. However, few studies have investigated the prognostic importance of this genetic variation in CRC patients.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We investigated the association between CRC survival and genetic variation in proinflammatory pathways among patients from the Puget Sound Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in five genes (PTGS-1, PTGS-2, MRP4, NFÎºB, and IÎºBKÎ²). Vital status was ascertained through linkage to the National Death Index. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The false discovery rate method of Benjamini and Hochberg was applied to address multiple testing.


RESULTS
Four PTGS-1 variants were associated with CRC survival. One, G>A intron 9 (rs1213266), was associated with approximately 50% lower CRC mortality (HR(AA/AG vs. GG) = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25-0.93). Three variants, including L237M, resulted in significantly elevated CRC mortality risk, with HRs ranging from approximately 1.5 to 2.0. Two variants in IÎºBKÎ², including R526Q, were significantly associated with CRC survival. Correction for multiple testing indicated that variants in both PTGS-1 and IÎºBKÎ² are reproducibly associated with CRC survival.


CONCLUSION
Our findings suggest that genetic variation in proinflammatory pathways may be important for CRC prognosis. This investigation represents one of the first descriptions of the relationship between inherited polymorphisms and mortality in CRC patients and provides a starting point for further research.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Anna E Coghill"", ids = ""3739987""); list(name = ""Polly A Newcomb"", ids = ""4295175""); list(name = ""Elizabeth M Poole"", ids = ""144781311""); list(name = ""Carolyn M.

0b8ba160e1a49c0b437bd962368d46e1718bf2e5,Response of skeletal muscle UCP2-expression during metabolic adaptation to caloric restriction,"Background/objectivesSpendthrift vs. thrifty individuals expend more energy and experience greater weight loss during caloric restriction (CR). Adaptive mechanisms in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and on hormone level modulate energy expenditure (EE) during weight loss. Metabolic mechanisms underlying the variability in EE during CR are unclear. The present study explored whether during long-term CR (i) gene expression changes in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue relate with the individual EE response and weight loss, and (ii) altered catecholamine and FGF21-concentrations are associated with measures of metabolic adaptation.Subjects/methodsIn a 10-week inpatient study, 24-h EE was measured before and after 6 weeks of 50% CR in 12 subjects using whole-room indirect calorimetry. Weight loss was assessed and repeated hormone measurements performed. Muscle and adipose tissue biopsies were taken before and after CR, and gene expression was assessed (RNA-Seq). Genes showing the most significant changes after CR were tested for association with EE and followed-up for further association with metabolic measures in a separate phenotyping study (nâ€‰=â€‰103).ResultsMuscle UCP2 showed the strongest change after CR (log2-fold changeâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’1.57, false discovery rateâ€‰=â€‰0.10) and was considered the best gene for exploration of metabolic adaptive processes. A greater decrease in UCP2-expression was associated with less weight loss (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03, râ€‰=â€‰0.77) and relatively lower 24-h EE after CR (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001, râ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.96). Post-CR changes in FGF21-plasma concentrations correlated with UCP2-expression change (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02, râ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.89) and weight loss (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.003, râ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.83). In a separate metabolic phenotyping study, muscle UCP2-expression correlated with respiratory quotient and macronutrient oxidation. In adipose tissue, no candidate genes for metabolic exploration were found.ConclusionsChanges in muscle UCP2-expression reflect an inter-individual metabolic response to long-term CR and may influence EE and weight loss via modulation of substrate oxidation.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sascha Heinitz"", ids = ""40570486""); list(name = ""Paolo Piaggi"", ids = ""1936069""); list(name = ""Shanshan Yang"", ids = ""2486905""); list(name = ""Susan M Bonfiglio"", ids = ""5239385""); list(name = ""Jason Steel"", ids = ""48661082""); list(name = ""Jonathan Krakoff"", ids = ""2662033""); list(name = ""Susanne B.

bd94a6c7920e8228fa8b48b88426ce202b73bac8,Abstract 4800: Quantitative detection of discriminatory proteins in tissue and serum of ovarian cancer patients by LC-MSE,"Proceedings: AACR 103rd Annual Meeting 2012â€â€ Mar 31â€Apr 4, 2012; Chicago, IL

Purpose: Using label-free UPLC-MSE quantification methods to identifying proteins as well as determining their abundance in serum and microdissected ovarian cancer tissue. Experimental procedures: Serum of six patients with a serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary (stage IIIB or higher) was collected before treatment. Matched control patients with a serous cystadenoma of the ovary were chosen as a control group. In addition, homogeneous regions of cells that exhibited uniform histology were isolated from cancer tissue by laser capture microdissection (LCM), normal ovarian epithelial cell samples and stroma samples were taken from matched controls. We subsequently employed label-free ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MSE) to identify proteins and determine their absolute concentrations in serum and tissue lysates. Moderated t-tests were used to identify differentially expressed proteins between patient- and control-group. p-values were adjusted for multiple-testing using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rates and considered differentially expressed when <0.05. Summary of the data: In the serum specimens, 13 differentially expressed proteins were identified by LC-MSE profiling. Proteins with different concentrations in patients versus control sera include abundant serum proteins such as apolipoprotein AI and transferrin, both exhibited a lower concentration in serum of cancer patients. Differential expression was also observed for apolipoproteins (APOA IV, APOA II and APOC III) and other proteins that have not been associated with ovarian cancer previously such as C9 and Afamin. In the tissue-lysates we identified 535 Proteins of which 332 could be reliably quantified. Of these 56 were differentially expressed proteins of which 12 had non-overlapping standard deviations. Literature searches confirmed a link between ovarian cancer and 6 of these proteins, suggesting a possible role in disease progression. Of special interest was the identification of prohibitin (PHB) and cofilin-1 (CFL1). Immunohistochemical detection of CFL1 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of our patient group showed heterogeneous expression in 50% of the serous ovarian carcinomas, whereas all the benign lesions were negative. These results again demonstrate the validity of the protein quantitation results obtained by MSE. Interestingly, no overlap was found between the discriminatory proteins in serum specimens and corresponding tissue lysates, illustrating the challenge to identify a single biomarker in the circulation reflecting ovary cancer. Conclusions: Our study revealed several protein changes in serum and tissue of patients suffering from serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary. Further investigation of these proteins is warranted to establish whether they could provide new insights into disease etiology and act as potential new markers.

This research proposes a methodology that aims to determine the impact of accumulated general aviation aircraft interior noise on pilot performance in laboratory conditions. The assessment of the aircraft interior noise influence on Temporary Threshold Shift is integrated as well, enabling extended research of all aspects of the physiological noise impact on pilots. Methodology defines measurable noise and pilot performance parameters in general aviation, equipment requirements, necessary laboratory conditions and subject selection criteria. The analysis of the deviation from the specified flight parameters along with Temporary Threshold Shift values at different accumulated noise doses is carried out. Data is analyzed using descriptive statistics, visualization methods and linear mixed effects models with False Discovery Rate as the method for correction for multiple testing which allows the determination of the potential population effect.",2016,Engineering,"list(name = ""Jurica IvoÅ¡eviÄ‡"", ids = ""81728698""); list(name = ""Tino Bucak"", ids = ""72646995""); list(name = ""Davor Sumpor"", ids = ""98787244"")",,e9537a7e3c416d44bcc0fdd1f39fc6db38fc2d55; f9494c90f611b7b732511ceedbac12e8f5f033b1; 3a72a48f9ff14df7628b9dd20385ec129a10456e; 142827930d56115387019a279fbc37e378650cf3; 2d26d233f86d4ba8c1e77406e7addcc076e978b5; 53bedd518619201987e240b50cd826436ce3d78d; a6dc6c92e280fad3ebf177aac592d33ef6898db3,Promet-traffic & Transportation,28,487-496
e2b35c55ec9c40b628b2d4bd82dd908d4a5916f4,"Multiple Testing and False Discovery Rate Control: Theory, Methods and Algorithms","Author(s): Chen, Shiyun | Advisor(s): Arias-Castro, Ery | Abstract: Multiple testing, a situation where multiple hypothesis tests are performed simultaneously, is a core research topic in statistics that arises in almost every scientific field. When more hypotheses are tested, more errors are bound to occur. Controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) [BH95], which is the expected proportion of falsely rejected null hypotheses among all rejections, is an important challenge for making meaningful inferences. Throughout the dissertation, we analyze the asymptotic performance of several FDR-controlling procedures under different multiple testing settings. In Chapter 1, we study the famous Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method [BH95] which often serves as benchmark among FDR-controlling procedures, and show that it is asymptotic optimal in a stylized setting. We then prove that a distribution-free FDR control method of Barber and Cand`es [FBC15], which only requires the (unknown) null distribution to be symmetric, can achieve the same asymptotic performance as the BH method, thus is also optimal. Chapter 2 proposes an interval-type procedure which identifies the longest interval with the estimated FDR under a given level and rejects the corresponding hypotheses with P-values lying inside the interval. Unlike the threshold approaches, this procedure scans over all intervals with the left point not necessary being zero. We show that this scan procedure provides strong control of the asymptotic false discovery rate. In addition, we investigate its asymptotic false non-discovery rate (FNR), deriving conditions under which it outperforms the BH procedure. In Chapter 3, we consider an online multiple testing problem where the hypotheses arrive sequentially in a stream, and investigate two procedures proposed by Javanmard and Montanari [JM15] which control FDR in an online manner. We quantify their asymptotic performance in the same location models as in Chapter 1 and compare their power with the (static) BH method. In Chapter 4, we propose a new class of powerful online testing procedures which incorporates the available contextual information, and prove that any rule in this class controls the online FDR under some standard assumptions. We also derive a practical algorithm that can make more empirical discoveries in an online fashion, compared to the state-of-the-art procedures.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Shiyun Chen"", ids = ""3391923"")",,,,,

While solving such problems, it is observed that traditional approaches such as the Lasso select a high number of false positives, which increase with higher noise and correlation levels in the dataset. Stability selection is a procedure which uses randomization with the Lasso to reduce the number of false positives. It is known that concave regularizers such as the minimax concave penalty (MCP) have a higher resistance to false positives than the Lasso in the presence of such noise and correlation. The benefits with respect to false positive control for developing an approach integrating stability selection with concave regularizers has not been studied in the literature so far. This motivates us to develop a novel upper bound on false discovery rate control obtained through this stability selection with minimax concave penalty approach.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Bhanukiran Vinzamuri"", ids = ""3236313""); list(name = ""Kush R.

The greatest change in mononuclear cell gene expression occurred at 6 h (439 induced and 428 repressed genes, 1% false discovery rate, and 50% fold change) including increased expression of genes associated with pathogen recognition molecules and signaling cascades linked to receptors associated with cell mobility and activation. Induced defense response genes included cytokines, chemokines, and their respective receptors, acute-phase transcription factors, proteases, arachidonate metabolites, and oxidases. Repressed defense response genes included those associated with co-stimulatory molecules, T and cytotoxic lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and protein synthesis. Gene expression profiles of whole blood had similar biological themes. Over 100 genes not typically associated with acute inflammation were differentially regulated after endotoxin. By 24 h, gene expression had returned to baseline values. Thus the inflammatory response of circulating leukocytes to endotoxin in humans is characterized by a rapid amplification and subsidence of gene expression. These results indicate that a single intravascular exposure to endotoxin produces a large but temporally short perturbation of the blood transcriptome.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shefali Talwar"", ids = ""46339921""); list(name = ""Peter J.

395736e43dec0d6e9927ff4c104d1bb19ef0841f,FUNC: a package for detecting significant associations between gene sets and ontological annotations,"BackgroundGenome-wide expression, sequence and association studies typically yield large sets of gene candidates, which must then be further analysed and interpreted. Information about these genes is increasingly being captured and organized in ontologies, such as the Gene Ontology. Relationships between the gene sets identified by experimental methods and biological knowledge can be made explicit and used in the interpretation of results. However, it is often difficult to assess the statistical significance of such analyses since many inter-dependent categories are tested simultaneously.ResultsWe developed the program package FUNC that includes and expands on currently available methods to identify significant associations between gene sets and ontological annotations. Implemented are several tests in particular well suited for genome wide sequence comparisons, estimates of the family-wise error rate, the false discovery rate, a sensitive estimator of the global significance of the results and an algorithm to reduce the complexity of the results.ConclusionFUNC is a versatile and useful tool for the analysis of genome-wide data.

Given the complex relationship between clinical risk factors and non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) outcomes, understanding the relationship of miRs and high-risk factors may help dissect independent versus mediating effects of miRs on NSTE-ACS outcomes. Hypothesis: There are associations between specific circulating miRs and established clinical risk factors in patients with NSTE-ACS. Methods: Whole-genome miR sequencing was performed on total RNA extracted from whole blood of 199 patients with NSTE-ACS from the TRILOGY-ACS trial with similar baseline characteristics. Generalized linear models were used to test associations between 247 identified miRs and 13 high-risk factors CVD risk factors including atrial fibrillation (AF), Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score on presentation and chronic heart failure (HF). A false discovery rate of 0.05 was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Results: Overall, 205 risk factor-miR associations were nominally significant (p Conclusions: We identified circulating miRs with expression patterns associated with high-risk factors in NSTE-ACS. MiRs 3135b, 126-5p, 142-5p, 144-5p and miR 28-3p are known mediators of CV development or disease, suggesting their potential role in modulating genomic risk in NSTE-ACS. These miRs may serve as prognostic biomarkers for risk stratification to better predict poor outcomes in patients with NSTE-ACS.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alice Wang"", ids = ""46991229""); list(name = ""Lydia Coulter-Kwee"", ids = ""1435071354""); list(name = ""Elizabeth A Grass"", ids = ""39198197""); list(name = ""Simon G.

960141fd7d906a24ab06288863aef7714c9c5dcb,De novo sequencing of unique sequence tags for discovery of post-translational modifications of proteins.,"De novo sequencing is a spectrum analysis approach for mass spectrometry data to discover post-translational modifications in proteins; however, such an approach is still in its infancy and is still not widely applied to proteomic practices due to its limited reliability. In this work, we describe a de novo sequencing approach for the discovery of protein modifications based on identification of the proteome UStags (Shen, Y.; ToliÄ‡, N.; Hixson, K. K.; Purvine, S. O.; Pasa-ToliÄ‡, L.; Qian, W. J.; Adkins, J. N.; Moore, R. J.; Smith, R. D. Anal. Chem. 2008, 80, 1871-1882). The de novo information was obtained from Fourier-transform tandem mass spectrometry data for peptides and polypeptides from a yeast lysate, and the de novo sequences obtained were selected based on filter levels designed to provide a limited yet high quality subset of UStags. The DNA-predicted database protein sequences were then compared to the UStags, and the differences observed across or in the UStags (i.e., the UStags' prefix and suffix sequences and the UStags themselves) were used to infer possible sequence modifications. With this de novo-UStag approach, we uncovered some unexpected variances within several yeast protein sequences due to amino acid mutations and/or multiple modifications to the predicted protein sequences. To determine false discovery rates, two random (false) databases were independently used for sequence matching, and ~3% false discovery rates were estimated for the de novo-UStag approach. The factors affecting the reliability (e.g., existence of de novo sequencing noise residues and redundant sequences) and the sensitivity of the approach were investigated and described. The combined de novo-UStag approach complements the UStag method previously reported by enabling the discovery of new protein modifications.",2008,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Yufeng Shen"", ids = ""37082667""); list(name = ""Nikola ToliÄ‡"", ids = ""2429166""); list(name = ""Kim K Hixson"", ids = ""5111455""); list(name = ""Samuel Owen Purvine"", ids = ""3036325""); list(name = ""Gordon A.

78b448b1096faa0815944f10cdf034433e90f0b3,Stepdown Procedures Controlling A Generalized False Discovery Rate,"Often in practice when a large number of hypotheses are simultaneously tested, one is willing to allow a few false rejections, say at most ki1, for some flxed k > 1. In such a case, the ability of a procedure controlling an error rate measuring at least one false rejection can potentially be improved in terms of its ability to detect false null hypotheses by generalizing this error rate to one that measures at least k false rejections and using procedures that control it. The k-FDR which is the expected proportion of k or more false rejections and a natural generalization of the false discovery rate (FDR) is such a generalized notion of error rate that has recently been introduced and procedures controlling it have been proposed.

d90fdaea593ce7ec37527d8aab72606abadcda49,Glutamate Networks Implicate Cognitive Impairments in Schizophrenia: Genome-Wide Association Studies of 52 Cognitive Phenotypes,"Cognitive impairments are a core feature in patients with schizophrenia. These deficits could serve as effective tools for understanding the genetic architecture of schizophrenia. This study investigated whether genetic variants associated with cognitive impairments aggregate in functional gene networks related to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Here, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of a range of cognitive phenotypes relevant to schizophrenia were performed in 411 healthy subjects. We attempted to replicate the GWAS data using 257 patients with schizophrenia and performed a meta-analysis of the GWAS findings and the replicated results. Because gene networks, rather than a single gene or genetic variant, may be strongly associated with the susceptibility to schizophrenia and cognitive impairments, gene-network analysis for genes in close proximity to the replicated variants was performed. We observed nominal associations between 3054 variants and cognitive phenotypes at a threshold of P < 1.0 Ã— 10(-) (4). Of the 3054 variants, the associations of 191 variants were replicated in the replication samples (P < .05). However, no variants achieved genome-wide significance in a meta-analysis (P > 5.0 Ã— 10(-) (8)). Additionally, 115 of 191 replicated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have genes located within 10 kb of the SNPs (60.2%). These variants were moderately associated with cognitive phenotypes that ranged from P = 2.50 Ã— 10(-) (5) to P = 9.40 Ã— 10(-) (8). The genes located within 10 kb from the replicated SNPs were significantly grouped in terms of glutamate receptor activity (false discovery rate (FDR) q = 4.49 Ã— 10(-) (17)) and the immune system related to major histocompatibility complex class I (FDR q = 8.76 Ã— 10(-) (11)) networks. Our findings demonstrate that genetic variants related to cognitive trait impairment in schizophrenia are involved in the N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate network.",2015,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kazutaka Ohi"", ids = ""144747980""); list(name = ""Ryota Hashimoto"", ids = ""97052153""); list(name = ""Masashi Ikeda"", ids = ""152164041""); list(name = ""Hidenaga Yamamori"", ids = ""1906590""); list(name = ""Yuka Yasuda"", ids = ""48999236""); list(name = ""Michiko Fujimoto"", ids = ""47046467""); list(name = ""Satomi Umeda-Yano"", ids = ""1401440636""); list(name = ""Masaki Fukunaga"", ids = ""47376772""); list(name = ""Haruo Fujino"", ids = ""3771406""); list(name = ""Yoshiyuki Watanabe"", ids = ""145966832""); list(name = ""Masao Iwase"", ids = ""35371218""); list(name = ""Hiroaki Kazui"", ids = ""2851493""); list(name = ""Nakao Iwata"", ids = ""4288013""); list(name = ""Daniel R.

We analyzed the regulatory structure of miRNAs and their colocalized gene targets in EOC tissue to construct a regulatory signature for clinical prognosis. Methods: FFPE blocks of primary EOC tumor tissue with > 80% tumor cells were selected for 20 patients (stage â‰¥ IIc) for whom follow up data was available. Expression levels of mRNA and miRNA were assayed separately. An integrated analysis was performed to identify miRNA/mRNA regulatory clusters. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was carried out on the coexpression of putative miRNA target genes, from the miRTarBase database, with their respective miRNAs, to identify enriched categories for each miRNA. MiRNAs with at least one significantly enriched category from the MSigDB C2 dataset at a false discovery rate of 0.05 were chosen.

ad172ed4778cb98a5b8c63a34c418fef3cd9eace,A multi-treatment experimental system to examine photosynthetic differentiation in the maize leaf,"BackgroundThe establishment of C4 photosynthesis in maize is associated with differential accumulation of gene transcripts and proteins between bundle sheath and mesophyll photosynthetic cell types. We have physically separated photosynthetic cell types in the leaf blade to characterize differences in gene expression by microarray analysis. Additional control treatments were used to account for transcriptional changes induced by cell preparation treatments. To analyse these data, we have developed a statistical model to compare gene expression values derived from multiple, partially confounded, treatment groups.ResultsDifferential gene expression in the leaves of wild-type maize seedlings was characterized using the latest release of a maize long-oligonucleotide microarray produced by the Maize Array Project consortium. The complete data set is available through the project web site. Data is also available at the NCBI GEO website, series record GSE3890. Data was analysed with and without consideration of cell preparation associated stress.ConclusionEmpirical comparison of the two analyses suggested that consideration of stress helped to reduce the false identification of stress responsive transcripts as cell-type enriched. Using our model including a stress term, we identified 8% of features as differentially expressed between bundle sheath and mesophyll cell types under control of false discovery rate of 5%. An estimate of the overall proportion of differentially accumulating transcripts (1-Ï€0) suggested that as many as 18% of the genes may be differentially expressed between B and M.

257b103c169d75ac2b0fba212616c734636c0bfe,Dissociation of connectivity for syntactic irregularity and perceptual ambiguity in musical chord stimuli,"Previously syntactic irregularity has been most studied with chord sequences. However, the same chord may be interpreted as having different harmonic functions, implying perceptual ambiguity. Hence, syntactic irregularity and perceptual ambiguity may be processed simultaneously. We devised 3 different 5-chord sequences in which the ending chord differed with the tonic (T), submediant (SM), and supertonic (ST). In terms of syntactic regularity, T is most regular, ST is most irregular. However, in terms of perceptual ambiguity, the most irregular ST had the salient highest voice. Therefore, the SM was the most ambiguous condition. We investigated how the human brain separates syntactic irregularity and perceptual ambiguity in terms of effective connectivity in bilateral inferior frontal gyri (IFGs) and superior temporal gyri (STGs) with magnetoencephalography in 19 subjects. Correct rate was lower for the most ambiguous chord (SM) (P = 0.020) as expected. Connectivity from the right to the left IFG was enhanced for the most irregular chord (ST) (P = 0.024, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected), whereas connectivity from the right to the left STG was enhanced for the most ambiguous chord (SM) (P < 0.001, FDR corrected). The correct rate was negatively correlated with connectivity in the STG, further reflecting perceptual ambiguity (P = 0.026). We found that syntactic irregularity and perceptual ambiguity in music are dissociated in connectivity between bilateral IFGs and STGs, respectively. Significance Statement We provide the first neurophysiological evidence of the processing of perceptual ambiguity, other than syntactic irregularity, implied in musical chords. We found that the notion of â€œperceptually ambiguityâ€ is applicable to musical chord stimuli different in syntactic irregularity, and that perceptual ambiguity is separate from syntactic irregularity. Our data demonstrate that the brain interprets the three conditions of musical chords as both â€œfrom regular to irregularâ€ and â€œfrom ambiguous to unambiguousâ€ conditions simultaneously. This study is the first to unveil dissociation of connectivity by syntactic irregularity and perceptual ambiguity involved in musical chord stimuli.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Chan Hee Kim"", ids = ""41214230""); list(name = ""Seung-Hyun Jin"", ids = ""66124559""); list(name = ""June Sic Kim"", ids = ""3294545""); list(name = ""Youn Kim"", ids = ""152848469""); list(name = ""Suk Won Yi"", ids = ""117205556""); list(name = ""Chun Kee Chung"", ids = ""144750921"")",,148937f854e2f63f7188e96bc4fdd4b601156c65; 5993e2db86dd93550600b57b7bd24b5e10fe54cf; 37e264d88137433123a1a867126876c3194139dd; dcdbad3b2847053e3d17f894d860b978689f3cb9; 45cd5a4689840b051e4f328ef9eca951fe5d7e14; 7cd0a8238a483161fd1e3a36ea5b0092b71e6d6a; ff6bdb128cb90b7f1e3b2d7386291408fea82a13; 0cb280e8ce060f47c09da55fb67c85ce01499619; 5acc6de1cf332e5c771b349bddcdcf2a817fcbd3; 96f66329de4b69aa0b7320d13460ade10cf1f645; bc827865ede9f3a624e17c4cd76ef98aeeab4d02; a6e3b42039f58828c57fcda5a4c3f34578f91afe; 2ca9877fafa395263de07adba410d9ee80fb2620; cfd3d36aea54c0b1ea34b7e5f1059cb375fb5193; b3520f3a1b595eeba6ae0b4da4ad14a1c6839b6f; 8ec5ff7cb11f2296668c61b527ff0f7efa26ac6b; f6311326493e70ce8d37006cee6687aee33a913c; bc02a2984e6404eeeb3f44f0e5bfefca6e1af0b8; f2255356679d0df454b765425a80dfdb7612ce82; d8540df7b8cf11f736eab0e55fb936e6f036ff80; 9f740345f2f24a865337c7714a69283958b40534; c1b62d5ddc401a60729ef793fdbd23fed9d7bc90; fc29b5330b0ae829e128c35cf73cbef34782e099; 037cbf0f965edb3bd9fafc89c83500a940657794; 7c53b0aa09151ecf6db41ae4aa101eafb44f0a3f; 7381b681167fb0d5fe96046abc8fdb2fcc0366b2; 9d9434de5e733b009810e00b02e47e4fe49b6aed; f4088664bbff3a5ae8e3fd092ece27779b91533b; c407ecf09027afbd98a1ce335b48f81cca523edb; 7bff16f437f6782e52b2a6044a55c2fb42f35a9b; c2ec6a79be86538ca5cd0ef537897a78f7ad543f; 2d01601be0ea38319d427215fd6465dd34f4590e; c9a9d5e9ecea27db906795a6132ffab2c92232f8; 9a749f91f702c35e27dcea624c29e9e5fec5de4a,bioRxiv,,

There were 14 CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes (CSVDw.), 27 without (CSVDwo.), and 34 healthy controls (HC) recruited matched for age, sex, and education to undergo a 3T resting-state functional MR examination. The whole-brain functional connectome was constructed by thresholding the Pearson correlation matrices of 90 brain regions, and the topologic properties were analyzed by using graph theory approaches. Networks were compared between CSVD patients and HC, and associations between network measures and cognitive function were tested.Compared with HC, the functional connectome in CSVDw. patients showed abnormalities at the global level and at the nodal level (Pâ€Š<â€Š.05, false discovery rate corrected). The network-based statistics method identified a significantly altered network consisting 6 nodes and 13 connections. Among all the 13 connections, only two connections had significant correlation with episodic memory (EM) and processing speed (PS) respectively (Pâ€Š<â€Š.05). The CSVDwo. patients showed no significant network alterations relative to controls (Pâ€Š>â€Š.05).The configurations of brain functional connectome in CSVDw. patients were perturbed but not obvious for those without, and correlated with the mild cognitive impairment, especially for EM and PS. This study suggested that lacunes on thalamus played a vital role in mediating the neural functional changes of CSVD patients.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yuanyuan Qin"", ids = ""35558064""); list(name = ""Wenhao Zhu"", ids = ""48506535""); list(name = ""Chengxia Liu"", ids = ""92695134""); list(name = ""Zhenxiong Wang"", ids = ""48708431""); list(name = ""Wenzhen Zhu"", ids = ""1706072"")",fae0d360b8341cdb356fb65c05d36b75967c5cb9,9cd87eb83bc93161b226731116ec105c0a9c7cb5; ccfc10c5ad0e98db91ddcadfe196cc78326a88bb; f1380a852431a11d54646b8cb5cfd0e9c6276cb5; e904681667a1b3ea1b1185ca5dbf9c23272b5081; 361cd5fbe36b991e55dc48ad8a0521b80eb75526; c49604723093f56f8be16d6a31612de343187ec1; 9a41e7d20fed32f9cdbe1ce966dba3c9ec90cac1; 73a356ecc0f9ce2bbe4036076524d00487f74dcc; b55dfb180030e51e280c5660e7351bbaee7d2d19; cf1113fd0ba60d1c3a185a746b74be79cbb3680d; 7a2e013142a6b570521eaa2fefeb62dd321d05ef; 6b53aac5c5b4df6f824f5d0c989b266f0d8534ec; 6406a37256b134f5743f79bfe3aea81ad699d081; 8600a8d8067231b0b854f091b5ffe0eadeeb98e6; f8b174e8f73f5a2f7d52ed93d05ded8ea4ef19bc; a9a4473607a290f49b7b09e7d72d864779381f5b; 9adaaad97cece2f9639b869ad114b2dcf4290f95; d531df940129c6b5cb40f2d4247e3f99883b30f0; 94210ed585b70ea780edac2d4f6aa9b927f34def; 8a900d62c9d92934dcb89fb2cd3658ca7cde81d3; d61031326150ba23f90e6587c13d99188209250e; c5781c5b43d10b415ee8fad29c235eddc3ee95f8; f276505d65ea8348b58c300a0f8996abedf0f3ff; 95eb5bc28d9d1c90e2440a60eb41b3183082eea9; 8ae7373ec40e6befa8c2a88dad8b6e695e64dffd; 51993fc863f935d21e5f3505bd34afb715bb304f,Medicine,98,

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the 8th most common cancer worldwide and the 6th tumor in frequency in Brazil. Most of cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage and despite the improvement of various treatment modalities the overall survival rates still remain low. The aim of this study was to analyze the gene expression profile to identify the genes related to lymph node metastasis in ESCC samples. Genome-wide expression profiling was carried out in total RNA extracted from 17 frozen tissue samples using the Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray 44K following the manufacturer's protocol. Data were extracted and flagged with Feature Extraction and processed using TMEV Software. A supervised hierarchical clustering was performed using the Pearson distance metric. Paired t-test analysis with 1000 permutations was performed to generate a list of differentially expressed genes from the comparison between the different groups. Only genes showing a false discovery rate (Q value) <5% were accepted as differentially expressed. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Software was used to assess the involvement of significantly differentially expressed genes in known pathways and networks. Hierarchical clustering showed two distinct groups according to lymph node metastasis: Group 1 comprised 6 node-negative cases and Group 2 with 11 node-positive cases. The gene expression profiling revealed 338 genes differentially expressed between the two groups, of which 321 showed lower expression and 17 showed a higher expression in cases of Group 2 when compared to those of Group 1. According to IPA analysis five significant networks could be defined comprising the genes differentially expressed between the two groups. The first network with a score of 43 comprised 21 of the differentially expressed genes and was associated to functions as cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, lipid metabolism and molecular transport. The second network (score 22, 13 genes) was related to nucleic acid metabolism, small molecules biochemistry and energy production. The third network (score 21, 14 genes) was associated to cellular signaling, molecular transport and small molecular biochemistry. The network 4 (score of 21, 12 genes) was associated to cancer, DNA replication, recombination and repair and gene expression. The fifth network (score 21, 12 genes) was related to cellular movement, cardiovascular system development and function and neurological disease. In this study, it was detected genes differentially expressed between cases with and without lymph node metastasis involved in important signaling networks that could have an impact on tumor development or progression in ESCC. The identified genes might be useful as a first step to identify molecular markers to predict lymph node metastasis for improved diagnostic and therapeutic modalities in this tumor.

Eight mid-lactation Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4Ã—4 Latin square design with 14-d periods. A 2Ã—2 factorial arrangement was used to determine the effects of water infusion+ad libitum dry matter intake (DMI), water infusion+restricted DMI (50% of previous 5-d average), l-carnitine infusion (20 g/d)+ad libitum DMI, or l-carnitine infusion+restricted DMI. Liver RNA from 7 healthy cows was used for transcriptome profiling using a bovine microarray. An ANOVA with a false discovery rate was used to identify treatment and interaction effects. A substantial transcriptome change was observed only with DMI restriction, resulting in 312 (155 downregulated, 157 upregulated) differentially expressed genes. Quantitative PCR was performed to verify microarray data and measure expression of additional genes not present on the microarray. The quantitative PCR data confirmed the effect of feed restriction but not of l-carnitine treatment. Feed restriction increased expression of GPX3 and of genes associated with gluconeogenesis (PC, PDK4), inflammation (SAA3), and signaling (ADIPOR2). In contrast, feed restriction downregulated BBOX, a key for l-carnitine biosynthesis, and the transcription factor HNF4A. The bioinformatics functional analysis of genes affected by DMI restriction uncovered biosynthesis of cholesterol and energy generation by mitochondrial respiration as the most relevant and inhibited functions. The data also indicated an increase of flux toward gluconeogenesis. We interpreted those results as a likely response of the liver to spare energy and provide glucose for the lactating mammary gland during feed deprivation.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Haji Akbar"", ids = ""152679792""); list(name = ""Massimo Bionaz"", ids = ""50559748""); list(name = ""Dale Bick Carlson"", ids = ""114504081""); list(name = ""Sandra L.

31f43e8735df2c2a63188fb71b5092ec9bb5911d,RSV vs. rhinovirus bronchiolitis: difference in nasal airway microRNA profiles and NFÎºB signaling,"BackgroundAlthough rhinovirus infection is associated with increased risks of acute and chronic respiratory outcomes during childhood compared with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We aimed to determine the differences in nasal airway microRNA profiles and their downstream effects between infants with rhinovirus and RSV bronchiolitis.MethodsAs part of a multicenter cohort study of infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis, we examined nasal samples obtained from 16 infants with rhinovirus and 16 infants with RSV. We tested nasal airway samples using microarrays to profile global microRNA expression and determine the predicted regulation of targeted transcripts. We also measured gene expression and cytokines for NFÎºB pathway components.ResultsBetween the virus groups, 386 microRNAs were differentially expressed (false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05). In infants with rhinovirus, the NFÎºB pathway was highly ranked as a predicted target for these differentially expressed microRNAs compared with RSV. Pathway analysis using measured mRNA expression data validated that rhinovirus infection had upregulation of NFÎºB family (RelA and NFÎºB2) and downregulation of inhibitor ÎºB family. Infants with rhinovirus had higher levels of NFÎºB-induced type-2 cytokines (IL-10 and IL-13; FDR<0.01).ConclusionIn infants with bronchiolitis, rhinovirus and RSV infections had different nasal airway microRNA profiles associated with NFÎºB signaling.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kohei Hasegawa"", ids = ""2136894""); list(name = ""Marcos PÃ©rez-Losada"", ids = ""1401479586""); list(name = ""Claire E.

8d8dd8c4285826aaea92712c91a3b38d38210ace,Sequence count data are poorly fit by the negative binomial distribution.,"Sequence count data are commonly modelled using the negative binomial (NB) distribution. Several empirical studies, however, have demonstrated that methods based on the NB-assumption do not always succeed in controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at its nominal level. In this paper, we propose a dedicated statistical goodness of fit test for the NB distribution in regression models and demonstrate that the NB-assumption is violated in many publicly available RNA-Seq and 16S rRNA microbiome datasets. The zero-inflated NB distribution was not found to give a substantially better fit. We also show that the NB-based tests perform worse on the features for which the NB-assumption was violated than on the features for which no significant deviation was detected. This gives an explanation for the poor behaviour of NB-based tests in many published evaluation studies. We conclude that nonparametric tests should be preferred over parametric methods.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Stijn Hawinkel"", ids = ""26430882""); list(name = ""J C W Rayner"", ids = ""152910048""); list(name = ""Luc Bijnens"", ids = ""3037520""); list(name = ""Olivier Thas"", ids = ""1484044371"")",,,PloS one,15 4,"

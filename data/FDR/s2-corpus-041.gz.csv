fc454e2cbfed6b878014b0c351f6be3dbfbc8b2b,Simultaneous inferences based on empirical Bayes methods and false discovery rates ineQTL data analysis,"BackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic variants associated with complex human diseases, clinical conditions and traits. Genetic mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) is providing us with novel functional effects of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In a classical quantitative trail loci (QTL) mapping problem multiple tests are done to assess whether one trait is associated with a number of loci. In contrast to QTL studies, thousands of traits are measured alongwith thousands of gene expressions in an eQTL study. For such a study, a huge number of tests have to be performed (~106). This extreme multiplicity gives rise to many computational and statistical problems. In this paper we have tried to address these issues using two closely related inferential approaches: an empirical Bayes method that bears the Bayesian flavor without having much a priori knowledge and the frequentist method of false discovery rates. A three-component t-mixture model has been used for the parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) method. Inferences have been obtained using Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either (ECME) algorithm. A simulation study has also been performed and has been compared with a nonparametric empirical Bayes (NPEB) alternative.ResultsThe results show that PEB has an edge over NPEB. The proposed methodology has been applied to human liver cohort (LHC) data. Our method enables to discover more significant SNPs with FDR<10% compared to the previous study done by Yang et al. (Genome Research, 2010).ConclusionsIn contrast to previously available methods based on p-values, the empirical Bayes method uses local false discovery rate (lfdr) as the threshold. This method controls false positive rate.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Arindom Chakraborty"", ids = ""47774642""); list(name = ""Guanglong Jiang"", ids = ""2190079""); list(name = ""Malaz A.

02833f737b82ae08cd3ed04259cd71d63884c0b9,Altered white matter connectivity in patients with schizophrenia: An investigation using public neuroimaging data from SchizConnect,"Several studies have produced extensive evidence on white matter abnormalities in schizophrenia (SZ). However, optimum consistency and reproducibility have not been achieved, and reported low white matter tract integrity in patients with SZ varies between studies. A whole-brain imaging study with a large sample size is needed. This study aimed to investigate white matter integrity in the corpus callosum and connections between regions of interests (ROIs) in the same hemisphere in 122 patients with SZ and 129 healthy controls with public neuroimaging data from SchizConnect. For each diffusion-weighted image (DWI), two-tensor full-brain tractography was performed; DWIs were parcellated by processing and registering T1 images with FreeSurfer and Advanced Normalization Tools. White matter query language was used to extract white matter fiber tracts. We evaluated group differences in means of diffusion measures between the patients and controls, and correlations of diffusion measures with the severity of clinical symptoms and cognitive impairment in the patients using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), a letter-number sequencing (LNS) test, vocabulary test, letter fluency test, category fluency test, and trail-making test, part A. To correct for multiple comparisons, a false discovery rate of q < 0.05 was applied. In patients with SZ, we observed significant radial diffusivity (RD) and trace (TR) increases in left thalamo-occipital tracts and the right uncinate fascicle, and a significant RD increase in the right middle longitudinal fascicle (MDLF) and the right superior longitudinal fascicle ii. Correlations were present between TR of left thalamo-occipital tracts, and the letter fluency test and the LNS test, and RD in the right MDLF and PANSS positive subscale score. However, these correlations were not significant after correction for multiple comparisons. These results indicated widespread white matter fiber tract abnormalities in patients with SZ, contributing to SZ pathophysiology.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sung Woo Joo"", ids = ""10673848""); list(name = ""Woon Yoon"", ids = ""144697818""); list(name = ""Seung-Hyun Shon"", ids = ""7885572""); list(name = ""Harin Kim"", ids = ""32011701""); list(name = ""Saetbyeol Cha"", ids = ""40879338""); list(name = ""Kee Jeong Park"", ids = ""3758460""); list(name = ""Jung Seop Lee"", ids = ""48174789"")",a326da07751c49f725137a53bb331bf4ddf59dc4; 088dc7905162b91b74fbfdd9a41cee54786a8a23,f0daa7bc6054706f1fd8e8376ffee7c3c5790138; 2074eaa52c261c849ba41c4d5d2513297385e689; dd4efc7973dd8e1f4a53f1cb128491790de683f8; f33b7d16660cb3f8d5744974c68d2cf868d80a05; 291c9d66cf886ed27d89dc03d42a4612b66ab007; 4dc64066df43e8c094db8ff1102c6121cc6c6661; fe6cae41ab3b0b9d907818fad024a9903d737342; 5442b4c48603a590de78d971443e23b8d7d48305; bdabb3b56694528994876864862eff969a16a885; f12253a31ab6745f23051fb91921ea78c25b72d1; 9fc5097d6adb85ba61afded40d90a001e3c36c41; ab872d2c1882b302cb20cbd0293d0b14b610f272; d8bc24a48ee486031f16efde97a27c8e6bbdff95; e6b22fe2f71e8d7ed4003714f68e4236ba75bafb; 995b94cb4246172843153414c1e6dc4cb004dbf4; d84dc86bd3a1388bb8059f4e1cc7b54718c428ae; f33950f5e62ac304395ed3370dd14329cb58321f; 979231a80ef3f684fba3f842ac0cfdca3e1703c1; b21f899b1460fc057a65f3cb04d05b4b0ff694ef; ae00434af3be1a498ece59f06649a6556418237b; a439eeca2048a74a8868be1dd862ec3f0ed26f23; 7dcceea21e589408f0c303d0f5922156926b29cb; 60e58e68f28e82c6399f5e5a8cafd9ca5223d752; e185fadb75c5f6321b562d587555a01b0c018efa; 693b301c470b3721221356e7599eea0c0a21d5a2; 90dde8998e856b9b64877ab3be25cfe5b1eae35a; 3a3c75d71503f0889d7df2ac1de1f07a0235f41d; 7ee3ab0c3a6faf60aa70b88b13d3acc1734abcbd; 0f5b87d066a0e5ba6c1acdffc8cdc32b9060d6a4; 9055be8b0b163001ec97aced302a0f66ce3179ad; a95412b907d06cb2b30ec349cdfb7b3d904b5d65; 6cb9391c9a406307fffa06173b13d43675ad45ed; 4c1aebb5d6e8a6c9d9b76d6ac8973f4535970a91; a73024d68f8c38d65edb11fa4ee31b99cd471876; 0b46d1dd451ffe276ecfaf0dfb5166c012a3055e; c46e1f3bd811f67dffaacf133cc8a03ca98025aa; b386b829f5137d86e64c4530a04dd0a868748385; 79944eaa22de1c250dbcf1d56263ec6ccead6fc1; fbed49cc1ddf59f85e89cef49926ed8ade76af67; 42fa533a75edfb6bf565a46f8019ec70ef371841; 72cd2fb01ce7a37629041b5fb9432ebc0e53575d; 8a48b4c104fa4033c171ef9c5dc3fe0608ea7b45; a1ab748411f385dbb21952d519879516474990d7; 05dc821ec2f3747ac1f8376a316271a95a145dab; b0c2e11764940db4248c90bb576863ad5eb6f4b0; e0b09655943ac634bc6d13b475bcbef7bf164b0d; c8bef8f81f2cc753d288100a53369dee81d870c6; 26dae7422e78067ab22ff9eee72db410a740c14a; 160095d5052d6cf89b15e633a138ee157d229351; 0e3a2c0014979ab90270a88724b9a75cc617e47e; a8ac1e3a27c1c8b2bd205c052478ccf9a91100ce; cbb738116e5cc40f652e47653c2c154bf4c0d34a; 22f00620d3f19cf4c2ca6327e1798514abf7e64d; 22accc3ec35d03516e499c141159dddeb64a8862; 207b892455f05431aac74e41d89aa0728d0d1f36; 0c5a4976c54b70936d007629a87c23a84e0de47f; 7e5dd35ca74a4498c882d9402632b4d4d9150986; c1a7df0d1eabdd4060acb535a77f57f713b3d263; 2df567899a170c62c80b0393c0064a627aada609; 185e1dcb631cfa9303af4d539b6d59cf389fb862; f4c7163ea523c8fbb97fcb3700af18ca05bb1ff2; e99a35ceaea106a2457ffa321ee108946e24167a; 187d4e9771d00470939ac3a09517749c1e560957; ce6e9bd5846d16e534896349d94fa470fbecdf69; 52a4448b617614117c73193fce5b1c86db946dcb; 70f10c58a9e15b06fde1078f49d4bdac700e9fa4; 2dd32ff6608812d9b5d3877340df1cf9fceda08f; e4d91d60cc7b3c0a9c646a477495cd4e9d3e4910; f92144dd15c15eeba71cf5529ef055500adccb1c; e5b1b90780706bf928beb5d6bc13b467e9a1c4d0; 2b473368ee54d40e486dadeef17ba40a62fcacea; f263b800a86c137e6b181a6beabf0663864f6e03; 8425be9554c31892a67b69720789065339a4ba2f; 39545eb03cf52cc40066d07b4282f2bcca9067f0; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 8a07d419e07ab67082927668a69c18aa8aeafa99; 8bc4ac4d541b811cc778486fd0afc34ceab37456; 022ec6697194a3152cd8f27f710e3680d6de19b2; 0e7e466b6b93dc84fccc840ca6eeb138a79896e4; bf84d9ca4e7d3c99511872fda6704d00417f4a04; fb2de8b873c88593dd30ebbe4afdd9a97cf73754; ddb5cca479fb7972d6e9155003c9fbc8eee95430; abc440bb787fa90049c5c2ec20b86ab78588a9a1; 7d6365839a069042c79f1cb6471045c61566eaa0; 58961d9e0a6800207ed910688a7de85d922007b6; 9d487eadb24555f0e3bc18a4b4f431a05bcfdf27; 55b4ab7b14a2978daaf2a2a7fc1a3e78ffcfc34e; 2861c24bc829f963a594a5916a9ce9616b6486d7; 0a7bfb62f81ac88c81b19d3039b2859a497b5dbb; 26308da41251b66efdebef454c92add5c361f5db,PLoS ONE,13,

49b230aacb7205717fb8492edb0e1fbdc5264e0d,The chemopreventive effect of taxifolin is exerted through ARE-dependent gene regulation.,"Phase II detoxification enzymes are responsible for the detoxification and elimination of activated carcinogens, and thus act as important biomarkers for chemoprevention. In this study, we tested the chemopreventive activity of taxifolin, a flavanon compound purified from a mongolian medicinal plant, by measuring quinone reductase (QR) activity in HCT 116 cells. Taxifolin induced significant QR activity, but displayed relatively low cytotoxicity in cells (chemoprevention index=5.75). To identify the target genes regulated by taxifolin, DNA microarray was performed with a 3K human cancer chip containing 3096 human genes associated with carcinogenesis. Significant analysis of microarray (SAM) revealed 428 differentially expressed (DE) genes as statistically significant, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 57.2% (delta=0.3366). Sixty-five genes, including a few detoxification enzymes (NQO1, GSTM1) and an antioxidant enzyme (TXNRD1), were up-regulated and 363 genes were down-regulated in the presence of 60 microM taxifolin. In view of the finding that selected genes of interest contained antioxidant response element (ARE), we hypothesize that taxifolin modulates chemopreventive genes through activation of the ARE. Transient transfection experiments using the ARE QR-CAT construct demonstrate that taxifolin significantly activates ARE, but not xenobiotic response element (XRE). In conclusion, taxifolin acts as a potential chemopreventive agent by regulating genes via an ARE-dependent mechanism.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Saet Byoul Lee"", ids = ""3674211""); list(name = ""Kwang Hyun Cha"", ids = ""6235193""); list(name = ""Dangaa Selenge"", ids = ""14804659""); list(name = ""Amgalan Solongo"", ids = ""11994278""); list(name = ""Chu Won Nho"", ids = ""3933790"")",1c26db31d0315e81f6e380cfaa8692d215c5c004; 48c67edb4e8c5ffa92a0b64aef0070c371e8e3f2; 9c6c4b26044085652d0f4a302ed0bed1cf0e87ae; 88347b8d9d27d20d91b2dd56bc1a070acba18b19; ebd534886bd3d0a8f6ddecfc47a3df617f4e5c61; 2a55a9b7f3f7209bc45944efd4f14324e4a73c6f; 49ae0a203a713697790f9b0269895253bd8f6189; 45f72124422b5a2c6c1953305153908c12913e25; 214c82a5f6d5c34b6f8e8fbb0250bf0a1202b435; ca4a5d22500dc3f7796fac40a6fb9f32563253a9; e70743391450fbc1f1d8dc36efbeea25ad225316; ccfa99a360ff95d95a62a5861ff6748713813f4f; c5215e4c98d1cb700853ba1e9af2695d203d128a; 2c3f4251345fef11369052e46bb7181fbfa1b5a3; 89ff8bc1dd39e4fe3c0c6ace07db914bcb481e53; 2fedbbb16eecc66a2df931fd76297b5c825290d2; 81d92a9d234433b14ae3b1fd256df20213313a0f; 2137a515fe5a077fe6a563b6c994febbf826acb0; b48b86d6fcbe70fcf951fc32cdfdc399298196ff; 6d904a06fa58f1e0d01e9caae5780413328ea197; b5c882290976453a18ea7f144ba45f0d8c0d549c; 2e8de4a4003fbbf9c2def46d70cd8f8c37fdd115; 5e82228906381e03c13b27d5eb2e76ea0a6e6620; 768e3ba5108bc3ac53caf2de61bf05d3addf4a0c; e96bdc890d996251ac22cedb4b53c35ac163ec1e; 483b9d8d48cbad2eb40108089c3eebe30929e07c; 8dca995992bd9214c9eebee8f37eb10c21e7c5ad,7073243f44fd64a80dae830817e39fb86a59b303,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,30 6,"

4c41f150652eb93effac5d98c483914eddea51e0,Improving the Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure for Discrete Tests,"To find interesting items in genome-wide association studies or next generation sequencing data, a crucial point is to design powerful false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedures that suitably combine discrete tests (typically binomial or Fisher tests). In particular, recent research has been striving for appropriate modifications of the classical Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) step-up procedure that accommodate discreteness. However, despite an important number of attempts, these procedures did not come with theoretical guarantees. The present paper contributes to fill the gap: it presents new modifications of the BH procedure that incorporate the discrete structure of the data and provably control the FDR for any fixed number of null hypotheses (under independence). Markedly, our FDR controlling methodology allows to incorporate simultaneously the discreteness and the quantity of signal of the data (corresponding therefore to a so-called $\pi_0$-adaptive procedure). The power advantage of the new methods is demonstrated in a numerical experiment and for some appropriate real data sets.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sebastian Dohler"", ids = ""90848108""); list(name = ""Guillermo AndrÃ©s Durand"", ids = ""77212328""); list(name = ""Etienne Roquain"", ids = ""3117456"")",,e5d98e8f6e405c6d98f0d81f92e04cd992ede1b9; d2af3c5b1f34a440baa5974e0546bc8201897fda; 659ba737ff635725e4116ce9ed84035d166c37f7; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 2544949c65e5bf3898df558375b72cda49d83ccc; a1379882981e14a86d5a49925bb38dfd49f817c8; 18f677e5ee3f15a5531f45052a2bc78c15a800a4; 86bb6e673d7573c60cdd97fc2803a8ac41d6d836; d3ab54e250ef51a3c9b6146cd26229275c76d15b; 2eb10c21afa512730aff59844439f4a00aa97877; 622aac02e6f11c70455d517946ced2d9032e5359; 858ebcba255653003d19f6a1b2a6935e9ec78c3d; 263d3e0869a0abf2c45fc00737c790237410f51f; 5c5043e64508f025dc848974dd784330aa8eaae5; 7b84343528ff8aaf4123b460a3464e38b938aeca; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 09f3572aba38c4268720c60fe14d63033bef1956; c4465436014be9baae12aeee01880ff4c9571e8a; d60607f4c936a83d3823d1dd3b575370ff7fbe3c; a97e8af759381536766a5c2dfcb611fa0066c93c; ac7ead7dc5ee1eb47f8596da402db2b28d72a03e,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,

Here we report the highest number of the zebrafish embryo proteins identified so far to our knowledge, through a combination of a protein-level fractionation approach (1D SDS-PAGE) and two different peptide-level fractionation approaches (IEF and strong anion exchange (SAX)) of deyolked zebrafish embryos followed by LC-MS/MS. We detected 5267 proteins in total of which 3464 proteins were identified with at least two peptides (less than 1% peptide false discovery rate). The analysis of proteome coverage from each method showed that 56% of detected proteins were common to all approaches and 95% of the detected proteome was obtained from 1D SDS-PAGE approach alone. Bioinformatics analysis of the detected proteome demonstrated that nucleocytoplasmic transport (biological process) and ribosomal proteins (cellular component) were the most over-represented proteins, whereas cell-cell signaling (biological process) and extracellular space proteins (cellular component) were the most under-represented proteins in the identified proteome.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christopher LÃ¶ÃŸner"", ids = ""47658433""); list(name = ""Sheena Wee"", ids = ""34077211""); list(name = ""Siok Ghee Ler"", ids = ""6251791""); list(name = ""Rachel Li"", ids = ""50392209""); list(name = ""Tom J Carney"", ids = ""5167057""); list(name = ""Walter P.

The AD-associated amyloid-Î² precursor protein-Î± has been shown to be elevated in severe autism, leading to the â€˜anabolic hypothesisâ€™ of its etiology. Here we performed a focused microarray analysis of genes belonging to NOTCH and WNT signaling cascades, as well as genes related to AD and apoptosis pathways in cerebellar samples from autistic individuals, to provide further evidence for pathological relevance of these cascades for autism. By using the limma package from R and false discovery rate, we demonstrated that 31% (116 out of 374) of the genes belonging to these pathways displayed significant changes in expression (corrected P-values <0.05), with mitochondria-related genes being the most downregulated. We also found upregulation of GRIN1, the channel-forming subunit of NMDA glutamate receptors, and MAP3K1, known activator of the JNK and ERK pathways with anti-apoptotic effect. Expression of PSEN2 (presinilin 2) and APBB1 (or F65) were significantly lower when compared with control samples. Based on these results, we propose a model of NMDA glutamate receptor-mediated ERK activation of Î±-secretase activity and mitochondrial adaptation to apoptosis that may explain the early brain overgrowth and disruption of synaptic plasticity and connectome in autism. Finally, systems pharmacology analyses of the model that integrates all these genes together (NOWADA) highlighted magnesium (Mg2+) and rapamycin as most efficient drugs to target this network model in silico. Their potential therapeutic application, in the context of autism, is therefore discussed.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Fares ZeidÃ¡n-ChuliÃ¡"", ids = ""1397980119""); list(name = ""B-HN de Oliveira"", ids = ""5418671""); list(name = ""Alla Salmina"", ids = ""143641736""); list(name = ""Manuel F Casanova"", ids = ""9801200""); list(name = ""Daniel Pens Gelain"", ids = ""5278878""); list(name = ""Mami Noda"", ids = ""46705927""); list(name = ""Alexei Verkhratsky"", ids = ""3922054""); list(name = ""Julio C.

480aa9856d3b92c53b93685bf51396ca0461b943,Associations of the plasma lipidome with mortality in the acute respiratory distress syndrome: a longitudinal cohort study,"BackgroundIt is unknown if the plasma lipidome is a useful tool for improving our understanding of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, we measured the plasma lipidome of individuals with ARDS at two time-points to determine if changes in the plasma lipidome distinguished survivors from non-survivors. We hypothesized that both the absolute concentration and change in concentration over time of plasma lipids are associated with 28-day mortality in this population.MethodsSamples for this longitudinal observational cohort study were collected at multiple tertiary-care academic medical centers as part of a previous multicenter clinical trial. A mass spectrometry shot-gun lipidomic assay was used to quantify the lipidome in plasma samples from 30 individuals. Samples from two different days were analyzed for each subject. After removing lipids with a coefficient of variation >â€‰30%, differences between cohorts were identified using repeated measures analysis of variance. The false discovery rate was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Relationships between significant compounds were explored using hierarchical clustering of the Pearson correlation coefficients and the magnitude of these relationships was described using receiver operating characteristic curves.ResultsThe mass spectrometry assay reliably measured 359 lipids. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, 90 compounds differed between survivors and non-survivors. Survivors had higher levels for each of these lipids except for five membrane lipids. Glycerolipids, particularly those containing polyunsaturated fatty acid side-chains, represented many of the lipids with higher concentrations in survivors. The change in lipid concentration over time did not differ between survivors and non-survivors.ConclusionsThe concentration of multiple plasma lipids is associated with mortality in this group of critically ill patients with ARDS. Absolute lipid levels provided more information than the change in concentration over time. These findings support future research aimed at integrating lipidomics into critical care medicine.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael D.

450a9a5f7bdffd2285cae99105f905248b50c1c2,Protein differences between human trapezius and vastus lateralis muscles determined with a proteomic approach,"BackgroundThe trapezius muscle is a neck muscle that is susceptible to chronic pain conditions associated with repetitive tasks, commonly referred to as chronic work-related myalgia, hence making the trapezius a muscle of clinical interest. To provide a basis for further investigations of the proteomic traits of the trapezius muscle in disease, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) was performed on the healthy trapezius using vastus lateralis as a reference. To obtain as much information as possible from the vast proteomic data set, both one-way ANOVA, with and without false discovery rate (FDR) correlation, and partial least square projection to latent structures with discriminant analysis ( PLS-DA) were combined to compare the outcome of the analysis.ResultsThe trapezius and vastus lateralis showed significant differences in metabolic, contractile and regulatory proteins, with different results depending on choice of statistical approach and pre-processing technique. Using the standard method, FDR correlated one-way ANOVA, 42 protein spots differed significantly in abundance between the two muscles. Complementary analysis using immunohistochemistry and western blot confirmed the results from the 2D-DIGE analysis.ConclusionsThe proteomic approach used in the present study combining 2D-DIGE and multivariate modelling provided a more comprehensive comparison of the protein profiles of the human trapezius and vastus lateralis muscle, than previously possible to obtain with immunohistochemistry or SDS-PAGE alone. Although 2D-DIGE has inherent limitations it is particularly useful to comprehensively screen for important structural and metabolic proteins, and appears to be a promising tool for future studies of patients suffering from chronic work related myalgia or other muscle diseases.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jenny HadrÃ©vi"", ids = ""4784449""); list(name = ""Fredrik HellstrÃ¶m"", ids = ""3836803""); list(name = ""Thomas Kieselbach"", ids = ""46280803""); list(name = ""Christer Malm"", ids = ""35136157""); list(name = ""Fatima Pedrosa-DomellÃ¶f"", ids = ""1399573683"")",2a9e7ca3a0733ebe338a689f45b95b9dad56ec0f; 0322c103f359d1449603b54c07999e7623a13e41; af5f0d4783bc5d270d070ac2d908b35225bd860c,d8b50a7f09d97dcbb8f029769a8df16613acf692; 0f5a3e47ff8d20c5368c1df25c9bd2b3b835ee33; e7d1f2d6eb4ba99e0007ee1d9fa1d517a457177b; 74ee8ff7ecb6124564bc9173355d5ea8fa7c5f5f; 22af981527752f5a22a2e1f356863e04cf9e6713; 772c8c016d60089ba42d94c223527e87a8e7c4ee; 3bfc5956092e4a1989bb11e8e216fbea30062c28; b5c738e5356503890cf0d0ba855cde0eb68e4757; 325068c70f6602bb174ff5a8aca512a6b99e10dd; c475501ea5462cd64bb7c6b59c1780d04f9ebba6; 6b85d873c0f88ee6cda31507caac3b687626baa5; 348037f50f617e69141ab07fd8e9dee9b3ea59f7; fe0d014d61c7af6ed4048ce28d7f29b897aa3b27; 6918c0d984293f4465f41bc4edc7ee3399e68ecf; c9966fd72a47ce77d6ffbdf2e23a50a6c94ebe45; 48e20d1db97697f1ada6bfa09bd9a3a15333ea89; f3b408c7795495e66f05c1bfe6f7f284104f60e9; d75bc6486f58ec36ff309db0e2c64e0f39693aa8; f08c7027b4b607c18916b527edf527ad9224a355; 91e15b7f7dc26509964723cbf605a87735f9db42; 1951d1126045c3337beacf7986916bfd603251bf; 162a615477999d90901f2e877422e6931661e967; 731eca2a578bdcb58bbdb3431deb6cd5fcf2492a; 1faf8929a5d5a965cd6c3ad4eb0ed103142b37d8; ee81e13ebc191f3f60be33c99d1f022ee9e82ef3; c38a5d5eaa2d8d22c67a581ab11268add4323e8d; f8d3e19c5074fbc820defb8fff0e475d22d7fa84; a7001156821124406ab3d415904299bd0cc6a715; 6f7fa84fe35416dfe23a79c2baaa5ddd437a53ea; 364c511ad6b40deb498af10d2a37ae5397638368; 42ed778fa934820d7e4445f7acb6867a5369faea; 17f3797e439e38bd4fe416d21d85d24e264feecb; 4015a686b615dc7301517460fb8579a0994f81e5; ef7184bbcc7fe48e6b3e09bcd9e7086d1b78246c; 7c670cfc9030c0c4c379b8bb0e44db47fcb53205; ae3c4d837cd2754ddf47de6dfc746ef29f5baf62; 9c7782ff7e4fc0f0675d83f70872e5d52184005f; 8e8494c2281ecbb58a433814f5fd68882385ef3d; 8ea021e88fa27bc2173bcfada317ede43327da79; d8e52a9a359f8419536438bc3f214c7631e344d6; 492486d2b50986189a239359650a4fae3b1c0b61; 0e0649af79f8f8abf92d13d02bcff3750e715701; e252c43cd0b9e397aeccc2050d32f67880b23bb1; eb39d9312a97a3c043d139da5ed0ad63114a537b; 7065e950741f6f25db0af884c4bb76f847d2f848; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; ac151fdcac61d47d176cd4d1ff19a4e39a9eeef4; 9f17691f93788d517ad74ec4a00db2d4a3ab62d9; 5c7ba622d5d612af632b3ef681f8183b9da54563; 8e9d758284631a9a2cc20a462367dec1a49568ee,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders,12,181 - 181
17852aebfadf57c49794d634211248611256702e,"Quality of Quality Measurement: Impact of Risk Adjustment, Hospital Volume, and Hospital Performance.","BACKGROUND
The validity of basing healthcare reimbursement policy on pay-for-performance is grounded in the accuracy of performance measurement.


METHODS
Monte Carlo simulation was used to examine the accuracy of performance profiling as a function of statistical methodology, case volume, and the extent to which hospital or physician performance deviates from the average.


RESULTS
There is extensive variation in the true-positive rate and false discovery rate as a function of model specification, hospital quality, and hospital case volume. Hierarchical and nonhierarchical modeling are both highly accurate at very high case volumes for very low-quality hospitals. At equivalent case volumes and hospital effect sizes, the true-positive rate is higher for nonhierarchical modeling than for hierarchical modeling, but the false discovery rate is generally much lower for hierarchical modeling than for nonhierarchical modeling. At low hospital case volumes (200) that are typical for many procedures, and for hospitals with twice the rate of death or major complications for patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery at the average hospital, hierarchical modeling missed 90.6% of low-quality hospitals, whereas nonhierarchical modeling missed 65.3%. However, at low case volumes, 38.9% of hospitals classified as low-quality outliers using nonhierarchical modeling were actually average quality, compared to 5.3% using hierarchical modeling.


CONCLUSIONS
Nonhierarchical modeling frequently misclassified average-quality hospitals as low quality. Hierarchical modeling commonly misclassified low-quality hospitals as average. Assuming that the consequences of misclassifying an average-quality hospital as low quality outweigh the consequences of misclassifying a low-quality hospital as average, hierarchical modeling may be the better choice for quality measurement.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Laurent G.

f523c31111a8d74bb939d04eae132ac4126aef22,Functional gene expression differences between inbred alcohol-preferring and -non-preferring rats in five brain regions.,"The objective of this study was to determine if there are innate differences in gene expression in selected CNS regions between inbred alcohol-preferring (iP) and -non-preferring (iNP) rats. Gene expression was determined in the nucleus accumbens (ACB), amygdala (AMYG), frontal cortex (FC), caudate-putamen (CPU), and hippocampus (HIPP) of alcohol-naÃ¯ve adult male iP and iNP rats, using Affymetrix Rat Genome U34A microarrays (n = 6/strain). Using Linear Modeling for Microarray Analysis with a false discovery rate threshold of 0.1, there were 16 genes with differential expression in the ACB, 54 in the AMYG, 8 in the FC, 24 in the CPU, and 21 in the HIPP. When examining the main effect of strain across regions, 296 genes were differentially expressed. Although the relatively small number of genes found significant within individual regions precluded a powerful analysis for over-represented Gene Ontology categories, the much larger list resulting from the main effect of strain analysis produced 17 over-represented categories (P < .05), including axon guidance, gliogenesis, negative regulation of programmed cell death, regulation of programmed cell death, regulation of synapse structure function, and transmission of nerve impulse. Co-citation analysis and graphing of significant genes revealed a network involved in the neuropeptide Y (NPY) transmitter system. Correlation of all significant genes with those located within previously established rat alcohol QTLs revealed that of the total of 313 significant genes, 71 are located within such QTLs. The many regional and overall gene expression differences between the iP and iNP rat lines may contribute to the divergent alcohol drinking phenotypes of these rats.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mark W.

e48eee7a52b02e18bfb2c07eb6f34ceda49fcaa8,Detecting outliers when fitting data with nonlinear regression â€“ a new method based on robust nonlinear regression and the false discovery rate,"BackgroundNonlinear regression, like linear regression, assumes that the scatter of data around the ideal curve follows a Gaussian or normal distribution. This assumption leads to the familiar goal of regression: to minimize the sum of the squares of the vertical or Y-value distances between the points and the curve. Outliers can dominate the sum-of-the-squares calculation, and lead to misleading results. However, we know of no practical method for routinely identifying outliers when fitting curves with nonlinear regression.ResultsWe describe a new method for identifying outliers when fitting data with nonlinear regression. We first fit the data using a robust form of nonlinear regression, based on the assumption that scatter follows a Lorentzian distribution. We devised a new adaptive method that gradually becomes more robust as the method proceeds. To define outliers, we adapted the false discovery rate approach to handling multiple comparisons. We then remove the outliers, and analyze the data using ordinary least-squares regression. Because the method combines robust regression and outlier removal, we call it the ROUT method.When analyzing simulated data, where all scatter is Gaussian, our method detects (falsely) one or more outlier in only about 1â€“3% of experiments. When analyzing data contaminated with one or several outliers, the ROUT method performs well at outlier identification, with an average False Discovery Rate less than 1%.ConclusionOur method, which combines a new method of robust nonlinear regression with a new method of outlier identification, identifies outliers from nonlinear curve fits with reasonable power and few false positives.",2005,Medicine; Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Harvey J.

2bdb31efed951afcc80c7a93db51bc0d3a55c5e4,Pruning variable selection ensembles,"In the context of variable selection, ensemble learning has gained increasing interest due to its great potential to improve selection accuracy and to reduce false discovery rate. A novel ordering-based selective ensemble learning strategy is designed in this paper to obtain smaller but more accurate ensembles. In particular, a greedy sorting strategy is proposed to rearrange the order by which the members are included into the integration process. Through stopping the fusion process early, a smaller subensemble with higher selection accuracy can be obtained. More importantly, the sequential inclusion criterion reveals the fundamental strength-diversity trade-off among ensemble members. By taking stability selection (abbreviated as StabSel) as an example, some experiments are conducted with both simulated and real-world data to examine the performance of the novel algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that pruned StabSel generally achieves higher selection accuracy and lower false discovery rates than StabSel and several other benchmark methods.",2019,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Chunxia Zhang"", ids = ""47423527""); list(name = ""Yilei Wu"", ids = ""2984676""); list(name = ""Mu Zhu"", ids = ""145636716"")",,d4783d05ae9dd82a53883d33a767ef4ab0af789b; c9e55b6ecc6f65d2735830dede4f8d2bdf531d34; 48d36579b83470650967b0c903e6af005ec10685; b8ff13570f6f0d8b93c3d22cf2048d6f310a0a5e; 5293e78c979b3a91da2b748b03727638fcfbedf2; 0a289dd59b8043c0fbe3a4d1ae59055476ddb3ff; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 61c960f6047dbf9a1c8d31735a0c91348daaa7f1; e95afbe568564537f1058e2b854f7b3a3bc411b2; 98c3ec599685663e00bae07ab77b68021491cfc8; 5e7c71ea20fb087d64319e8ab51caaf537024cc7; cf6da91d65cf8f01c4708fd95044e55fa495478c; e30a47911cfb98934dc640eb669b9351827bd37b; f28fda85187c2279fc439e2c99a0e77820f0aec4; 3608d5f13c7426e1b22260f9042c85ec463bad62; e6907624d26b7de736bd60377316c3a80dd9f156; 13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986; ba5d7c8f3b912dc12fc99e9666eb629f24d66506; ca31809ff996f4041f723b9b89ff32ad14d66317; c67136ab0e52283d5b3beef23fe318eb9f455cb7; 55a50e80a1f433f393576de3b09c56777fa1b69a; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; be4fd29e3225d8451b02683f1a32baef0483266a; 95dc9f19210c3ab703ad9bb61a1d02f9aa2a54b7; 038a7a72731a456deb9d03572f1bffab3522b5f5; bcb6621e145407a0dd1ba93d76f3e3ccbcc1b199; 399a591052b8afcceb9c3083e50da3759492ab7d; 6577213dab981883f03a083c9e495f1a707035da; 91e2bf07848784d6feac15b8b900e784341bf9cc; d0d08bc641d5b78d534946af4134f77fb6f240e0; 7a92314ff9ef62aab0f30510225736aa30aa7b84; 5059480e11236fe961e5e13eb6e3c4c429bcb38a; 49f4143eb35926b031df823eeed0458ed40e2f40; d3171846a4b041258ba6fb50f8609fb325b0fa3a; 49474fd116db60f1633ce452e26beabd9480d499; ea795aa08f642a2d8944f71d7f13a689661d91df,ArXiv,abs/1704.08265,
ad32538ca52a39d57c996a66edbc9f2bf5d011a6,Sparse regression and marginal testing using cluster prototypes.,"We propose a new approach for sparse regression and marginal testing, for data with correlated features. Our procedure first clusters the features, and then chooses as the cluster prototype the most informative feature in that cluster. Then we apply either sparse regression (lasso) or marginal significance testing to these prototypes. While this kind of strategy is not entirely new, a key feature of our proposal is its use of the post-selection inference theory of Taylor and others (2014, Exact post-selection inference for forward stepwise and least angle regression, Preprint, arXiv:1401.3889) and Lee and others (2014, Exact post-selection inference with the lasso, Preprint, arXiv:1311.6238v5) to compute exact [Formula: see text]-values and confidence intervals that properly account for the selection of prototypes. We also apply the recent ""knockoff"" idea of Barber and CandÃ¨s (2014, Controlling the false discovery rate via knockoffs, Preprint, arXiv:1404.5609) to provide exact finite sample control of the FDR of our regression procedure.

07838ddc56227ee41b135920a9acac0a19aaa835,Identifying Disease-Associated Functions Based on Weak Signals of Differential Expressions of Genes,"When the degree of gene expression difference between two groups of samples is low or the number of samples is small,we are often unable to identify sufficient differentially expressed(DE) genes for the subsequent functional enrichment analysis at a conventional false discovery rate(FDR) control level(e.g.5% or 10%).However,functional enrichment analysis is to some extent robust to the false discoveries of DE genes.Therefore,a low FDR control level that allows a high FDR of the selected DE genes may be used to reliably detect disease-associated functions.In this study,we analyzed five microarray datasets for studying the metastasis of breast cancer.Based on three of the five datasets with relatively strong signals of differential gene expression,we demonstrated that even when the FDR of the DE genes reached 25%,the functional enrichment analysis showed high robustness.Next,in the other two datasets with weak signals of differential gene expressions,we selected DE genes with FDR25% to perform the functional enrichment analysis,and compared the results with those obtained from the previous three datasets.The results showed that many functions associated with breast cancer metastasis could still be reliably identified using a low FDR control level for the identification of DE genes.The results also showed that a wide range of gene expressions in some general biological processes(such as cell division,cell cycle and DNA replication) might be altered during the course of breast cancer metastasis,reflecting that breast cancer metastasis is a 'systems disease' with global gene expression changes.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Guo Zheng"", ids = ""48757107"")",dfdc09baa9732c2b1ecd4c31b04f85d720754822,,,,

For this purpose in pea (Pisum sativum L.), we genotyped and phenotyped individual lines of the single-plant-derived core collection of the USDA pea collection including accessions from 330 landraces and cultivars of Pisum sativum subsp. sativum var. sativum, 28 P. sativum subsp. elatius var. elatius, 16 P. sativum subsp. sativum var. arvense, four P. sativum subsp. elatius var. pumilio, three P. abyssinicum, two P. fulvum, and one P. sativum subsp. transcaucasicum. These 384 accessions were collected or donated from a total of 64 countries. The accessions were genotyped with 256 informative SNPs using a primer extension chemistry and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDIâ€“TOF) mass spectrometry assay. Genetic structure analysis showed that the collection was structured into two main groups, corresponding roughly to the cultivated types/landraces and the more primitive form species and subspecies, with some intermediates. Linkage disequilibrium of pairwise loci and population structure of the collection were analyzed, and an association analysis between SNP genotypes and 25 valuable traits such as disease resistance, seed type/color, flower color, seed low molecular weight carbohydrate concentration, and seed mineral nutrient concentration was performed using a mixed linear model. A total of 71 markerâ€“trait associations were detected as significant with 1â€“34 markers per trait based on the false discovery rate (FDRÂ <Â 0.05).

d89d90b722857183d5671a8c5bbda045cbc3d1cc,Molecular assessment of differences in the duodenal microbiome in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome.,"OBJECTIVE
Breath testing and duodenal culture studies suggest that a significant proportion of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. In this study, we extended these data through 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses of duodenal aspirates from a large cohort of IBS, non-IBS and control subjects.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Consecutive subjects presenting for esophagogastroduodenoscopy only and healthy controls were recruited. Exclusion criteria included recent antibiotic or probiotic use. Following extensive medical work-up, patients were evaluated for symptoms of IBS. DNAs were isolated from duodenal aspirates obtained during endoscopy. Microbial populations in a subset of IBS subjects and controls were compared by 16S profiling. Duodenal microbes were then quantitated in the entire cohort by qPCR and the results compared with quantitative live culture data.


RESULTS
A total of 258 subjects were recruited (21 healthy, 163 non-healthy non-IBS, and 74 IBS). 16S profiling in five IBS and five control subjects revealed significantly lower microbial diversity in the duodenum in IBS, with significant alterations in 12 genera (false discovery rate < 0.15), including overrepresentation of Escherichia/Shigella (p = 0.005) and Aeromonas (p = 0.051) and underrepresentation of Acinetobacter (p = 0.024), Citrobacter (p = 0.031) and Microvirgula (p = 0.036). qPCR in all 258 subjects confirmed greater levels of Escherichia coli in IBS and also revealed increases in Klebsiella spp, which correlated strongly with quantitative culture data.


CONCLUSIONS
16S rDNA sequencing confirms microbial overgrowth in the small bowel in IBS, with a concomitant reduction in diversity. qPCR supports alterations in specific microbial populations in IBS.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Evangelos J.

ec8a59fd1fcd25083d0933c071de718c0fe22630,MAGICTRICKS: A tool for predicting transcription factors and cofactors that drive gene lists,"ABSTRACT Transcriptomic profiling is an immensely powerful hypothesis generating tool. However, accurately predicting the transcription factors (TFs) and cofactors that drive transcriptomic differences between samples represents a challenge and current approaches are limited by high false discovery rates. This is due to the use of TF binding sequence motifs that, due their small size, are found randomly throughout the genome, and do not allow discovery of cofactors. A second limitation is that even the most advanced approaches that use ChIPseq tracks hosted at sites such as the Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) assign TFs and cofactors to genes via a binary designation of â€˜targetâ€™, or â€˜non-targetâ€™ that ignores the intricacies of the biology behind transcriptional regulation. ENCODE archives ChIPseq tracks of 169 TFs and cofactors assayed in 91 cell lines. The algorithm presented herein, Mining Gene Cohorts for Transcriptional Regulators Inferred by Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistics (MAGICTRICKS), uses ENCODE ChIPseq data to look for statistical enrichment of TFs and cofactors in gene bodies and flanking regions in gene lists. When compared to 2 commonly used web resources, o-Possum and Enrichr, MAGICTRICKS was able to more accurately predict TFs and cofactors that drive gene changes in 3 settings: 1) A cell line expressing or lacking single TF, 2) Breast tumors divided along PAM50 designations and 3) Whole brain samples from WT mice or mice lacking a single TF in a particular neuronal subtype. In summary, MAGICTRICKS is a standalone application that runs on OSX and Windows machines that produces meaningful predictions of which TFs and cofactors are enriched in a gene list.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Avtar Roopra"", ids = ""50666254"")",,,bioRxiv,,492744

The association between subcortical and cortical structural alterations, and glutamatergic neurometabolites is of particular interest due to glutamateâ€™s capacity for neurotoxicity; elevated levels may be related to neuroanatomical compromise through an excitotoxic process. To this end, we explored the relationships between glutamatergic neurometabolites and structural measures in antipsychotic-naive patients experiencing their first non-affective episode of psychosis (FEP). Sixty antipsychotic-naive patients with FEP and 60 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent a magnetic resonance imaging session, which included a T1-weighted volumetric image and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the precommissural dorsal caudate. Group differences in precommissural caudate volume (PCV) and cortical thickness (CT), and the relationships between glutamatergic neurometabolites (ie, glutamate+glutamine (Glx) and glutamate) and these structural measures, were examined. PCV was decreased in the FEP group (p<0.001), yet did not differ when controlling for total brain volume. Cortical thinning existed in the FEP group within frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, and limbic regions at a 5% false discovery rate. Glx levels were negatively associated with PCV only in the FEP group (p=0.018). The observed relationship between Glx and PCV in the FEP group is supportive of a focal excitotoxic mechanism whereby increased levels of glutamatergic markers are related to local structural losses. This process may be related to the prominent structural deficits that exist in patients with schizophrenia.",2016,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Eric Plitman"", ids = ""5322716""); list(name = ""Raihaan Patel"", ids = ""7323732""); list(name = ""Jun Ku Chung"", ids = ""3750535""); list(name = ""Jon Pipitone"", ids = ""2236316""); list(name = ""Sofia Emilia Chavez"", ids = ""14289499""); list(name = ""Francisco Reyes-Madrigal"", ids = ""1404520056""); list(name = ""Gladys GÃ³mez-Cruz"", ids = ""1454625950""); list(name = ""Pablo LeÃ³n-OrtÃ­z"", ids = ""1402407479""); list(name = ""M.

e59675faf6b3a099efba2c6b016ee173f8b562bf,Sex differences in primary muscle afferent sensitization following ischemia and reperfusion injury,"BackgroundChronic pain conditions are more prevalent in women, but most preclinical studies into mechanisms of pain generation are performed using male animals. Furthermore, whereas group III and IV nociceptive muscle afferents provoke central sensitization more effectively than their cutaneous counterparts, less is known about this critical population of muscle nociceptors. Here, we compare the physiology of individual muscle afferents in uninjured males and females. We then characterize the molecular, physiological, and behavioral effects of transient ischemia and reperfusion injury (I/R), a model we have extensively studied in males and in females.MethodsResponse properties and phenotypes to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimulation were compared using an ex vivo muscle/nerve/dorsal root ganglia (DRG)/spinal cord recording preparation. Analyses of injury-related changes were also performed by assaying evoked and spontaneous pain-related behaviors, as well as mRNA expression of the affected muscle and DRGs. The appropriate analyses of variance and post hoc tests (with false discovery rate corrections when needed) were performed for each measure.ResultsFemales have more mechanically sensitive muscle afferents and show greater mechanical and thermal responsiveness than what is found in males. With I/R, both sexes show fewer cells responsive to an innocuous metabolite solution (ATP, lactic acid, and protons), and lower mechanical thresholds in individual afferents; however, females also possess altered thermal responsiveness, which may be related to sex-dependent changes in gene expression within the affected DRGs. Regardless, both sexes show similar increases in I/R-induced pain-like behaviors.ConclusionsHere, we illustrate a unique phenomenon wherein discrete, sex-dependent mechanisms of primary muscle afferent sensitization after ischemic injury to the periphery may underlie similar behavioral changes between the sexes. Furthermore, although the group III and IV muscle afferents are fully developed functionally, the differential mechanisms of sensitization manifest prior to sexual maturity.

cc27247db97803f1d70e85a6c989c5e8e4481802,Detection of multivariate outliers in business survey data with incomplete information,"Many different methods for statistical data editing can be found in the literature but only few of them are based on robust estimates (for example such as BACON-EEM, epidemic algorithms (EA) and transformed rank correlation (TRC) methods of BÃ©guin and Hulliger). However, we can show that outlier detection is only reasonable if robust methods are applied, because the classical estimates are themselves influenced by the outliers. Nevertheless, data editing is essential to check the multivariate data for possible data problems and it is not deterministic like the traditional micro editing where all records are extensively edited manually using certain rules/constraints. The presence of missing values is more a rule than an exception in business surveys and poses additional severe challenges to the outlier detection. First we review the available multivariate outlier detection methods which can cope with incomplete data. In a simulation study, where a subset of the Austrian Structural Business Statistics is simulated, we compare several approaches. Robust methods based on the Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimator, S-estimators and OGK-estimator as well as BACON-BEM provide the best results in finding the outliers and in providing a low false discovery rate.

c055b3c71aa0e921db74d9eb29d88830680dc08e,Statistical epistasis between candidate gene alleles for complex tuber traits in an association mapping population of tetraploid potato,"Association mapping using DNA-based markers is a novel tool in plant genetics for the analysis of complex traits. Potato tuber yield, starch content, starch yield and chip color are complex traits of agronomic relevance, for which carbohydrate metabolism plays an important role. At the functional level, the genes and biochemical pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism are among the best studied in plants. Quantitative traits such as tuber starch and sugar content are therefore models for association genetics in potato based on candidate genes. In an association mapping experiment conducted with a population of 243 tetraploid potato varieties and breeding clones, we previously identified associations between individual candidate gene alleles and tuber starch content, starch yield and chip quality. In the present paper, we tested 190 DNA markers at 36 loci scored in the same association mapping population for pairwise statistical epistatic interactions. Fifty marker pairs were associated mainly with tuber starch content and/or starch yield, at a cut-off value of qÂ â‰¤Â 0.20 for the experiment-wide false discovery rate (FDR). Thirteen marker pairs had an FDR of qÂ â‰¤Â 0.10. Alleles at loci encoding ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase (Rca), sucrose phosphate synthase (Sps) and vacuolar invertase (Pain1) were most frequently involved in statistical epistatic interactions. The largest effect on tuber starch content and starch yield was observed for the paired alleles Pain1-8c and Rca-1a, explaining 9 and 10% of the total variance, respectively. The combination of these two alleles increased the means of tuber starch content and starch yield.

8c6b2e6706a97c34e0599187a0df677105bbf6e1,Characterization and Diagnostic Value of Amino Acid Side Chain Neutral Losses Following Electron-Transfer Dissociation,"Using a large set of high mass accuracy and resolution ETD tandem mass spectra, we characterized ETD-induced neutral losses. From these data we deduced the chemical formula for 20 of these losses. Many of them have been previously observed in electron-capture dissociation (ECD) spectra, such as losses of the side chains of arginine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glutamine, asparagine, leucine, histidine, and carbamidomethylated cysteine residues. With this information, we examined the diagnostic value of these amino acid-specific losses. Among 1285 peptideâ€“spectrum matches, 92.5% have agreement between neutral loss-derived peptide amino acid composition and the peptide sequences. Moreover, we show that peptides can be uniquely identified by using only the accurate precursor mass and amino acid composition based on neutral losses; the median number of sequence candidates from an accurate mass query is reduced from 21 to 8 by adding side chain loss information. Besides increasing confidence in peptide identification, our findings suggest the potential use of these diagnostic losses in ETD spectra to improve false discovery rate estimation and to enhance the performance of scoring functions in database search algorithms.",2011,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qiangwei Xia"", ids = ""47244194""); list(name = ""M Violet Lee"", ids = ""94555907""); list(name = ""Christopher M.

4335b9eba95027d4d6aed92afa10101054010964,A CpG-SNP Located within the ARPC3 Gene Promoter Is Associated with Hypertriglyceridemia in Severely Obese Patients,"Aims: To test the potential association of cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides (CpG)-single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 3 (ARPC3), a gene recently linked to adipogenesis and lipid accumulation, with metabolic syndrome (MetS) features in severely obese patients. Methods: Prioritized SNPs within the ARPC3 locus were genotyped and tested for associations with MetS features in a cohort of 1,749 obese patients with and without MetS. Association testing with CpG methylation levels was performed in a methylation sub-cohort of 16 obese men. Results: A significant association was found between the CpG-SNP rs3759384 (C>T) and plasma triglyceride (TG) levels (false discovery rate-corrected p = 3.5 Ã— 10-2), with 0.6% of the phenotypic variance explained by the CpG-SNP, and with TT homozygotes showing the highest plasma TG levels (1.89 mmol/l). The carriers of the rs3759384 T allele also showed a significant decrease in methylation levels of the ARPC3 promoter-associated CpG site cg10738648 in both visceral adipose tissue and blood. ARPC3 expression levels showed a strong correlation with plasma TG levels (r = 0.70; p = 0.02). Conclusions: The increased plasma TG levels found in homozygous rs3759384 T allele carriers argue for a relevant role of this CpG-SNP in lipid management among obese individuals, which may be driven by an epigenetic-mediated mechanism.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Juan de Toro-MartÃ­n"", ids = ""1398193891""); list(name = ""FrÃ©dÃ©ric GuÃ©nard"", ids = ""4215417""); list(name = ""AndrÃ© Tchernof"", ids = ""2960424""); list(name = ""Yves Deshaies"", ids = ""6338616""); list(name = ""Louis PÃ©russe"", ids = ""4776997""); list(name = ""Simon Biron"", ids = ""6561359""); list(name = ""Odette Lescelleur"", ids = ""4414362""); list(name = ""Laurent Biertho"", ids = ""47071185""); list(name = ""Simon Marceau"", ids = ""5599041""); list(name = ""Marie-Claude Vohl"", ids = ""119671034"")",227f28f10be0ab77f59573484d03ec023c576646; 17f240b2be9b032a85b6671d421bee2e091a6ecf; 0620ca47c58d58be82b9bb5b705d6b307aafb7ed; ed89ff2d7a6796d3eed7f3245384b8ce278743df; d3fece08204d4a0208b019f763f6724e094d6385; eae48ff6df01eb34bcbc587d59fbe453018c4076; 10e2ec58f156234cc86c02a4cb6ee49710902471; dc45459532555a3129270247ad1b395e408acfe9; 8e7a87cbb3d65b9e96ee3fe1dd109f31222de569,c7f1b64c559cda798efe11347ca15fe0b962cffb; 57262462d1156fcd26ecaae70f51f1cb3936ac75; 006cb788412eef6bc25c012ddc0b4dd73cbe937c; ece882b243dd45a26ac1ab1b5a537c9b1005a921; 52d7f20c88570566c32f5ad521c7e0a33a95a671; 7ddb82e26920aef0e102ac6fbe04f76b0ccf4082; 70182e841fda39cd3ecd129c93079bbaec511f24; 2d598249b2bf2f5b8c5cb98e6208146dacdc1406; faea0a355978c99c2e17ec961f458aa83f5b7fa0; 2ad6572c5668fdb3b2375e32874dc0e7a64022f7; 6814d976154b17e41bc79f8694e2372534e50419; 28bd163ca11ffd0296c24f3927a8aab2b0d07bfb; c850f7b8fd0d05efe75d05a0af2606c3bc56970a; b7bc3a5c5925899f545b5fd097e691e2c480d274; f5f4728fc62d0d109cc2fbeb26c6702d125017f6; cc32bf0e12aea7918a6a973955405695d82f4c2b; a0031a71b94318afa099bb81af800d1555d245ae; 539e28a93c35fb9858e16970244bd49272b58f15; ab9fe0fe3b39e6f36dcf74a715e7adcd218325b2; 996bb7d74a57c372a0ee75ab87538670af2143d0; 7159c3ec535810f64351a1a9449e293161eafbbf; d40f676e594622ef7c958b14be971103b452023a; b618c1563b35023c12747867cd1164935231f262; dd1b3a3793619cec8994cc7cca10e6dee656fb7b; 2c914f3d0b5552f1f7f100719ed57ff5c2627a76; b326d0613dca02c699717d56d56f008c4b95fb87; 771db07978d3c2be11ec6b98e2e532a759db25d3; 81bae48c81ee58c6ff9462fc3dd93d47c95fe8af; 3f9a1445555b0509d56e606efd8f5ed606efe0dc; b27fb570b624ae7066c0a9337104e15c990a10cd; 1823369c9598887dbdf126ad7073585682be1b66; fed97442208146c7ffef477c11efdb25ca8aa7e2; 4a111cb58456743375e740889b3dba326813fa84; c0611bb39a1532664e0fefb0c50431e66aa8ca7f; e90f64b9a149b8e78af7b8fd1e0671f8222a81c6; 7b3b16b62fd85fb03727a28ed514ed6d929f443c; 38022cbf1b307c12d16ee7a46d103ace55d330cb; cfc3e303fee11e77c0efb978a9c2a50c845929b7; 4d41a35ccbc7d89052a0ce0393818f9ecc04aa38; 3a6254529a54807da55b1de206aa1ce8be5897c9; c3e5d78e29b6ef9c9dba8b3f005a07634e19ab77; bb8ea9050b3d6bb66c397147e18c2b7043a4dc3d; 9f5096322b170b26f4e2c5defbadd8023f08c5db; d966072bb062e766e6d7aaff43f3fbb8026621e3; 0aa9219598e466e79eb030973f9b720a0ec8b876,Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism,68,203 - 212
cc23587459e8854feda425696618da194bd97861,Relevance of genetic relationship in GWAS and genomic prediction,"The objective of this study was to analyze the relevance of relationship information on the identification of low heritability quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and on the genomic prediction of complex traits in human, animal and cross-pollinating populations. The simulation-based data sets included 50 samples of 1000 individuals of seven populations derived from a common population with linkage disequilibrium. The populations had non-inbred and inbred progeny structure (50 to 200) with varying number of members (5 to 20). The individuals were genotyped for 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotyped for a quantitative trait controlled by 10 QTLs and 90 minor genes showing dominance. The SNP density was 0.1Â cM and the narrow sense heritability was 25%. The QTL heritabilities ranged from 1.1 to 2.9%. We applied mixed model approaches for both GWAS and genomic prediction using pedigree-based and genomic relationship matrices. For GWAS, the observed false discovery rate was kept below the significance level of 5%, the power of detection for the low heritability QTLs ranged from 14 to 50%, and the average bias between significant SNPs and a QTL ranged from less than 0.01 to 0.23Â cM. The QTL detection power was consistently higher using genomic relationship matrix. Regardless of population and training set size, genomic prediction provided higher prediction accuracy of complex trait when compared to pedigree-based prediction. The accuracy of genomic prediction when there is relatedness between individuals in the training set and the reference population is much higher than the value for unrelated individuals.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Helcio Duarte Pereira"", ids = ""30122773""); list(name = ""JosÃ© Marcelo Soriano Viana"", ids = ""147157849""); list(name = ""AndrÃ©a Carla Bastos Andrade"", ids = ""39990230""); list(name = ""Fabyano Fonseca e Silva"", ids = ""48522999""); list(name = ""GeÃ­sa Pinheiro Paes"", ids = ""33016376"")",69d4b33db4713cc20c089b8646df5ad09dc3712b; a3349e4161eb64aa2143899250e2008b0a2e3482,b4c69cf34916b2495c57e0d2e316edbcc11824ed; 8de0f4d3168750a2509a7ef72131e055aba4c674; 11f595d30f22869054d2da81c6ce194087e19bf4; c61e378c244020643944594ff4208ed20ce887ed; 14732d6241738d73ede41e0846239d4895ea7f68; 9dc3b72ecdeedfece817b3dec98dda1e4253f09b; 72de31338c688d820c30ae5380d5a6b2ad98017a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c6cb87c3a011d106b650b3a4cd10da9a5b147614; 988f4e2f7d826b75e4528e3bd54f11e2e8a55ba9; 82cd42482127b3707f1d6585d2d7b43c3c79db1e; cfe87bb1f6e81639c8aafc2842d3ec2dbe965379; b37ea6e3e7d618d59dc15e1af5d68f2fe0d483ed; 64c7ccc8c53c41dd1d5d2936271af4b518733c12; 1c8aa5b42e0945eb7fc12b7ed976ad909887fb62; 7bc099b8460c396a626a786d2943a1b74bc4ea0f; 113d6586327b9a919779e73f609ac840634e1f66; 4711436322751cacfe4e7abdf2af8c5f59522f2a; 7ab041489f34ee89e175741eca4358ed3450c3b9; dc965cec5e17db39602a8924eb1dcfc8af894d74; 197c241b54bce47e1803ca889fa8f93194dfa42c; e05e1312133bcd23b3912ac5b48649ae6a0f2e6e; fe272b4ea61c40a547da017bac091436aa876438; 3eacfaa3fca2e877c6bed0201546bbc5434c65d8; a2c4f79c710af13235c27d2621590cbbef8d9792; 507197d74a29455595325e686a2eef6594b5863a; d195789c60ad1c27c7c4ae1255c1e1049b5b8661; c850813fe8d6249806ead14f7fcad21e7932f21d; 664c35153f06262d259b83859a68b9fc0c36bb07; 2a73ef0954494107f3fc359b13bd308c5f873e7a; c6c9e1f34261cc173eb9f1adfc79607294856053; a9b588803315d93882007b894b53003563067408; 4b41ac7f9dc0eaeb582e0eca3c77e432cd80e4c9; 338917798120f9b79c0dbb8844de3988725874d9; bd6e45caed04286a115e1a20a0f8bce30fc9c451; 9e32ca85c9b4102d4efe23c6babe0b467cede48b,Journal of Applied Genetics,59,1-8

Distinguishing the early driver mutations from subsequent passenger mutations is key to molecular sub- typing of cancers, understanding cancer progression, and the discovery of novel biomarkers. The advances of genomics technologies (whole-genome exome, and transcript sequencing, collectively referred to as NGS(Next Gengeration Sequencing)) have fueled recent studies on somatic mutation discovery. However, the vision is challenged by the complexity, redundancy, and errors in genomic data, and the difficulty of investigating the proteome translated portion of aberrant genes using only genomic approaches. Combination of proteomic and genomic technologies are increasingly being employed. This thesis provides a discussion of applying different strategies relating to large database search, and FDR(False Discovery Rate) based error control, and their implication to cancer proteogenomics. Moreover, it extends and develops the idea of a unified genomic variant database that can be searched by any mass spectrometry sample. Furthermore, we introduce a novel database creation method targeted for immunoglobulin peptide search. Finally, by applying our integrative proteogenomics pipeline, we have identified various types of mutated peptides and immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. Overall statistics and important examples of our proteogenomic discoveries will be shown throughout this study",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Sunghee Woo"", ids = ""49828630"")",,,,,
b72050b5c933ba594c3ebfc87fae9740f0e65e8b,An improved algorithm for the detection of genomic variation using short oligonucleotide expression microarrays.,"High-throughput microarray experiments often generate far more biological information than is required to test the experimental hypotheses. Many microarray analyses are considered finished after differential expression and additional analyses are typically not performed, leaving untapped biological information left undiscovered. This is especially true if the microarray experiment is from an ecological study of multiple populations. Comparisons across populations may also contain important genomic polymorphisms, and a subset of these polymorphisms may be identified with microarrays using techniques for the detection of single feature polymorphisms (SFP). SFPs are differences in microarray probe level intensities caused by genetic polymorphisms such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions/deletions and not expression differences. In this study, we provide a new algorithm for the detection of SFPs, evaluate the algorithm using existing data from two publicly available Affymetrix Barley (Hordeum vulgare) microarray data sets and compare them to two previously published SFP detection algorithms. Results show that our algorithm provides more consistent and sensitive calling of SFPs with a lower false discovery rate. Simultaneous analysis of SFPs and differential expression is a low-cost method for the enhanced analysis of microarray data, enabling additional biological inferences to be made.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Matthew L.

738ebf8875c989e2e2ad79a4b21defe3ce00a12f,Plasma lipoproteome in Alzheimerâ€™s disease: a proof-of-concept study,"BackgroundAlthough total plasma lipoproteome consists of proteins that have shown promises as biomarkers that can identify Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), effect sizes are modest. The objective of this study is to provide initial proof-of-concept that the plasma lipoproteome more likely differ between AD cases and controls when measured in individual plasma lipoprotein fractions than when measured as total in immunodepleted plasma.MethodsWe first developed a targeted proteomics method based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry for measurement of 120 tryptic peptides from 79 proteins that are commonly present in plasma lipoproteins. Then in a proof-of concept caseâ€“control study of 5 AD cases and 5 sex- and age-matched controls, we applied the targeted proteomic method and performed relatively quantification of 120 tryptic peptides in plasma lipoprotein fractions (fractionated by sequential gradient ultracentrifugation) and in immunodepleted plasma (of albumin and IgG). Unadjusted p values from two-sample t-tests and overall fold change was used to evaluate a peptide relative difference between AD cases and controls, with lower p values (<â€‰0.05) or greater fold differences (>â€‰1.05 orâ€‰<â€‰0.95) suggestive of greater peptide/protein differences.ResultsWithin-day and between-days technical precisions (mean %CV [SD] of all SRM transitions) of the targeted proteomic method were 3.95% (2.65) and 9.31% (5.59), respectively. Between-days technical precisions (mean % CV [SD]) of the entire plasma lipoproteomic workflow including plasma lipoprotein fractionation was 27.90% (14.61). Ten tryptic peptides that belonged to 5 proteins in plasma lipoproteins had unadjusted p valuesâ€‰<â€‰0.05, compared to no peptides in immunodepleted plasma. Furthermore, 27, 32, 17, and 20 tryptic peptides in VLDL, IDL, LDL and HDL, demonstrated overall peptide fold differencesâ€‰>â€‰1.05 orâ€‰<â€‰0.95, compared to only 6 tryptic peptides in immunodepleted plasma. The overall comparisons, therefore, suggested greater peptide/protein differences in plasma lipoproteome when measured in individual plasma lipoproteins than as total in immunodepleted plasma. Specifically, protein complement C3â€™s peptide IHWESASLLR, had unadjusted p values of 0.00007, 0.00012, and 0.0006 and overall 1.25, 1.17, 1.14-fold changes in VLDL, IDL, and LDL, respectively.

58352bfc164b8b4c51d911ba648865ffd613542f,Detecting differential expression in microarray data: comparison of optimal procedures,"BackgroundMany procedures for finding differentially expressed genes in microarray data are based on classical or modified t-statistics. Due to multiple testing considerations, the false discovery rate (FDR) is the key tool for assessing the significance of these test statistics. Two recent papers have generalized two aspects: Storey et al. (2005) have introduced a likelihood ratio test statistic for two-sample situations that has desirable theoretical properties (optimal discovery procedure, ODP), but uses standard FDR assessment; Ploner et al. (2006) have introduced a multivariate local FDR that allows incorporation of standard error information, but uses the standard t-statistic (fdr2d). The relationship and relative performance of these methods in two-sample comparisons is currently unknown.MethodsUsing simulated and real datasets, we compare the ODP and fdr2d procedures. We also introduce a new procedure called S2d that combines the ODP test statistic with the extended FDR assessment of fdr2d.ResultsFor both simulated and real datasets, fdr2d performs better than ODP. As expected, both methods perform better than a standard t-statistic with standard local FDR. The new procedure S2d performs as well as fdr2d on simulated data, but performs better on the real data sets.ConclusionThe ODP can be improved by including the standard error information as in fdr2d. This means that the optimality enjoyed in theory by ODP does not hold for the estimated version that has to be used in practice. The new procedure S2d has a slight advantage over fdr2d, which has to be balanced against a significantly higher computational effort and a less intuititive test statistic.",2006,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Elena Perelman"", ids = ""31832491""); list(name = ""Alexander Ploner"", ids = ""47353253""); list(name = ""Stefano Calza"", ids = ""50050777""); list(name = ""Yudi Pawitan"", ids = ""2445755"")",90a2a38c1ee085e3814f80df618e56ea71f033f9; 24625af64895094edce1dbbbb265e6ef322bdec1; ec72b5ed9f2b6f993cd5acf66cf47473c8a0a081; e8a4f6be2411340c66ce1bfe9da58e8785b6ff10; ab628fa6934feb7aa38f3eaffddf8a641b1225c1; 2fae44021997624c09c023d7da4e44b9eb483492; 5c568b7a10dcf7feb615220ef703573e2c4ce565; b42facbad645ce1b6911404781fc354d9945a5a2; b0eaacddf63190bd7f41ba346cfbc814d5f96763; 850ea817aaf321975bbecfd9f6f048703c0b9b92; 4311371a38a2cc54f4b19b45f15e951d725544cc; bb6e43a43589a78f10ebfe9432b8701142b3a4d4; 4dfc7249fc29d612476cc396cea9839a550f5efb,7ec68a870bd61810ee957b7ffaa3740da86ae9c7; fd4b45dcbdca97567ef0b0a085824a5044d884d4; 7aeace2306487c5e5f3ff6711e1a5d3fc1e4c899; fce009e245d2af43003c7bf7dd34d4ecd0476a05; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; 569cd7a400a2b438c86c288c2b31479dc62e563c; 1d5b3054f267584dc5a730e9e3754b682d7888b8; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; bf4c8bc8ddba4521eb0955707af4f28b5535658e; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; f731f5810b79982cdd5da5330ee98e54f9c34be4; 840c0cdb1f428d300cd7986d170da5f807b3d20d; 686abad29d835044cf97434c3c0fb9f80321c856; 18f677e5ee3f15a5531f45052a2bc78c15a800a4; 405cbbeff94d27c0e45ea18241bcc13edc16bf83; 95124346ee368ebdf57e003b1fa6a656beda0344; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753,BMC Bioinformatics,8,28 - 28

This characteristic makes OP a potential feed supplement in livestock nutrition. Thus, in the last years, several studies have been published to evaluate the productive traits following OP supplementation in animal diets; however, relatively little is known from a molecular biology standpoint. Therefore, in this study, we report the RNA-sequencing analysis of laying hens fed with a 10% dried OP (DOP) supplementation. Applying a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 and a Log2Fc either less than -1.5 or higher than +1.5, we identified 264 differentially regulated genes (DEGs) between the non-supplemented diet control group (CTR) and the DOP group. Using the 264 DEGs to identify enriched biological pathways, we noted that cholesterol biosynthesis showed the highest enrichment followed by several pathways related to immune response and inflammation. As a consequence, when we quantified the cholesterol amount in yolk egg, we found a significant reduction in the DOP vs. the CTR group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study shows that DPO affects gene expression in laying hens, which is directly correlated with cholesterol decrease and can potentially ameliorate health status influencing immune response and inflammation.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Marco Iannaccone"", ids = ""145354019""); list(name = ""Andrea Ianni"", ids = ""94118181""); list(name = ""Solange Ramazzotti"", ids = ""77080240""); list(name = ""Lisa Grotta"", ids = ""49745130""); list(name = ""Elettra Marone"", ids = ""36496233""); list(name = ""Angelo Cichelli"", ids = ""14280151""); list(name = ""Giuseppe Martino"", ids = ""143881908"")",ba9e1b2281dd6eacd050207fa9393759d272dcc6; a23e74dcd74ed8828d959b2e74b0bd94882f07d1; 19a2213eb60918b9d2915feaec240443c976915d; 8781ff606a5deae82e1660201d7478c34e3d7191; a04f1bc0b0a8bfc3cd4641c716d14888974661ad,9e91942c931395ae3aaea24b35422325302f63a2; 65536655311f2140f4a2b30f47874c6bff8a939a; 5b9effcee9c40bbb949b9da217decd7a8f2a44c5; b8ead1b980a359cc5b269d7c7ba1a2ad96f9a2c9; bf354d19771cc3be9588a0a881c0945e798ad906; 3427f5e070941522b00e9257a6288f0a8323d5d3; 478b1ba6a50c005d01d23e675a28767b33f4766c; 30a1525d4825977629c451407bcaf9ff74e5a504; ab1a7da676412fb32ae00107e5642aeef807f0d1; f3edbe3e005a3d4bc700fd7c35eca7a6ce45ff9e; 0d742e0f21b53e058aff4ac7ab20bc754cc8a736; 2e8e1e3762ba4a77c1ca1ceccf7c7589be8be170; 526831ff2a97181725cf48625ca944dc5df7d627; a6868e58f1761765859793a963ab9fa6368671f9; 78ce0c149860363bbbe34306c75a4454ad23828d; 48891d1206a040ffab06d58438bea73983e3af43; 1e4a68d78745c63a158d4fd0393e1f17b0bde9c2; 50586a7dea4ddc4966fe540bc6b07c5c31d7eda9; bda0c8643504eb74e9e857958e08b013d1e5d83f; 7d667b495eab364916993b756ddbd5e2616c0f9c; 5ab9c933dcc3341fe578d2cdbf82606df3b727a7; 17d01d94092942d99625e2df0614a03977f64960; 1cd3d11a1ba440cc7dc7e4d3c46ab5db7c472104; 750dfc49e453bd93e4041189bda31e41b3bd7088; e9407608b8955003e5a5d00c3bc7816d73d62922; 5e1e227a8c826940f3b68f782262d1052201b334; 772f5fca88de0f6f38116d73cc32e23efe780a10; 286fe785706af8d0176d36e6dcfea6b78a7582dc; c71dafe7b1050e7b073904ddb77de1afd3a3f59a; f6ccaf14a5765d2702d32a25e005ad3ea478ac15,Animals : an Open Access Journal from MDPI,9,
4a9034d5268d925d212c3b43f30e12c9ee85f3eb,Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of the Genetics of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (ais): Why Function Is the Key to Solving the Ais Puzzle,"Introduction From the many human studies that attempt to identify genes for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), the view emerging is that AIS is a complex genetic disorder with many predisposing genes exhibiting complex phenotypes through environmental interactions. Although advancements in genomic technology are transforming how we undertake genetic and genomic studies, only some success has been reached in deciphering complex diseases such as AIS. Moreover, the present challenge in AIS research is to understand the causative and correlative effects of discovered genetic perturbations. An important limitation to such investigations has been the absence of a method that can easily stratify patients with AIS. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a functional test that allows us to stratify patients with AIS into three functional subgroups, representing specific endophenotypes. Interestingly, in families with multiple cases of AIS, a specific endophenotype is shared among the affected family members, indicating that such a transmission is inherited. Moreover, increased vulnerability to AIS could be attributable to sustained exposure to osteopontin (OPN), a multifunctional cytokine that appears to be at the origin of the Gi-coupled receptor signalling dysfunction discovered in AIS. We examined the molecular expression profiles of patients with AIS and their response to OPN. Methods Osteoblasts isolated from patients with AIS were selected for each functional subgroup and compared with osteoblasts obtained from healthy matched controls. We used the latest gene chip human genome array Affymetrix (HuU133 Plus 2.0 array) that allows for the analysis of the expression level of 38 000 well characterised human genes. Raw data were normalised with robust multiarray analysis method. Statistical analysis was done by the EB method with FlexArray software. Selection criteria for in-depth analysis include the magnitude of change in expression (at least â–¡} 3-fold) and 5% false discovery rate as stringency selection. Validation of selected candidate genes was done by qPCR and at the protein level by Western blot and ELISA methods. Plasma OPN concentrations were measured by ELISA on a group of 683 consecutive patients with AIS and were compared with 262 healthy controls and 178 asymptomatic offspring, born from at least one scoliotic parent, and thus considered at risk of developing the disorder. The regulation of OPN signalling pathway in normal and AIS cells were validated in vitro by cellular dielectric spectroscopy (CDS). Results Of 38 000 human genes tested, we have found eight genes specifically associated with the functional subgroup 1, 16 genes with the functional subgroup 2, and 11 genes with the functional subgroup 3. Interestingly, only 19 genes were shared and affected to the same extent in all AIS functional subgroups exhibiting a similar curve pattern (double major), suggesting their role in the formation of this curve pattern. Indeed, most of these genes encode for regulatory proteins such as transcription factors regulating axial skeleton, somite development, and extracellular matrix proteins. Mean plasma OPN concentrations were significantly increased in patients with AIS and correlated with disease severity. Increased plasma OPN concentrations were also detected in the asymptomatic at-risk group, suggesting that these changes precede scoliosis onset. CDS experiments clearly showed that OPN exposure triggers a Gi-coupled receptor signalling dysfunction, which is exacerbated by oestrogens. Conclusions Our data further support our functional method of stratification of patients with AIS and allow the identification of genes triggering scoliosis onset versus those predisposing to the development of a specific curve pattern. Furthermore, our clinical and experimental data show that OPN is essential for scoliosis onset and curve progression, thus offering a first molecular concept to explain the pathomechanism leading to the asymmetrical growth of the spine in AIS.

Methods: This study derives from the material and bio-clinical data issued from a trial of autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation in patients with ALD (Hepatology 2011, A62), for which an informed consent was obtained in all cases. Transcriptome profiling was performed on snap liver frozen samples with Affymetrix GeneChip Human arrays containing 43134 transcripts. Differential gene expression was analyzed on liver tissue obtained at the 4-week follow-up visit after BMST (n=12) or after standard medical therapy alone (n=12). We also compared differentially expressed transcripts on baseline biopsy performed early after admission, according to the evolution of liver insufficiency at 3 months, irrespective of treatment allocation. We defined patients with a â‰¥ 3 points decrease in MELD compared to baseline value as â€œimproversâ€ (n=17), and those with less than 3 points decrease in MELD as â€œnon improversâ€ (n=13). Serum soluble receptor of TNF (STNF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were measured. Results: 1) Autologous BMST did not provide any clinical, biological or histological benefits compared to standard medical therapy (Hepatology 2011, A62). However, in stem cell treated patients, at a 5% false discovery rate, gene expression changes at 4 weeks of follow-up were predominantly associated with inflammation and immune chemotaxis (SAA, CXCL6, CXCL13, CCL19), as well as in hematopoietic cell protein (CD45), compared to patients with standard therapy alone. 2) Differentially expressed genes in baseline biopsy characterized the â€œimproversâ€ and the â€œnon-improversâ€. Genes involved in cell cycle mitosis (cyclin A and B, CDK1, CDC20) were upregulated in improvers compared to non-improvers, as well as genes involved in monocyte attraction, cytoskeleton motility and Wnt signaling (CXCL14, actin, collagen, CD68, Wnt11). Both serum STNF and HGF were also higher in improvers compared to non-improvers. Conclusion: In patients with decompensated ALD, the effect of BMST on liver tissue at 4 weeks of follow-up is limited to changes in genes linked with lympho-monocyte chemotaxis and one hematopoietic cell surface protein. The differentially expressed genes involved in cell proliferation at admission are associated with the clinical outcome, supporting the role of liver cell regeneration in the improvement of liver function.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Nicolas Lanthier"", ids = ""5083038""); list(name = ""Yves Chalandon"", ids = ""47810126""); list(name = ""Laura Rubbia-Brandt"", ids = ""1398175274""); list(name = ""Vincent Kindler"", ids = ""4334297""); list(name = ""Antoine Hadengue"", ids = ""4969719""); list(name = ""Laurent Spahr"", ids = ""5126038"")",,,Hepatology,56,

Exposure to toxic metals mostly occurs via contaminated food intake. Though toxic metals adversely affect reproductive health, common food sources among reproductive aged women are less understood. We addressed this gap among healthy premenopausal women, residing in western New York, 2005-2007.


Methods
Women enrolled in the BioCycle Study (nÂ =Â 249, mean age 27.4 years and body mass index [BMI] 24.1 kg/m2) completed a baseline food frequency questionnaire and provided blood samples to measure levels of mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd). We used linear regression to examine associations between food intake and log-transformed toxic metals, adjusted for age, BMI, race, smoking, physical activity, and intakes of total energy, protein, fat, and fiber. Models were adjusted for false discovery rate.


Results
Total fish intakeÂ â‰¥Â 1 serving per day was associated with 54.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 36.1, 75.9) higher Hg levels, compared to <1 serving. Specific fish intakes (i.e., canned tuna, fried fish, shellfish, white fish, and dark fish) were also associated with higher Hg levels. Though total meat intakes were not associated with Hg, intakes of lunch meat (28.1%), beef, pork, and lamb (21.0%), and chicken and turkey (43.5%) were associated with higher Hg levels, compared to no intake. Intakes of specific vegetables, including red pepper (17.4%), green beans (20.1%), summer (24.7%) and winter squash (19.3%), and garlic (18.5%) were associated with higher Hg. Total fruit intakeÂ â‰¥Â 1 serving per day was also positively associated with Hg (18.7%, 95% CI 4.8, 34.5), compared to <1 serving, particularly with bananas (21.6%, >0 versus no intake). Compared to no intake, green pepper (11.8%) and cauliflower (9.9%) were positively associated with Pb, whereas apples were inversely associated with Pb (-14.6%). No associations were found between food intakes and Cd in our data.


Conclusions
We found that intakes of certain foods are related to a higher blood level of toxic metals among reproductive aged women with metals level typical of the US population. Given the nutritional values of these food items, further research on food preparations (e.g., washing, packing) to reduce toxic metals exposure is needed.

926066d26e686ee25eb286ea016ef46669d422ed,Discovery of large genomic inversions using long range information,"AbstractBackgroundAlthough many algorithms are now available that aim to characterize different classes of structural variation, discovery of balanced rearrangements such as inversions remains an open problem. This is mainly due to the fact that breakpoints of such events typically lie within segmental duplications or common repeats, which reduces the mappability of short reads. The algorithms developed within the 1000 Genomes Project to identify inversions are limited to relatively short inversions, and there are currently no available algorithms to discover large inversions using high throughput sequencing technologies.ResultsHere we propose a novel algorithm, Valor, to discover large inversions using new sequencing methods that provide long range information such as 10X Genomics linked-read sequencing, pooled clone sequencing, or other similar technologies that we commonly refer to as long range sequencing. We demonstrate the utility of Valor using both pooled clone sequencing and 10X Genomics linked-read sequencing generated from the genome of an individual from the HapMap project (NA12878). We also provide a comprehensive comparison of Valor against several state-of-the-art structural variation discovery algorithms that use whole genome shotgun sequencing data.ConclusionsIn this paper, we show that Valor is able to accurately discover all previously identified and experimentally validated large inversions in the same genome with a low false discovery rate. Using Valor, we also predicted a novel inversion, which we validated using fluorescent in situ hybridization.

92ae2c3eb13e2736039200988a7e56851e2e76ee,Writing for the Sciences,"s and summaries. (descriptive, analytical) Condensing a larger work into an abstract or summary may be done for both general and professional readers. Posters. (investigative, analytical) Poster presentations require short, concise, and c le r narratives. Essays and response papers. (reflective) Sometimes one writes an opinion piece about an idea or a study. Popular writing and journalism. (descriptive) Scientists communicate with the general public in numerous ways. IV. Voice Generally, active voice is better than passive because it describes more c learly who did what and thus is easier to follow. Passive voice shifts emphasis away from the actor. I n experimental work, who did something is usually less important than what was done, however, so passive voice m ay be encountered more often for writing in science than in other disciplines, e.g., â€œthe sol ution was heated for 20 minutes.â€ Advice: Use active voice whenever possible, though some use of passive voice provides diversity in style while de-emphasizing the performer of the actions. V. Person In the past, the first person was used infrequently in science writing, but the use of â€œI â€ or â€œweâ€ is more common now because of increasing emphasis on clarity of expression. One may use the first person in writing whenever doing so improves comprehension of the reader. On the other hand, the first person should not be overused because science generally emphasizes the w ork, not the one who did it. Most experimental writing remains in the third person. In some scienc e disciplines, the first person is referred to as â€œweâ€ because a scientist s always working in the context of what others have done. VI. Tense Thereâ€™s a big difference in tense usage between writing in science and i n many other disciplines. One reads texts in the humanities as if the author is speaking to the reader in pre sent time, so one discusses the text in the present tense (what is known as the literary pres ent) even though the text was actually written in the past, e.g., â€œMilton writes...â€ But thereâ€™s a strong sense of timing in science: anything that took place in the past is generally described in past tense, whereas anything currently true is described in the present tense, as it is in all dis cip ines, e.g., â€œWatson & Crick (1953) proposed [past tense] a structure for DNA,â€ but â€œOur genetic her itag is encoded [present tense] in our DNA.â€ Most science writers donâ€™t use the present tense whe n writing about Writing in the Sciences, page 3 work someone else has done because any work that one reads was completed in the past, e. g., â€œTilman wrote that...â€ rather than â€œTilman writes that...â€ An exception is when a living personâ€™s views are well known, have been expressed over time, or have been written in multiple a rticles; then one might write â€œWilson argues [present tense] that the loss of biodiversit y...â€ Lab Reports. One should be careful about tense usage in writing lab reports. A lab handout might give directions as, â€œMake a solution of A and B,â€ or â€œWe will test the hy pothesis that...â€ In all cases, a lab report about an experiment shouldnâ€™t repeat the direct ions; it should report the action already taken, which means that the lab report should be written in t he past tense, e.g., â€œWe hypothesized that...â€ or â€œWe found that...â€ By the time the report is bein g written, all the work has been done! VII. Quotations, Citations, & Literature Cited The proper use and acknowledgement of sources is important in every discipline, and scie nce writers ensure that readers know the sources of ideas and information not their own. Quotations. Quotations are infrequent in science writing because the exact words used to describe an idea are rarely important. Instead, most sources are paraphra sed, not quoted. This is not the case in the humanities, in which the exact wording is often important; thus, quotations are much more frequent in those disciplines. It is hard to put someoneâ€™s else â€™s ideas in oneâ€™s own words, but that is what a science writer generally must do. Para phrasing forces a writer to extract and distill whatever he or she deems important fr om he outside source. Citations. Most writing in science uses the name-year system of citation. If the author is referred to in the sentence, then only the date is in parentheses. ...mosaic structure of habitats across a landscape (Connell, 1978). Wilson (1992) and Kerr et al. (1998) have argued for the importance of ... The page number is added to a science citation in the infrequent circumstance when a quotation is used, e.g., Gouldâ€™s argument for punctuated equilibrium is that â€œstasis is dataâ€ (1993:223). There are two reasons why page numbers arenâ€™t used routinely in the science c itation system: (1) The standard piece of science literature is a relatively short, technic al art le, not a book, so itâ€™s straight-forward to cite the whole thing; and (2) science writers paraphrase ideas rather than quote specific wording, so itâ€™s not important (or sometimes even possible) to refe r t a single statement. Space is at such a premium in the top journals Science and Nature that citations are by the citation-sequence (numbered) system. In these journals, too, the usual format for experimental reports is dropped in favor of a condensed presentation. Literature Cited. Science writing uses a Literature Cited section, not a bibliography. Every item listed must be cited specifically within the document or not included at all. D ifferent science disciplines and different journals require variants of the forms shown her e, w ich are in a standard form used by many biological journals.

Conciseness Brevity is important in all disciplines and is stressed in science. Get to the point. There is no room in any paper for sentences that donâ€™t contribute something significant to the paper. First sentences. The initial sentence of a paper is a clue to the quality of the thinking that went into the writing of the paper. Contrast these examples, which are the first s ntences of papers submitted by Hamilton students: The study entitled â€œBiochemical variation in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.): are rstrategists among deer genetically less variable than k-strateg ists?â€ was conducted by Gunther B. Hartl and Friedrich Reimoser in 1998. Carson and Wisotzkey (1989) reported evidence contrary to the conventional understanding of genetic drift in their study, â€œIncrease in genetic vari ance following a population bottleneck.â€ Notice that the first example has no significant idea in it; the sentence provides background information only. The second example, in contrast, has an idea that hooks the reader (something contrary or unexpected!). The entire paper then developed that idea. As another example, look at the first sentence of one of the most influential publica tions in the sciences in the 20 th century, Watson & Crick (1953). No dillydallying here. Note also use of the first person and active voice: We wish to suggest a structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid (D. N.A.). IX. Basic Advice Keep in mind the centrality of communication in science. Writers should aim to: Write with clarity, precision, and economy. Acknowledgements.

a9251c3f7ce8fe7703db5502c8298a5d5969cb56,Service environment link and false discovery rate correction: Methodological considerations in population and health facility surveys,"BACKGROUND
Geospatial data are important in monitoring many aspects of healthcare development. Geographically linking health facility data with population data is an important area of public health research. Examining healthcare problems spatially and hierarchically assists with efficient resource allocation and the monitoring and evaluation of service efficacy at different levels. This paper explored methodological issues associated with geographic data linkage, and the spatial and multilevel analyses that could be considered in analysing maternal health service data.


METHODS
The 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey and the 2014 Ethiopia Service Provision Assessment data were used. Two geographic data linking methods were used to link these two datasets. Administrative boundary link was used to link a sample of health facilities data with population survey data for analysing three areas of maternal health service use. Euclidean buffer link was used for a census of hospitals to analyse caesarean delivery use in Ethiopia. The Global Moran's I and the Getis-Ord Gi* statistics need to be carried out for identifying hot spots of maternal health service use in ArcGIS software. In addition to this, since the two datasets contain hierarchical data, a multilevel analysis was carried out to identify key determinants of maternal health service use in Ethiopia.


RESULTS
Administrative boundary link gave more types of health facilities and more maternal health services as compared to the Euclidean buffer link. Administrative boundary link is the method of choice in case of sampled health facilities. However, for a census of health facilities, the Euclidean buffer link is the appropriate choice as this provides cluster level service environment estimates, which the administrative boundary link does not. Applying a False Discovery Rate correction enables the identification of true spatial clusters of maternal health service use.


CONCLUSIONS
A service environment link minimizes the methodological issues associated with geographic data linkage. A False Discovery Rate correction needs to be used to account for multiple and dependent testing while carrying out local spatial statistics. Examining maternal health service use both spatially and hierarchically has tremendous importance for identifying geographic areas that need special emphasis and for intervention purposes.",2019,Medicine; Geography,"list(name = ""Teketo Kassaw Tegegne"", ids = ""5795149""); list(name = ""Catherine Chojenta"", ids = ""6047647""); list(name = ""Theodros Getachew"", ids = ""52386359""); list(name = ""Roger Smith"", ids = ""121567847""); list(name = ""Deborah Loxton"", ids = ""145930699"")",b988b346365feba8896137f6be906bf5d10e7850,c02a56c78071d56b84c5545beda914145ab3ee75; e19cb6b680d26027decb3bdb079ca8aab84aa8a4; 9047cb1f62d68538973a5a08294ef1b1757176df; 3e0fe7dc14e529ddb752c15638c08afa64f509cf; 9341db920fc1f7496c6745db4ee1f5c7d24a3d4b; 98cb79d9f6ae0757ffb8517c802813db97ae678e; 0cf3d2a2facc6bd0c8af2ed41df9fee5efdf7764; d49b059be444ac32e95a5e847177fb1c0681b39c; a08c3ee85e9072cfefbba5886de09357fc5a0786; 9578c3435a82cb0c56e7fe6589e1d31124a46f36; f121a0699f844d0cb13217f52785fb30c4c35203; 53234b8cb238cab6a2cbb27369cffd6236851093; 231ae0a47696bb348871aa99603774511fee71ae; 97002c194d086b13c1520c0c12eb09b75478ab52; 0b2bdb33357f7c6b6a9ac7d3ebf80bfb50263590; c20455cd33e3e572d417c3c90ba917f577196713; 373dd185a430a3906f8d457de109ce3150eb2d43; 0e8c4c2b405005d14496292f83b9f76519465b90; 23ccc4f1ecabcc978586f0bea9c559be20586183; 173816ec017d89c206743ecba9b271e2d53e7d76; 84881c1a5ca14d8568dcde82a2f9b180d11b6105; 0e1897ceccac26b531268028bc9ee06bbab1abb7; a61a9a4be59527469504b5f83540ad51a0c0a0d9; 60daefe829eaad360d0ce8d9590af7282e069508; c5fd9d7af34f6dca19e29ab06bc6723ec43fe1dd; c92d6fa1e30e12946c874e5a8b9aeee3c0155e29; da6cfa309c608466633ce38e6ae392d9cb8add14; 119881f30920d1ebe9a0a1ad72c012285430f486; 7b917845e8e3ea5bfbf1360f8846c025e96b4829; 0d2508b6bab10695dc64c6bf350b65a2f7ffe68b; 5ae4bb66988ac383c4f84060ceeef9a9228fa4d9; 5d2be1de654425da92456f9307ed14e76785894f; f3b3ce4b36318df166bd17e08933f02497b742bd; 5ee3fbd11239d9a50fbf00cb9792af6ac6640b6e; 3317663c5e7db99bf33a5d38370e077b40223229; 669844c480de7311bddda93d57175f324ddfadc9; 854ac7b62bdafd404f6f166c8c2497e7e1cf4f45; d4ff16773fe164d81ad9ab10af2ea8c0c9557ce0; 89843c1bccbdddeda11e05d5857da3e2f02579c4; 0d1c1dfa8b66e08f3bafa753f739d69ff663a9bc; 71d9c14aac9d948173d5d9e1e72238bd95eedd02; 21b9785a0454ee90c2d5e7a672b4133ec6291f56; 8282caaff86aa42b1712c8392df01cb290565290; 0ff968f08c2d5d179957793eeb27fb1d9f9b300d; 1cb681fbb70383afb806d887b96a020503beb72a; 4f26bfe2f5014dff02364f5504dfd29666ac918b; 54dfbf870327fa9a16442a193bbe61ee31746027; e4985140b5b45102c08123c36b353abfa2c46d0d; 7b362b11a8e9531048eeb1ae635a46220a4673db,PLoS ONE,14,

However, little is known about the cervical microbiome of HIV/HPV coinfected patients. HIV patients have a high prevalence of high-risk HPV and a greater chance of developing persistent HPV infection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the bacterial profiles of the cervical region of HIV/HPV coinfected patients, looking for a putative association of such profiles with cervical intraepithelial lesions. Methods We analysed 89 HIV+ cervical smear samples of women collected from 2010 to 2013. Samples have been categorised according to collection timepoint, CD4+ T-cell counts and cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN). The bacterial 16S rRNA gene was PCR-amplified and processed for next-generation sequencing in an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. After sequencing, reads were processed and compared against the 16S database. All bioinformatics analyses were carried out using QIIME. Results The most abundant bacterial species found was Lactobacillus iners. We found a negative association of the Moryella genus with CIN, independent of the collection timepoint.

7ff921a816e289682d3b122c85a96be6af23fd9e,Associations of Genetic Variations in MicroRNA Seed Regions With Acute Adverse Events and Survival in Patients With Rectal Cancer Receiving Postoperative Chemoradiation Therapy.,"PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the seed regions of microRNAs and acute adverse events (AEs) and survival in patients with rectal cancer receiving postoperative chemoradiation therapy.


METHODS AND MATERIALS
Eighteen SNPs were genotyped in 365 patients with rectal cancer receiving postoperative chemoradiation therapy. The associations between genotypes and AEs were estimated by odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which were computed by using multivariate logistic regression models. The hazard ratios and 95% CIs to assess the death of patients for different genotypes were calculated by Cox proportional regression models. Overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with different genotypes were estimated by Kaplan-Meier plots, and the statistical significance was determined by using the log-rank test.


RESULTS
In these patients, the most common grade â‰¥2 AEs were diarrhea (44.1%), leukopenia (29.6%), and dermatitis (18.9%). With false discovery rate correction, SNP rs2273626 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of grade â‰¥2 leukopenia (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31-0.74; P = .0009). In addition, SNP rs202195689 was associated with overall survival and disease-free survival in patients receiving postoperative chemoradiation therapy, with the hazard ratios for death being 2.02 (95% CI, 1.36-3.01; P = .0006) and 1.91 (95% CI, 1.36-2.70; P = .0002), respectively. However, no significant association between these SNPs and diarrhea and dermatitis was observed.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that rs2273626 and rs202195689 in microRNA seed regions might serve as independent biomarkers for predicting AEs and prognosisÂ in patients with rectal cancer receiving postoperative chemoradiation therapy.Â Independent replication of these findings is required to confirm these results.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ying Huang"", ids = ""38308154""); list(name = ""Yanru Feng"", ids = ""8061441""); list(name = ""Hua Nan Ren"", ids = ""3871344""); list(name = ""Meng Zhang"", ids = ""48985091""); list(name = ""Hong-Min Li"", ids = ""2577279""); list(name = ""Yan Qiao"", ids = ""144078880""); list(name = ""Ting Feng"", ids = ""50336464""); list(name = ""Jie Yang"", ids = ""49499492""); list(name = ""Weihu Wang"", ids = ""47825098""); list(name = ""Shulian Wang"", ids = ""67235452""); list(name = ""Yueping Liu"", ids = ""7895422""); list(name = ""Yongwen Song"", ids = ""4653834""); list(name = ""Yexiong Li"", ids = ""66508285""); list(name = ""Jing Bo Jin"", ids = ""145000882""); list(name = ""Wen Tan"", ids = ""144641351""); list(name = ""Dongxin Lin"", ids = ""1744961"")",07f48c1635baa61cf367f866a864365d20423cd1; 2743aae489a280feabc8dcde1a84845f0ca224ca,,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",100 4,"

However, resistance to sunitinib often occurred in patients receiving sunitinib treatment. On the other hand, 17-beta-estradiol (estrogen or E2) has been demonstrated to repress RCC growth in vitro, whether E2 can also affect the growth of sunitinib-resistant RCC remains unknown. Aims: In this study, the role of E2 in inhibiting sunitinib-resistant RCC growth and the underlining acting mechanisms was explored. Settings and Design: Sunitinib resistance was first induced in vitro in ACHN cells. The effect of E2 on cellular growth was then assayed. Label-free phosphoproteomics was also conducted. Subjects and Methods: ACHN cells were first challenged with 10-Î¼M sunitinib up to 4 months to induce drug resistance. Then, E2 at different concentrations were tested in both parental and sunitinib-resistant ACHN cells. To conduct phosphoproteomics study, the total cell lysates from E2-treated ACHN cells were harvested, trypsin digested, and the phosphopeptides were enriched by Fe-IMAC. Statistical Analysis Used: For comparing the E2-induced cell growth inhibition, Student's t-test was used, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. As for label-free phosphoproteomics, false discovery rate <0.01 and phosphosite possibility >0.75 were considered as positive identifications. Results: E2 at the physiological concentration, that is, 10 nM, can repress the cell growth in both parental and sunitinib-resistant ACHN cells. Further, label-free phosphoproteomics revealed that transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) pathway, cell cycle, and cytoskeleton bindings were enhanced in sunitinib-resistant cells but can be reduced by E2 treatment. On the other hand, programmed cell death and apoptosis were repressed in sunitinib-resistant cells, and E2 at 10 nM did not reverse the effect. We further validated the expression of SMAD3, an important molecule in TGF-Î² pathway, and found that SMAD3 decreased in sunitinib-resistant cells but can be upregulated by E2 treatment. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that E2 can inhibit the cell growth in sunitinib-resistant RCC cells at physiological concentration by upregulating SMAD3 in the TGF-Î² pathway, which may lead to growth inhibition in RCC.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei-Chi Ku"", ids = ""47107346""); list(name = ""Shaokuan Chen"", ids = ""7160470""); list(name = ""Chih-Ming Lin"", ids = ""50554540""); list(name = ""Chin Tang"", ids = ""146438354""); list(name = ""Yen-Chieh Wang"", ids = list())",,b4d0dfc23b73a54b1ffa7b29068a2b9ca60d4659; 3fd40721f304131ad61017a1cd0e52e32486ed57; bf38dd510ce32be4193dc94b95b91cfc00b60ba3; 6314d72d0838521a01b61cb2b359af099aa2d76a; 2f4d144e090eae198017ff42e190f35a4bd209e3; e69db985b77dd75aefd7d99856cd4207abf8c44e; c49e7e2133feea62b7302449d3988548245098dc; 6e1e6afb314f9c5a24d744252a30aa5efc313571; d0d1ab1b61bc1ca7da88069fad276304f8a9f5c6; f34c30f7836233da7277c2f2f2153004a10598a6; 1d6b73e5c627096f596bfc0b6e280648b1f14f1e; 9293403ce781cc9386b9b6583d39273f20f11ba1; f304d2397368168011098b51180acfaa7a196dfa; 0ef04cb990119457f212ba81724b579c1ecb892c; cca8365b2d6ce598a1491c7f6751119368411338; ea3e1ed073e254bb4d65d9d91a104bd41f969449; e1e8166d850ddb61303fcf29ba2610451d938896; 669c1cd380329f91d4696fad64fbab67883aa50d; 22c39907a14c7d7a77339f4812a8a11b9582a958; aa0aa1fd57f25bb39de673dd27167e0f6ea6b1eb; 558af0e9fbca07c5508c4db29af1c32a7d2b796d; cd2a4605d4f032c88627c13d7d93ba48a129b761; dc7f01616aea5d85e594d6b9d1113ca3bb292d28; e0234dfed113b5c3da6abd1a2b07f09e9b282acf; f3610694145627a4a329434c42cc4e116507a1eb; 0f8ea5e430cc50ae6a7ee33f7d86dd8dbd8934d2; 426d6245f96766a9fc992b6ed8c6116d6ae7a066,Urological Science,30,107 - 113

To investigate the genetic architecture underlying this viral disease, a set of 236 Chinese maize inbred lines was evaluated for resistance to MRDD in 2010 and 2011. Based on 41,101 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers with minor allele frequencies (MAF) greater than 5Â %, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was employed to identify genomic loci for resistance to MRDD. A total of 73 SNPs were found to be associated with resistance to MRDD at a significance threshold of -log10 (P)â€‰>â€‰4 controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at Î±â€‰=â€‰0.1. Fourteen of these SNPs were detected in both of the two environments tested. A total of 48 SNPs were identified in linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks containing candidate resistance genes, including protein kinase genes. Using the pedigree information and whole-genome SNP analysis of five highly resistant inbred lines derived from the hybrid â€˜P78599â€™, nine derivative fragments harbouring SNPs associated with MRDD resistance were detected. One 81.57Â Mb fragment in particular located in bin 8.03, which contained six SNPs associated with MRDD resistance, and included the major quantitative trait loci (QTL) that had been identified in the previous study. These results suggest that the SNPs and fragments associated with MRDD resistance, especially those in bin 8.03, could be used for fine mapping of resistance genes and developing resistant varieties in maize.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Changlin Liu"", ids = ""6349443""); list(name = ""Jianfeng Weng"", ids = ""38791852""); list(name = ""Degui Zhang"", ids = ""8335451""); list(name = ""Xiaocong Zhang"", ids = ""5792288""); list(name = ""Xiaojing Yang"", ids = ""2591451""); list(name = ""Liyu Shi"", ids = ""6707245""); list(name = ""Qingchang Meng"", ids = ""39127362""); list(name = ""Jianhua Yuan"", ids = ""46685350""); list(name = ""Xinping Guo"", ids = ""3266822""); list(name = ""Zhuanfang Hao"", ids = ""8247639""); list(name = ""Chuanxiao Xie"", ids = ""2429678""); list(name = ""Mingshun Li"", ids = ""3085552""); list(name = ""Xiaoke Ci"", ids = ""39732928""); list(name = ""Li Bai"", ids = ""143642695""); list(name = ""Xinhai Li"", ids = ""19840709""); list(name = ""Shihuang Zhang"", ids = ""7671568"")",e033334605d78510256bceff93fb29df87af7354; e6b3dabf61130d6208cc45b17eeda44b4fe0a119; 9e854f5ec2af15bc5ea098a060ced8eb6c8c97c0; 271609c1ffa588a05b80c75237bbf188e40e42bd; dc882a135e8fc4984d498488729388d7cb4554b8; a43859fbefa775b67a864c6982f10d7c24ccbc48; 86ad625a418f416723426a5b10e0315bcce129c8; e3ebdb987d191d4ed69ef9e52219408f839f439d; 621bae83074613922124ccc3e0b41a2939546517; 176567028917c684fdfc9e2a744424fabb3422f8; c7661e35629dc330e3f788fcf9905c28a52c0054; ed6ebbcd71cac40a23e5aa351050cfb37bc783eb; 5f96e29ecea63cd4de0612b6ad179b3c916aef1b; 31d09ddb9a59b9b74f502c5e8b616617e723f24f; 9aa43bbfdd50203051b41d287596fde916f52fdc; f41e1dda971a2428c1f863f859e411a043181a37,507523bd4b7f9feba867d37f13f6265917b2cb5f; 73f2650dfbfdce26714d711b4b8979f91a04f0a0; 8d44b6bbe5352cdf3e804479842719a79abf444a; 706ff010bec97dfb3a548676c214458afcc57b81; 0f854b489c3bbc0059653eef778f6ff5adb8734b; 7cb610e4bb0c6b8b49916943c3f32ca4d970ac78; 665a1ff35896765333eeffc975272fa34f5548b8; 34cf2b5e6ca1e77231a759d259b06e5e99695255; 6d5f7204f1b4d3518c264a06ffd5dd528fae2002; 7a2d5b2195d1d0f4e298251614f764685e306c80; 2946fa1cc63fed581f591e8b81b97dd8f5953f3e; 49a3039812d6c182b7c9c20dba6e46280b2447df; bca021e102e6d4de31950edfdb7bfb30d334366f; fa02f9123abacd5ba13d41e937d99c077da8d3f6; c850813fe8d6249806ead14f7fcad21e7932f21d; af9417d3a0778bafc9422c3f4a1cea906f828a3a; 37fb06e68cf46f6f8e8eaccc91ab86f3de06a14c; 9bae7376e4c05516947ae9f8c79559749749dec5; 43438b3dc761a36b3359e64f44248cd0edcaf363; 94bc9205b188c40374aa38caaf7ac5ab42b09f41; c73f528c7288d5eb6d6d1f75b59822d6b0847836; f997aab847c4d3d48ced0b6a1ea38047c81d2eb7; 7d2aeef3c4a9c43acaec15006b6a6ace7fe36bfe; 2b5c24c4c60b0579923a71391097c4d6f0062923; 97cf52771d850c792024da90227c33a92470d25f; dcd49fe8db46a4b331f43ebeeedf267600d4d79e; 8ed07475bef9c657a945e70700017c7abf9be1fa; 846a06d858e109ab43b78ee0e5380247ff20ed91; 79e1ef71e88e237bbd536e9c239b09c3d70982fc; 16ac4d1af24a6174b0a5e1b6491424291d2973bb; 51e3c2cefe978024a52eac17c6edb37fbfab5773; 0fc2c6689c42de2aeaaee9d85f1288a2443f9649; 336861147c14c5218e6203494406cbf43dcd0e1d; dfd548628a85b5aa26c2debef0b645ccf6d0e9c2; 25516a4258b9de1b93201c381a920e0cfd1fc47b; 5b4fd2ede919f4ae0d101bb8fdaa8083632b5676; eb14d1b728e562d337d67096f3d4ef0d86918d5e; 4096666dee3409b9ca1425d0897943c934db145a; 0a417a5b09afa0eda0d037559b5ec8cee1d17e30; 6428a4ef6b2376c1e47c7665c7d32aa9205dfff2; 02d4e1bbcda3b701e793cc5f625324a99d3cc8e1; bb5a41881bb56f18b0dd17915f1228c15d115ada; 2c3f0c34b58427bbd42c63bcea0a43c1271f33dc; 00e63bc3b58229c775f3ea2ad175b96040cba770; 3c6ceaf63520f0cb204c8200de75962802400271; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 92f2529251af27662252623b8ee0d2082d0e726a; 2d7e696094f050a0d694cf428b1027f5b15fe6c3; d2940ed67bb103d382fbe1344786bb7c9e4e9b4d; 9682e98e783729d19bbd697a0b75e963cfd4ebd2; 41392566c96360e5f29008dc9f09715f60759632; 4ef48fceda6cbff8e674944d137a70a7093ffffb; 4f86ac6903c26df7b3a03f11da0c715b87fb1f4f; 36d9ded73d049006c145444d06ab279de83c1217; 0fcda9afc0586bea5779679ac719cae784cf5ca9; 53a7ff6d159fabf05c73b33547f59b1315ad9558; de3d5bd837a23d07030d282b1737366d8a37a002; 0d203221dab822f828640e786d6af8af888c8da5; 9fe1aa65aa8421934b01b492f277afed05af8bd5,European Journal of Plant Pathology,139,205-216
ef8adcc408bd59e86db1ffb2f8effc8f4cbcdb40,"Imaging , Diagnosis , Prognosis Genetic Variation in In fl ammatory Pathways Is Related to Colorectal Cancer Survival","Purpose: Prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with systemic inflammation, and anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce both CRC incidence and mortality. Genetic variation in proinflammatory pathways can affect an individualâ€™s CRC risk. However, few studies have investigated the prognostic importance of this genetic variation in CRC patients. Experimental Design: We investigated the association between CRC survival and genetic variation in proinflammatory pathways among patients from the Puget Sound Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in five genes (PTGS-1, PTGS-2, MRP4, NFkB, and IkBKb). Vital status was ascertained through linkage to the National Death Index. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The false discovery rate method of Benjamini and Hochberg was applied to address multiple testing. Results: Four PTGS-1 variants were associated with CRC survival. One, G>A intron 9 (rs1213266), was associated with approximately 50% lower CRCmortality (HRAA/AG vs. GG1â„4 0.48; 95%CI, 0.25â€“0.93). Three variants, including L237M, resulted in significantly elevated CRC mortality risk, with HRs ranging from approximately 1.5 to 2.0. Two variants in IkBKb, including R526Q, were significantly associated with CRC survival. Correction for multiple testing indicated that variants in both PTGS-1 and IkBKb are reproducibly associated with CRC survival. Conclusion:Our findings suggest that genetic variation in proinflammatory pathwaysmay be important for CRC prognosis. This investigation represents one of the first descriptions of the relationship between inherited polymorphisms and mortality in CRC patients and provides a starting point for further research.

c7733a9e25955ca7cc2cd5e3b80f37204220dedf,Assessing the Performances of Protein Function Prediction Algorithms from the Perspectives of Identification Accuracy and False Discovery Rate,"The function of a protein is of great interest in the cutting-edge research of biological mechanisms, disease development and drug/target discovery. Besides experimental explorations, a variety of computational methods have been designed to predict protein function. Among these in silico methods, the prediction of BLAST is based on protein sequence similarity, while that of machine learning is also based on the sequence, but without the consideration of their similarity. This unique characteristic of machine learning makes it a good complement to BLAST and many other approaches in predicting the function of remotely relevant proteins and the homologous proteins of distinct function. However, the identification accuracies of these in silico methods and their false discovery rate have not yet been assessed so far, which greatly limits the usage of these algorithms. Herein, a comprehensive comparison of the performances among four popular prediction algorithms (BLAST, SVM, PNN and KNN) was conducted. In particular, the performance of these methods was systematically assessed by four standard statistical indexes based on the independent test datasets of 93 functional protein families defined by UniProtKB keywords. Moreover, the false discovery rates of these algorithms were evaluated by scanning the genomes of four representative model organisms (Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis). As a result, the substantially higher sensitivity of SVM and BLAST was observed compared with that of PNN and KNN. However, the machine learning algorithms (PNN, KNN and SVM) were found capable of substantially reducing the false discovery rate (SVM < PNN < KNN). In sum, this study comprehensively assessed the performance of four popular algorithms applied to protein function prediction, which could facilitate the selection of the most appropriate method in the related biomedical research.",2018,Computer Science;

893a9e58fe19750046757fb8d14163ed4860e82a,Unequal group variances in microarray data analyses,"MOTIVATION
In searching for differentially expressed (DE) genes in microarray data, we often observe a fraction of the genes to have unequal variability between groups. This is not an issue in large samples, where a valid test exists that uses individual variances separately. The problem arises in the small-sample setting, where the approximately valid Welch test lacks sensitivity, while the more sensitive moderated t-test assumes equal variance.


METHODS
We introduce a moderated Welch test (MWT) that allows unequal variance between groups. It is based on (i) weighting of pooled and unpooled standard errors and (ii) improved estimation of the gene-level variance that exploits the information from across the genes.


RESULTS
When a non-trivial proportion of genes has unequal variability, false discovery rate (FDR) estimates based on the standard t and moderated t-tests are often too optimistic, while the standard Welch test has low sensitivity. The MWT is shown to (i) perform better than the standard t, the standard Welch and the moderated t-tests when the variances are unequal between groups and (ii) perform similarly to the moderated t, and better than the standard t and Welch tests when the group variances are equal.

Background: Hydroxyurea (HU) is clinically effective in reducing the frequency of pain crises in adults and children with sickle cell disease (SCD). In addition to increased fetal hemoglobin production, HU is known to induce macrocytosis in sickle cell erythrocytes and prolong red cell survival. However, the precise mechanism by which HU produces its varied effects is unknown. Isoelectric focusing has been applied to characterize changes in the red cell membrane following exposure to HU, but this technique has limitations in its ability to identify differences in specific membrane proteins. Mass spectrometry (MS) provides another proteomic approach in analyzing red cell proteins in SCD.

Methods: Red blood cells were obtained from patients with SCD on HU therapy. After multiple wash and lysis steps, ghost membranes were obtained following ultracentrifugation. The membrane samples were then analyzed via tandem mass spectrometry and western immunoblot assay.

Results: In comparison to a normal control, patients with SCD on HU therapy were found to have significantly elevated levels of voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) by MS, using a false discovery rate of less than five percent. The application of a stringent threshold initially identified 346 protein candidates. Out of these 346 proteins, 125 contained multiple peptides which all passed quantitation data filters according to quality parameters. Within the set of 125 proteins, 4 proteins were significantly up-regulated (up to 50-fold) in patients with SCD on HU therapy. VDAC2 and VDAC3 are members of the eukaryotic mitochondrial porin family which form channels through the mitochondrial outer membrane allowing diffusion of small hydrophilic molecules. VDAC1 can be found in both the mitochondrial outer membrane and the plasma membrane, where it is involved in cell volume regulation and apoptosis.

Conclusions: Up-regulation of VDAC proteins may play an important role in altering the intracellular osmotic composition of the sickle cell erythrocyte resulting in decreased sickling and improved red cell survival in patients with SCD on HU therapy.

1feb20e21cf8d9137b881f4dac3a6ec663827029,Haplotype-based analysis of genes associated with risk of adverse skin reactions after radiotherapy in breast cancer patients.,"PURPOSE
To identify haplotypes of single nucleotide polymorphism markers associated with the risk of early adverse skin reactions (EASRs) after radiotherapy in breast cancer patients.


METHODS AND MATERIALS
DNA was sampled from 399 Japanese breast cancer patients who qualified for breast-conserving radiotherapy. Using the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria scoring system, version 2, the patients were grouped according to EASRs, defined as those occurring within 3 months of starting radiotherapy (Grade 1 or less, n = 290; Grade 2 or greater, n = 109). A total of 999 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 137 candidate genes for radiation susceptibility were genotyped, and the haplotype associations between groups were assessed.


RESULTS
The global haplotype association analysis (p < 0.05 and false discovery rate < 0.05) indicated that estimated haplotypes in six loci were associated with EASR risk. A comparison of the risk haplotype with the most frequent haplotype in each locus showed haplotype GGTT in CD44 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-4.43) resulted in a significantly greater EASR risk. Five haplotypes, CG in MAD2L2 (OR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35-0.87), GTTG in PTTG1 (OR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24-0.96), TCC (OR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26-0.89) and CCG (OR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.27-0.92) in RAD9A, and GCT in LIG3 (OR = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22-0.93) were associated with a reduced EASR risk. No significant risk haplotype was observed in REV3L.


CONCLUSION
Individual radiosensitivity can be partly determined by these haplotypes in multiple loci. Our findings may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the genetic variation in radiation sensitivity and resistance among breast cancer patients.",2007,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tomo Suga"", ids = ""4650721""); list(name = ""Atsuko Ishikawa"", ids = ""4509159""); list(name = ""Masakazu Kohda"", ids = ""34991214""); list(name = ""Yoshimi Otsuka"", ids = ""144821507""); list(name = ""Shigeru Yamada"", ids = ""1751106""); list(name = ""Naohito Yamamoto"", ids = ""6780500""); list(name = ""Yuta Shibamoto"", ids = ""2232683""); list(name = ""Yoshihiro Ogawa"", ids = ""3509581""); list(name = ""Kuninori Nomura"", ids = ""49356062""); list(name = ""Keizen Sho"", ids = ""36553967""); list(name = ""Motoko Omura"", ids = ""32011335""); list(name = ""Kenji Sekiguchi"", ids = ""8587571""); list(name = ""Yuzo Kikuchi"", ids = ""50700794""); list(name = ""Yuichi Michikawa"", ids = ""5221640""); list(name = ""Shuhei Noda"", ids = ""46924744""); list(name = ""Masashi Sagara"", ids = ""47312384""); list(name = ""Jun Ohashi"", ids = ""4650035""); list(name = ""Shinji Yoshinaga"", ids = ""5560768""); list(name = ""Jun-etsu Mizoe"", ids = ""33577727""); list(name = ""Hirohiko Tsujii"", ids = ""1830428""); list(name = ""Mayumi Iwakawa"", ids = ""6750248""); list(name = ""Takashi Imai"", ids = ""2484177"")",968bec6a31dba03980d568bc932d254735830b6b; 0cbc7345b8a9bf0b6d4f4398c21ee8dc6e9e6cea; 5c5ade64374429f9bc9af433e1769036ec436668; e05a74ac9b49cbd772db61d08f589b3f43813511; 83e503c9526066476f44c68f15e1a30b71b4cfef; c40502fbb898efcb732ef1fb86c913dc16c9fedd; 852affdf829965bf767219195ede071e79b3c4f4; 8537f9dbf315211548ab567b4ad2c6e32e8c0dc5; 894e38611f73d76b34c1e45dc130688d0b3be931; af8381e0238b904ad0b34751ae3fc703e4273086; 6248e199b1d34b01a5e54387f88cbefb1276dcd8; a4d75e749a859272d42f5f42fe06b05ceb5028d7; 321227abf87edb768c5bb71dec0e37c8a682ff1b; d125b2ad5f84de9061f07c7bfc8a2adbb1539943; 5f2ce667efdac09c2ae3ffff83894e3d6e91970f; dfd6dc0273ab57fbf71c93077428146c40ddef7f; d657f2e057b86fb0481a1eb91964584bda3839bb; 9d8107d34d7fcbc104caea9ab8fe82877da2092c; fedd4c2ce4ce2b10fb7ea2eeef0d4ec87f5dbb5b; a61cb292ef161ac179efd4bf625e38c9481a72e3; 41ca9b632875e32afc504f6674e5793107a20b0a; 9b6b928621c02d3b38de70e5caca9abfd4d14c48; c053ffc37d5a7acebacc0e65895b3185f8b3d2e9; 566f68f530b90065022f249935a1063e184e03e6; 25d289cbc3c0724758630b1da6a16ed4c04df45a; f7d6701c38298c387806cad8ccf18451de33fa00; c1f8ddf4f555ef3eb9e91daa5615f01b1d057eb2; 06dd7e9574e20787f21512b35f3bc30b24072073; acd164b9383b72461a45b37f79e8dc57ebdc11be; 8020fca372c27e9e7cb44de5e04d719a4a95f818; c32412bcc5c3635ab1b7b934bd9934305c00e701; c7b72aa213e566223300e97c51cb0bf19b6e837b; ee740f67bbce09bf877c0cfad56484177b75c29b,,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",69 3,"

e7170e345d54424c65b9833dc4376666f913b8d4,Reduction of Interhemispheric Functional Connectivity in Sensorimotor and Visual Information Processing Pathways in Schizophrenia,"BACKGROUND
Previous studies have demonstrated interhemispheric functional connectivity alterations in schizophrenia. However, the relationship between these alterations and the disease state of schizophrenia is largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate this relationship using voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) method.


METHODS
This study enrolled 36 schizophrenia patients with complete remission, 58 schizophrenia patients with incomplete remission and 55 healthy controls. The VMHC was calculated based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Differences in VMHC among three groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance. A brain region with a significant difference in VMHC was defined as a region of interest (ROI), and the mean VMHC value in the ROI was extracted for the post hoc analysis, i.e., pair-wise comparisons across the three groups.


RESULTS
VMHC in the visual region (inferior occipital and fusiform gyri) and the sensorimotor region (paracentral lobule) showed significant differences among the three groups (P < 0.05, a false discovery rate method corrected). Pair-wise comparisons in the post hoc analysis showed that VMHC of the visual and sensorimotor regions in schizophrenia patients with complete remission and incomplete remission was lower than that in healthy controls (P < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected); however, there was no significant difference between the two patient subgroups.


CONCLUSIONS
Interhemispheric functional connectivity in the sensorimotor and visual processing pathways was reduced in patients with schizophrenia, but this reduction was unrelated to the disease state; thus, this reduction may serve as a trait marker of schizophrenia.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xu Lang"", ids = ""6381791""); list(name = ""Le Wang"", ids = ""48169744""); list(name = ""Chuanjun Zhuo"", ids = ""40403322""); list(name = ""Feng Jia"", ids = ""144077101""); list(name = ""Li-na Wang"", ids = ""39386513""); list(name = ""Chun-li Wang"", ids = ""48586661"")",ea488c0660a9400aecd78ec5ef4f5ea0b84d0290; 61aa93aad829250064c9239b38f97a48348c4fc6; a76b567d94956587cee28b745655b9b3ce004e1a; 5a174eee51d597ad77e3f5d7ecc59bb3888a71ca; 2ce2ae68fc2763ba7a2ba3956e21fa3d5d0c94f3; 764d2a6d5e367355f3c47c8d614a1039fddea5ed; 8bf72eb013e4b5d09356dc8c8ec03d722b940e61,a14b2935c29c914d05d98cf44c15aad9987bc6af; 1a7381ee37e349dc64cb6144224607b1bfab205c; 8cec3168f9900fb50475a0bd60e9034738ef9674; c07e01924e7c92028f80aa57bb8934383c2c4d30; 983d9711982d714034612f807740c77d5719a2d5; aba40819d83aae295677d8fece8b6de3ddf728af; a15442a5f60723e20d32390260a422300311127f; 165ba5d419ff2c4b07a8194e3100d45ed443ef39; 2650911f28fc7ece5be6973310f74d9539e8b1ca; fc1d568021431e1fd9b4ef2623e5b706f4240239; bf6276ebd6a2d9a887090004f118073a88a4730b; 743f0e44408696f85a4f1499654b530da90ebf14; 345ee55fa8419ee83fbb41cf63cfe1b9a3d625cd; abe0465f603c9be7aa74228293574fb9569e95ad; f897b6b1181486712fb88e9f9d575c4c072fb6b6; 2c5f52cf986117042b625759f139a3d9f5d070a6; 7d7ed7f97585bff376226a194e6d9f35b0898f9b; 693b301c470b3721221356e7599eea0c0a21d5a2; 14bda5d2082a100c72b3599022f37bc885c9b2a5; b0c2e11764940db4248c90bb576863ad5eb6f4b0; 98344da946652d765346a9666afab29d34dff233; edf3d9602b284bffe4e6e364231993c190f61d5f,Chinese Medical Journal,129,2422 - 2426
b93423dbefe27866057c1aa11cf88c9ae3d950d6,"Gene Expression Signatures for Tumor Progression , Tumor Subtype , and Tumor Thickness in Laser-MicrodissectedMelanoma Tissues","Purpose:To better understand the molecular mechanisms of malignant melanoma progression and metastasis, gene expression profiling was done of primary melanomas and melanoma metastases. Experimental Design: Tumor cell ^ specific gene expression in 19 primary melanomas and 22 melanomametastases was analyzed using oligonucleotide microarrays after laser-capturemicrodissection of melanoma cells. Statistical analysis was done by random permutation analysis and support vector machines. Microarray data were further validated by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Results: Overall, 308 genes were identified that showed significant differential expression betweenprimarymelanomasandmelanomametastases (false discovery rateV0.05).Significantly overrepresented gene ontology categories in the list of 308 genes were cell cycle regulation, mitosis, cell communication, and cell adhesion. Overall, 47 genes showedup-regulation inmetastases. These included Cdc6, Cdk1, septin 6, mitosin, kinesin family member 2C, osteopontin, and fibronectin. Down-regulated genes included E-cadherin, fibroblast growth factor binding protein, and desmocollin 1 and desmocollin 3, stratifin/14-3-3r, and the chemokine CCL27. Using support vector machine analysis of gene expression data, a performance of >85% correct classifications for primary melanomas andmetastases was reached. Further analysis showed that subtypes of primary melanomas displayed characteristic gene expression patterns, as do thin tumors (V1.0 mm Breslow thickness) compared with intermediate and thick tumors (>2.0 mm Breslow thickness). Conclusions: Taken together, this large-scale gene expression study of malignant melanoma identified molecular signatures related to metastasis, melanoma subtypes, and tumor thickness. These findings not only provide deeper insights into the pathogenesis of melanoma progression but may also guide future research on innovative treatments. The incidence of malignant melanoma is steadily increasing with a present lifetime risk of 1 in 75 among the Caucasian population (1). The underlying factors for this phenomenon are largely unknown. After diagnosis of malignant melanoma, the single most important factor for the prognosis of melanoma patients is vertical tumor thickness as described earlier by Breslow (2). It could be shown that tumors of a few-millimeter thickness already show a high potential for metastasis with a fatal outcome for the patient. In the metastatic stage, melanoma patients have only few treatment options, consisting of monochemotherapies with dacarbazine (DTIC) or temozolomide, or polychemotherapy regimens combining DTIC with other chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin and 1,3bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (3â€“5). Although significant clinical response rates were achieved by these treatment modalities, there was no substantial effect on the overall survival of these patients. Unfortunately, little is known about factors that contribute to the process of melanoma progression and metastasis. In recent years, DNA microarray technology has fostered hopes for a more complete understanding of the mechanisms of tumor progression and metastasis in a variety of tumors, including malignant melanoma (6â€“8). A series of studies done on colon carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and breast carcinoma showed tumor-specific gene expression compared with normal tissues (9â€“13). More recently, a comprehensive microarray study on metastasisrelated gene expression analyzed different primary tumors from breast adenocarcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma and Human Cancer Biology Authorsâ€™ Affiliations: Department of Computational Molecular Biology, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, Germany and Institute of Immunology and Department of Dermatology and Venereology, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany Received 7/24/06; revised10/5/06; accepted11/28/06.

Â© 2007 American Association for clincancerres.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from medulloblastoma, and metastases of the same tumor types (14). A universal molecular signature for metastasis was suggested. Among the 17 signature genes were important mediators for the interaction of tumor cells with the extracellular matrix, such as type I collagen a1/a2 . A large-scale gene expression study based on the analysis of melanoma cell lines of different aggressiveness was presented by Clark et al. (15). RhoC, a member of the family of Rho GTPases, was shown to be highly expressed in metastatic melanoma cells, when compared with their nonmetastatic counterparts of the same genetic background. The differences in gene expression between cell lines of both stages were most significant for genes involved in extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton organization [e.g., fibronectin, collagen subunits a2(I) and a1(III), matrix Gla protein, fibromodullin, biglycan, and thymosin b4]. To identify a metastatic phenotype in primary melanomas that might help to predict the clinical outcome of melanoma patients, Bittner et al. analyzed biopsies from primary melanomas and melanoma metastases (16). Based on biostatistical and functional analyses, two major melanoma clusters were identified. Cluster I contained less aggressive melanoma tissues, and cluster II contained highly aggressive melanoma tissues. Cluster I showed reduced expression for integrin h1, integrin h3, syndecan, vinculin, and fibronectin. This study further underlined the particular role of cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix molecules for melanoma progression. A more recent study based on gene expression patterns of 58 primary melanomas showed that gene expression patterns in primary tumors may indeed help to predict the clinical outcome of melanoma patients (17). Gene expression patterns in primary tumors differed between patients with a 4-year distant metastasis-free survival from those who developed metastases within this time. A large series of molecules with enhanced expression in the bad prognosis group belonged to the functional groups of cell cycle regulation, mitosis, and DNA replication, such as Cdc2, Cdc6, CENPF, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. A comprehensive study on different stages of malignant melanoma development was published recently, analyzing specimens from benign melanocytic nevi, primary melanomas, and melanoma metastases (18). A major finding of this study was the identification of two different gene patterns found in metastases reflecting those in vertical or radial growth phase cells of primary melanomas. These findings argue for a metastatic gene pattern present in a subtype of primary tumors. In the present report, the expression of 22,283 probe sets was analyzed in a series of laser-microdissected tissues from 41 primary melanomas and melanoma metastases using oligonucleotide microarrays. Overall, 389 probe sets (representing 308 different genes) were identified that showed significant differential expression between both disease stages. A predictive diagnostic model [support vector machine (SVM)] for discriminating primary tumors and metastases was trained, and a performance of >85% correct classifications was reached in cross-validation. Materials and Methods Tissue specimens. For microarray analyses, biopsy material of 19 primary melanomas and 22 cutaneous melanoma metastases was obtained from 41 different patients after surgical excision of tumors. The vertical tumor thickness of primary melanomas ranged from 0.38 to 11.00 mm according to Breslow (2), including one in situ melanoma. A complete list with detailed information about primary melanoma samples including thicknesses of biopsies is given in Supplementary Table S1A. Immunohistochemistry was done on an independent set of 20 primary melanomas and 20 melanoma metastases from either archival paraffin-embedded or frozen material, depending on the antibodies used for immunostaining. The vertical tumor thickness of these primary melanomas ranged from 0.40 to 12.20 mm according to Breslow. Metastatic lesions in both groups were cutaneous or s.c. metastases. The presented study was approved by the local Ethic Committee at the University of Rostock, and informed consent for microarray analyses of tumors was obtained from all patients. Laser-capture microdissection of tumor tissue. Laser-capture microdissection was done as described by Bonner et al. (19). Cryopreparations of tumor specimens were cut into sections of 10-Am thickness and put onto slides covered with a transparent plastic foil. Sections were then stained using conventional H&E stain. Twenty to 30 sections of each tumor (primary tumors or metastases) were prepared. These were subjected to laser-capture microdissection using a laser-capture microdissection Facility (P.A.L.M. Microlaser Technologies, Bernried, Germany). Melanoma cells were microdissected under microscopic control by an experienced histopathologist. For the analysis of primary melanomas, the entire thickness of each tumor was microdissected. This included intraepidermal melanoma cells, when these cells were part of clearly demarca",2007,,"list(name = ""JochenJaeger"", ids = list()); list(name = ""Dirk Koczan"", ids = ""3007917""); list(name = ""Hans-JÃ¼rgen Thiesen"", ids = ""3256988""); list(name = ""Soibrahim Ibrahim"", ids = ""35224330""); list(name = ""Gerd Gross"", ids = ""152468929""); list(name = ""Rainer Spang"", ids = ""48692032""); list(name = ""A Kunz"", ids = ""143933062"")",3a80e4de09b46816fee2c6c754a09eeed2cef078; 7a264881ee2f385093963ad0f02022d593464586; 6f0c22b2bf3db60302894949a47c040c98816c6a; abea9992a2f27d34cdfe9eaa44d9593c018b1ecb; c7aef2e261ad8f66811b5e602f8d3017f234735c; 3acededf11360e62b1f073d030eac24bf995c47a; 8b33d9264c5992301a8b09494970432c577a2048,5fd2f6a91f45265c233c4de0a26fbec561e2b23d; 52b7bf3ba59b31f362aa07f957f1543a29a4279e; 6b94cab75c88d138e38cc25e3159322231680a63; 176bfc3c36940078c2a34a35d9b66db8a1ca118a; e2b2d49d7efb508b5de33111859d141b46414a39; 037c108e3832f51114e22839ee7df4a7ed95cd6d; f03becb0df0b4f445cf51ad3a55ba4e56b83e38c; 60fd00550b3b46c1b5adde9a994fbbc064d9fd67; d3ca13f8eb5db4c4eb81ae7977dcdd1a3a21ecaa; 6e57966a0f03839153552d4a5ca9e8d2fc9315b6; 6e436b11eab90258229643cd47861f430f00080c; 024f9ec34d9256d48afe591b1bc15b75a331af1c; f6bef36bcc5bf2f5ab513c06221a0e1678db5277; 1a9b404ac636a56b439cd573903b829ea2df2d46; 0c5f19ca1a60cfe29f7ca6f28710702b898f4d82; 8c8dd1bc46ae1412ab778c9f760959014d7dc213; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; d364572f553be6344b697a8cab5d07e2246db5e9; b5e06f5a986d9a2282b5718617454928c00d1b91; c82acf0ba33a3ba8ba3146208c87c3adbc9c5cc2; 74ec47a29e1f37fc264b3d811587b99d0047df5e; 443d28fc68029a0a9fa68ce82826b5e9b2a13682; c3752ada33240cc58bef8e1d973dbbc338c1646f; 6ae959348b3d926507191693d861e404f7a968b9; 4df1ee2955b90258c8aeb25d032c71c4c21e042f; 98bc42fb6c222e8af9bb91f967f896c860e8f752; a02f2390f562d212694fc840514f1632ff18d450; a86171e13f84fe32212dd7fb6a1c31a34a47155f; 9c75ac2e89854fa4e73afee8921404c774dd9ba9; c822993f4c2cec0221ccaf4c4a1a96df1f39452f; 938e5d6de325d08861c5e465b27b608e72937b68; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; cb642de8d41ede978669e7badf7743f7451f8838; 0c856b837fa684eac40f9c1ed644d6cda7eb7578; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; ebd244c4ea6d47c9ab89772c7396b2a1025bff12; 2c65c6758894d10a912e923fd37d546fc275b895; 07160a69d4c32c7cee628711cc42049320746c6f; 6f2738aac7c8579d031fc3bb06888fb7bc29757a,,,
3b3384926168e7af70d71e65073088024e28278f,A Scalable Approach for Protein False Discovery Rate Estimation in Large Proteomic Data Sets.,"Calculating the number of confidently identified proteins and estimating false discovery rate (FDR) is a challenge when analyzing very large proteomic data sets such as entire human proteomes. Biological and technical heterogeneity in proteomic experiments further add to the challenge and there are strong differences in opinion regarding the conceptual validity of a protein FDR and no consensus regarding the methodology for protein FDR determination. There are also limitations inherent to the widely used classic target-decoy strategy that particularly show when analyzing very large data sets and that lead to a strong over-representation of decoy identifications. In this study, we investigated the merits of the classic, as well as a novel target-decoy-based protein FDR estimation approach, taking advantage of a heterogeneous data collection comprised of âˆ¼19,000 LC-MS/MS runs deposited in ProteomicsDB (https://www.proteomicsdb.org). The ""picked"" protein FDR approach treats target and decoy sequences of the same protein as a pair rather than as individual entities and chooses either the target or the decoy sequence depending on which receives the highest score. We investigated the performance of this approach in combination with q-value based peptide scoring to normalize sample-, instrument-, and search engine-specific differences. The ""picked"" target-decoy strategy performed best when protein scoring was based on the best peptide q-value for each protein yielding a stable number of true positive protein identifications over a wide range of q-value thresholds. We show that this simple and unbiased strategy eliminates a conceptual issue in the commonly used ""classic"" protein FDR approach that causes overprediction of false-positive protein identification in large data sets. The approach scales from small to very large data sets without losing performance, consistently increases the number of true-positive protein identifications and is readily implemented in proteomics analysis software.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mikhail M.

ed9716278a7dedc4699622c5a0a9a3ca76740728,Robust inference with knockoffs,"We consider the variable selection problem, which seeks to identify important variables influencing a response $Y$ out of many candidate features $X_1, \ldots, X_p$. We wish to do so while offering finite-sample guarantees about the fraction of false positives - selected variables $X_j$ that in fact have no effect on $Y$ after the other features are known. When the number of features $p$ is large (perhaps even larger than the sample size $n$), and we have no prior knowledge regarding the type of dependence between $Y$ and $X$, the model-X knockoffs framework nonetheless allows us to select a model with a guaranteed bound on the false discovery rate, as long as the distribution of the feature vector $X=(X_1,\dots,X_p)$ is exactly known. This model selection procedure operates by constructing ""knockoff copies'"" of each of the $p$ features, which are then used as a control group to ensure that the model selection algorithm is not choosing too many irrelevant features. In this work, we study the practical setting where the distribution of $X$ could only be estimated, rather than known exactly, and the knockoff copies of the $X_j$'s are therefore constructed somewhat incorrectly. Our results, which are free of any modeling assumption whatsoever, show that the resulting model selection procedure incurs an inflation of the false discovery rate that is proportional to our errors in estimating the distribution of each feature $X_j$ conditional on the remaining features $\{X_k:k\neq j\}$.

dc9ca9bc7f3b234da806f0afc6acb5178a0b3d65,Association of a risk allele of ANK3 with cognitive performance and cortical thickness in patients with first-episode psychosis.,"BACKGROUND
The gene ANK3 is implicated in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The present study investigated the influence of this gene on cognitive performance and brain structure among individuals with first-episode psychosis (FEP). The brief illness duration of an FEP sample makes it well suited for studying the effects of genetic variation.


METHODS
We genotyped 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs1938526 and rs10994336) in ANK3 in patients with FEP. Multivariate analysis of variance compared risk allele carriers and noncarriers on 6 domains of cognition consistent with MATRICS consensus. A subsample of 82 patients was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. We compared brain structure between carriers and noncarriers using cortical thickness analysis and voxel-based morphometry on white matter.


RESULTS
In the 173 patients with FEP included in our study, rs1938526 and rs10994336 were in very high linkage disequilibrium (d' = 0.95), and analyses were therefore only carried out on the SNP (rs1938526) with the highest minor allele frequency (G). Allele G of rs1938526, was associated with lower cognitive performance across domains (F6,164 = 2.38, p = 0.030) and significantly lower scores on the domains of verbal memory (p = 0.015), working memory (p = 0.006) and attention (p = 0.019). The significant effects of this SNP on cognition were not maintained when controlling for IQ. Cortical thinning was observed in risk allele carriers at diverse sites across cortical lobes bilaterally at a threshold of p < 0.01, false discovery rate-corrected. Risk-allele carriers did not show any regions of reduced white matter volume.


LIMITATIONS
The sample size is modest given that a low-frequency variant was being examined.


CONCLUSION
The ANK3 risk allele rs1938526 appears to be associated with general cognitive impairment and widespread cortical thinning in patients with FEP.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Clifford M.

We aimed to study the potential influence of tumour blood flow -obtained from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI)- in the metabolomic profiles of endometrial tumours.


Methods
Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry established the metabolomic profile of endometrial cancer lesions exhibiting high (n=12) or low (n=14) tumour blood flow at DCE-MRI. Univariate and multivariate statistics (ortho-PLS-DA, a random forest (RF) classifier and hierarchical clustering) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to establish a panel for potentially discriminating tumours with high versus low blood flow.


Results
Tumour blood flow is associated with specific metabolomic signatures. Ortho-PLS-DA and RF classifier resulted in well-defined clusters with an out-of-bag error lower than 8%. We found 28 statistically significant molecules (False Discovery Rate corrected p<0.05). Based on exact mass, retention time and isotopic distribution we identified 9 molecules including resolvin D and specific lysophospholipids associated with blood flow, and hence with a potentially regulatory role relevant in endometrial cancer.


Conclusions
Tumour flow parameters at DCE-MRI quantifying vascular tumour characteristics are reflected in corresponding metabolomics signatures and highlight disease mechanisms that may be targetable by novel therapies.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""NÃºria Eritja"", ids = ""6105036""); list(name = ""Mariona JovÃ©"", ids = ""145108391""); list(name = ""Kristine E.

Wally Gilks Email: wally.gilks@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk Medical Research Council, Cambridge, UK Bioinformatics is the computational arm of genomics. In its broadest sense, genomics is the study of the genome (the DNA of cells), and of the biology related to it. The rapid expansion of genome sequence databases, including that of the whole human genome, and large databases of results from high-throughput experiments involving DNA, RNA, proteins and other biomolecules, have propelled bioinformatics into a front-line area of research. Now, most biological research involves frequent use of these huge databases, and their associated bioinformatic tools. Genomics and genetics are related fields, with no clear separation. Nevertheless, it can be said that genetics approaches the study of biology through observing and manipulating genome-level differences between individuals within a species, whilst genomics focuses increasingly on finding similarities or patterns within and between the genomes of different species. Statisticians have a played a pivotal role in the development of genetics, but are not seen as major players in the development of genomics. I will review some of the main areas of bioinformatics research, and the contribution that statisticians have so far made. I will argue that the status of the statistician in the front line of biomedical research depends crucially on our greater involvement in bioinformatics, but that we face considerable difficulties in meeting this challenge.

2ae0981b695f9c0cce1b2bf4d864c465b8afdac8,Effect of mass spectrometric parameters on peptide and protein identification rates for shotgun proteomic experiments on an LTQ-orbitrap mass analyzer.,"The success of a shotgun proteomic experiment relies heavily on the performance and optimization of both the LC and the MS systems. Despite this, little consideration has, so far, been given to the importance of evaluating and optimizing the MS instrument settings during data-dependent acquisition mode. Moreover, during data-dependent acquisition, the users have to decide and choose among various MS parameters and settings, making a successful analysis even more challenging. We have systematically investigated and evaluated the effect of enabling and disabling the preview mode for FTMS scan, the number of microscans per MS/MS scan, the number of MS/MS events, the maximum ion injection time for MS/MS, and the automatic gain control target value for MS and MS/MS events on protein and peptide identification rates on an LTQ-Orbitrap using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome. Our investigations aimed to assess the significance of each MS parameter to improve proteome analysis and coverage. We observed that higher identification rates were obtained at lower ion injection times i.e. 50-150â€‰ms, by performing one microscan and 12-15 MS/MS events. In terms of ion population, optimal automatic gain control target values were at 5Ã—10(5) -1Ã—10(6) ions for MS and 3Ã—10(3) -1Ã—10(4) ions for MS/MS. The preview mode scan had a minimal effect on identification rates. Using optimized MS settings, we identified 1038 (Â±2.3%) protein groups with a minimum of two peptide identifications and an estimated false discovery rate of âˆ¼1% at both peptide and protein level in a 160-min LC-MS/MS analysis.",2012,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Anastasia Kalli"", ids = ""31460329""); list(name = ""Sonja Hess"", ids = ""2356269"")",390d58d8e264d1c6826cef752b3b29400c617dfb; 66313b88e984aee8d280bc7346db87bedd862d54; c09dade3699efd1da8125a8ff19727cdf01f01c6; 62e32d0039de6689aa65e2c08b7d7aa3135c2608; 05eca23eaf84bd0e10830416996bcdd2c799c8f3; 4356a9f604d0a7276a4caa109714b1917ec30bcd; 6da04ace38a2f87df6e8e7dd33a595bae3867fa7; de16e98b259ccb43d306d777ebe42ea01953c5cf; 9508f80cf33763af5e849ed71595569a3ad75038; eb52315e6cd4816fd82297dcfe6b388842ecd5a9; 33b89b968c28dd09a61d8f661c015a7fdfb5002a; dc540c99639c0ddcd7cce1ffb6cc820a69badd16; 9302d63b526568884cf03f124b10e89f11394f86; fadcc3ad0452b301e44c631190eaedee55c5343c; eddc42cfe9692bbf71f418ac01e10a046a1aee41; 7b3bc8a6d71c30f63d931deba60c9c943b13182d; 21354a60feca39c72537a0aa40daf09c811a6719; 47c1b2aa200252a7d3646c3894026e6186e18419; 4bdec966656e29f012aa30a07e73be49b700332d; dc48bd7e3d4f213569649786c573b0f74d6320c9; e5a7008c60559d74c89ef7f7991c80ed95ec3569; b50cfe26bf0f79d5ed6e5cebea15222197f4116e; 7a1019a49967de973cfc6ceaaf98aed8f642f56b; d7270ea31af21e9493284c643851a3b32ea5e15b; 6969355228e08bc8ea9f28574425be79f353ee3d; 0be62ad837255d146ddc0085a7cc3087911e3c9e; 285483e0b1d694e5f3997ed066b71a412917337e; 16dfbb99a7de6ebe769f3e7b163fd37f2473ee2f; 27d81474885d66a266415be498d7ad519ae61d97; 7fb7e7826a1c6ba35823499c2ac86812bfd8229f; fad718a6e817c398ca987e854247f2c74a85ce05; 681b421783bee8269b6e66dc040fb81d5857a579; 27cfc3b645d8d2ede71c8f7a2f2864d70eb31324; b52b615639ab0b96122fd1faf25443dc8bad25e2; f40f1d4d706f23d1c005cf5bf0bfa51f792694b4,d5f313144ed87bc8be3e8bcce43a5919a47772d7; e4f4cda3cb89ca3089a56e8e1d51eb5cadf66c8b; 6f27937d57b19662d4813fb729aba4ae074b1922; 45b2a1ebae2ebfab8765a4677d2d5a9f1f2bdbff; a2cd0f4c19512a580faef3b2b1dfb2a5d998f2b0; b8ab3bbf27bfc1b4a36aa9c7f06579f9f794d61f; 1e1ede9dfda7549b8769a849bc812a6e1bb51a70; 661e064631857e6e9dc8db20de77ab04efc2a4af; 23b6301c315f549b1f9abf7db4e0adf94b36772f; ebafcfbbb236820bbf110a1f04fe1156d2613b9a; 36584e5585a90dbefd621d76500991fef28a6554; 582a8fc085629efbae206e0ffb1697db856435e7; 22bb3871f69ede06d924dea6ebf6fff1aeaa295e; b0645d940a90ad0053f316e60c7d17f19e3e79a1; dc0b09e4adda6b991be80594ce13b3efc66be3d9; e3383b170c5191dce90184fdc709e3ecdb21ebef; 61245d59da1ceca25b989966fde5064024ca043c; d8a24cf6ad670f43dff5fe4f31a3cbb1e1c80f81; ec7610da694fe30803118ec203444d21a02f85b5; e6fa8fbec02a71271526337de3e04d072d0a75f3; 941d7c1f3041b737e95e27c9f7bc7cd8ece4e5b7; c1706c109d3739a6d5fea67415d6b40f68806d4c; 23c3afc913a86ad65c7911ff74f61064427802fa; d45d61f0ebc660cdebca5a08657a7ac74eb57380; 143e9df0a28f7bb485aed968611269fc587d5d42; e8035e2353c2ece5a4918b864c4882436849be81; f5ff6404a75f98e91a84daa80b27fccbe1477c89; 7464369b9dd37423048d116ce47c0c94ef0a8f57; 84663029e53cf8a42d5dc5d052e1c052eaf20708; 18108b8d91f52121c9a2798741dcdd5097209d4e; ad541fd1081f336679ce4fb167ba06b75d17e775; e4191211368d5a4a637cecba18891014a4338368; d2b76b176c8f0531fcd39ce4cfa69f4b2a8eac5d; cd060544f04097ee5ab4f8bcc5710a432a6ca41d; a968620dcf399d7d7f89f98dc1d3da8c114dac8d; 8a5cb34e17c741f96fe0094352904425de625f51; de40a8097c0abeb300e1053ac1e9b0488dd4d471; 44808357a10b0aed3092270bb983585c0663d03c,Proteomics,12 1,"

275e1b554571b08679cbe13673c88dcdbdc1bffc,Continuous traits and speciation rates: Alternatives to stateâ€dependent diversification models,"Many quantitative traits, for example body size, have been hypothesized to influence the diversification dynamics of lineages over macroevolutionary time-scales. The Quantitative State Speciation-Extinction (QuaSSE) model and related methods provide an elegant framework for jointly modelling the relationship between change in continuous traits and diversification. However, model misspecification and phylogenetic pseudoreplication can result in elevated false discovery rates in this and other state-dependent speciation-extinction models. 
Here, we evaluate alternative trait-dependent diversification methods that do not formally model the relationship between traits and diversification, but instead test for correlations between summary statistics of phylogenetic branching patterns and trait variation at the tips of a phylogenetic tree (hereafter tip-rate correlations or TRCs). We compare alternative branching pattern statistics and significance tests, and we evaluate their performance relative to QuaSSE under a range of evolutionary scenarios. 
We found that a simple statistic derived from branch lengths (inverse equal splits) can detect trait-associated rate variation, and that a simulation-based method performs better than phylogenetic generalized least squares for testing the significance of trait-rate correlations. This test (ES-sim) had better power to detect trait-dependent diversification than other TRCs. By testing the approach across a diverse set of simulation scenarios, we found that ES-sim is similar to QuaSSE in statistical power. However, the approach rarely led to false inferences of trait-dependent diversification, even under conditions that are problematic for formal state-dependent models. We illustrate the application of ES-sim to real data by re-assessing the relationship between dispersal ability and diversification in Furnariid birds.

33bf84c13353f639c1a8cd96d20c4fda4d0db894,An Integrated Statistical Approach to Compare Transcriptomics Data Across Experiments: A Case Study on the Identification of Candidate Target Genes of the Transcription Factor PPARÎ±,"An effective strategy to elucidate the signal transduction cascades activated by a transcription factor is to compare the transcriptional profiles of wild type and transcription factor knockout models. Many statistical tests have been proposed for analyzing gene expression data, but most tests are based on pair-wise comparisons. Since the analysis of microarrays involves the testing of multiple hypotheses within one study, it is generally accepted that one should control for false positives by the false discovery rate (FDR). However, it has been reported that this may be an inappropriate metric for comparing data across different experiments. Here we propose an approach that addresses the above mentioned problem by the simultaneous testing and integration of the three hypotheses (contrasts) using the cell means ANOVA model. These three contrasts test for the effect of a treatment in wild type, gene knockout, and globally over all experimental groups. We illustrate our approach on microarray experiments that focused on the identification of candidate target genes and biological processes governed by the fatty acid sensing transcription factor PPARÎ± in liver. Compared to the often applied FDR based across experiment comparison, our approach identified a conservative but less noisy set of candidate genes with same sensitivity and specificity. However, our method had the advantage of properly adjusting for multiple testing while integrating data from two experiments, and was driven by biological inference. Taken together, in this study we present a simple, yet efficient strategy to compare differential expression of genes across experiments while controlling for multiple hypothesis testing.",2012,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Mohammad Ohid Ullah"", ids = ""7909683""); list(name = ""Michael MÃ¼ller"", ids = ""39953702""); list(name = ""Guido J Hooiveld"", ids = ""143804111"")",,674e116da8d0325cd4a7835b761b8ab5b2f50b3d; 23210528ec5f18f043e7e298688262e4fd28e8ec; 576e20b4180dd997415efe67e73ee2622ad04fed; fe08a552c14d5a05ab6b2645fc4b73fa97103c79; 6d0a9360bbc8484bdc635738a4a2f059ed89745e; dfed7aa4ef1498bf2657452efb5a8decab9bd280; 65c4f601132902530ff0217b21e321e9c7e7812a; 5c929fd0daff7729d6cccea8b73b9dc11f9d8909; 64412e3e602987159c812214d9f55df81a46dbe2; 4a20823dd4ce6003e31f7d4e0649fe8c719926f2; fe667462411d45b3ccac8b18fd2e32f55b3cdadc; c4931e4970e4bb61e3fbbb999521a2447c48812d; 0013d858e41c59e6e9887041451b862f36429627; 72427811bba28d4dbdf6be0e4c51bcc2c2420682; 25fbd10d11fa9ea09ead04ed1e0470f7a3d69df4; d0a47c8c9c4213edd24a120a6912ebc08e348a19; e6bdb698d13c83d504d4ce5b16bd3d0769c0ae0b; 97a431e3d5990a74970417527e0d162527594e84; 5ca1d583e53ca84287a8767b7289dbd6fc4f46ed; 6625ff73b82cf8dc8f533a8b78101341c42de0df; 89a0e8707e15d0861c72be59853a9e61395c696d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f4d3641898c3e1c4f6a9f4c9d58996fd047afe2c; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; f6d018649dae1d7610c9b025f335b7e95c2890a2; 2a2de16f65ab7384ae7567b88b26e20b63fa1d81; af2fd676c46a0e2e576e8292ab3a661384e5c791; 298225258b8e0f50465f6a76cc99d70ee1ae2657; b0dcdc57857e90339539881ada1c434d80aea7dc; b82437dbc9de34953b345a98298b27979749da65; d58ee78578385ccd60e4b02069ab1213dfa0be52; 3cd4a9cdb14b3add799115519e8c617491d675ed; 9571e7ccc1622974a691faa18e6d2272c86c8a8d; 83e6025f99ad97864db7a3b616778dbfef396ce8; 7aeace2306487c5e5f3ff6711e1a5d3fc1e4c899; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; 140e28b488407e4c52bd3b201c44f1f3e693d241,Bioinformatics and Biology Insights,6,145 - 154
458eefed4c9d0c9be6863706747232ce64938ae4,Tear Film Proteomics Reveal Important Differences Between Patients With and Without Ocular GvHD After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.,"Purpose
To date, no biomarkers for ocular graft versus host disease (GvHD), a frequent complication following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), exist. In this prospective study, we evaluated the potential of human tear proteins as biomarkers for ocular GvHD.


Methods
Tears from 10 patients with moderate-to-severe ocular GvHD were compared to 10 patients without ocular GvHD. After a full ocular surface clinical examination, tears were collected onto Schirmer strips and protein composition was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Statistical evaluation was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test to compare means and the false discovery rate method to adjust for multiple comparisons. Functional annotation of differentially expressed proteins was done with the PANTHER classification system.


Results
We identified 282 proteins in tryptic digests of Schirmer strips; 79 proteins were significantly differentially expressed between the two groups, from which 54 were up- and 25 downregulated. The most upregulated proteins were classified as nucleic acid binding and cytoskeletal proteins, while the most extensively downregulated proteins belong to an array of classes including transfer and receptor proteins, enzyme modulators, and hydrolases. In addition to proteins already confirmed as differentially expressed in dry eye disease, we report changes in 36 novel proteins.


Conclusions
This study reports the proteomic profile of tears in ocular GvHD for the first time and identifies a number of unique differentially expressed proteins. Further studies with a higher number of participants are necessary to confirm these results and to evaluate the reliability of these expression patterns in longitudinal studies.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nadine Gerber-Hollbach"", ids = ""1398578659""); list(name = ""Kim David Plattner"", ids = ""31938808""); list(name = ""Olivia E.

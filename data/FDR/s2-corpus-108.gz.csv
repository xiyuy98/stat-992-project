da42fd206d1e5bad2e26e631d7bd7e6e08e84ce9,Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Using Non-parametric Scores,"Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a well-known technique used for studying groups of functionally related genes and their correlation with phenotype. This method creates a ranked list of genes, which is used to calculate an enrichment score. In this work, we introduce two different metrics for gene ranking in GSEA, namely the Wilcoxon and the Baumgartner-Weis-Schindler tests. The advantage of these metrics is that they do not assume any particular distribution on the data. We compared them with the signal-to-noise ratio metric originally proposed by the developers of GSEA on a type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) database. Statistical significance is evaluated by means of false discovery rate and p-value calculations. Results show that the Baumgartner-WeisSchindler test detects more pathways with statistical significance. One of them could be related to DM2, according to the literature, but further research is needed.",2007,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Ariel E.

7e0e77eaaf85d1d36a8a0eb1053251bd0d9a159f,Voxelwise statistical methods to localize practice variation in brain tumor surgery,"PURPOSE
During resections of brain tumors, neurosurgeons have to weigh the risk between residual tumor and damage to brain functions. Different perspectives on these risks result in practice variation. We present statistical methods to localize differences in extent of resection between institutions which should enable to reveal brain regions affected by such practice variation.


METHODS
Synthetic data were generated by simulating spheres for brain, tumors, resection cavities, and an effect region in which a likelihood of surgical avoidance could be varied between institutions. Three statistical methods were investigated: a non-parametric permutation based approach, Fisher's exact test, and a full Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model. For all three methods the false discovery rate (FDR) was determined as a function of the cut-off value for the q-value or the highest density interval, and receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves were created. Sensitivity to variations in the parameters of the synthetic model were investigated. Finally, all these methods were applied to retrospectively collected data of 77 brain tumor resections in two academic hospitals.


RESULTS
Fisher's method provided an accurate estimation of observed FDR in the synthetic data, whereas the permutation approach was too liberal and underestimated FDR. AUC values were similar for Fisher and Bayes methods, and superior to the permutation approach. Fisher's method deteriorated and became too liberal for reduced tumor size, a smaller size of the effect region, a lower overall extent of resection, fewer patients per cohort, and a smaller discrepancy in surgical avoidance probabilities between the different surgical practices. In the retrospective patient data, all three methods identified a similar effect region, with lower estimated FDR in Fisher's method than using the permutation method.


CONCLUSIONS
Differences in surgical practice may be detected using voxel statistics. Fisher's test provides a fast method to localize differences but could underestimate true FDR. Bayesian MCMC is more flexible and easily extendable, and leads to similar results, but at increased computational cost.",2019,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Roelant Eijgelaar"", ids = ""13807284""); list(name = ""Philip C. de Witt Hamer"", ids = ""1865883""); list(name = ""Carel F.

03dff3aea029b3c8613179b9be50438fe60a1407,A replication study of 49 Type 2 diabetes risk variants in a Punjabi Pakistani population.,"AIM
The burden of Type 2 diabetes is alarmingly high in South Asia, a region that has many genetically diverse ethnic populations. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted largely in European populations have identified a number of loci predisposing to Type 2 diabetes risk, however, the relevance of such genetic loci in many South Asian sub-ethnicities remains elusive. The aim of this study was to replicate 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously identified through GWAS in Punjabis living in Pakistan.


METHODS
We examined the association of 49 SNPs in 853 Type 2 diabetes cases and 1945 controls using additive logistic regression models after adjusting for age and gender.


RESULTS
Of the 49 SNPs investigated, eight showed a nominal association (P < 0.05) that also remained significant after controlling for the false discovery rate. The most significant association was found for rs7903146 at the TCF7L2 locus. For a per unit increase in the risk score comprising of all the 49 SNPs, the odds ratio in association with Type 2 diabetes risk was 1.16 (95% CI 1.13-1.19, P < 2.0E-16).


CONCLUSION
These results suggest that some Type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci are shared between Europeans and Punjabis living in Pakistan.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Asima Zia"", ids = ""5777851""); list(name = ""Xinjia Wang"", ids = ""50141631""); list(name = ""Attya Bhatti"", ids = ""32400814""); list(name = ""Fatma Yesim Demirci"", ids = ""47794233""); list(name = ""Wei Zhao"", ids = ""144876300""); list(name = ""Asif Rasheed"", ids = ""49219372""); list(name = ""Maria Werner Samuel"", ids = ""40406923""); list(name = ""Aysha Karim Kiani"", ids = ""31932361""); list(name = ""Muhammad Fadhil Syukri Ismail"", ids = ""145246893""); list(name = ""Jamal Zafar"", ids = ""4642998""); list(name = ""Peter John"", ids = ""29691541""); list(name = ""Danish Saleheen"", ids = ""6914246""); list(name = ""M.

ea2f0698c44bc58b19e21ba10bd41a9b6bc599d0,Effects of estrogen on bone mRNA levels of sclerostin and other genes relevant to bone metabolism in postmenopausal women.,"CONTEXT
Studies in postmenopausal women have shown that estrogen reduces circulating sclerostin levels, but effects of estrogen on skeletal sclerostin mRNA levels are unknown.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of short-term estrogen treatment on bone mRNA levels of sclerostin and other genes relevant to bone metabolism.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS
Needle bone biopsies were obtained from 20 postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estrogen for 3 weeks and 20 untreated controls. Quantitative PCR analyses were used to examine the expression of sclerostin and other genes related to bone metabolism, including 71 additional genes linked to bone density/fracture from genome-wide association studies.


RESULTS
Estrogen treatment was associated with lower bone sclerostin mRNA levels (by 48%, P<.05) and with lower (by 54%, P<.01) mRNA levels of the sclerostin-related protein, sclerostin domain-containing protein 1 (SOSTDC1), which is also a Wnt/bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor. Consistent with studies in mice showing that ovariectomy increased nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) activation, we found that estrogen treatment was associated with a significant reduction in inflammatory genes as a group (P=.028), with bone mRNA levels of NFKB2 and RELB (both encoding proteins in the NF-ÎºB transcription factor complex) being significantly reduced individual genes. Eight of the 71 genome-wide association study-related genes examined were modulated by estrogen (P<.05, false discovery rate<0.10).


CONCLUSION
In humans, estrogen-induced decreases in two key inhibitors of Wnt/bone morphogenetic protein signaling, sclerostin and SOSTDC1, along with reductions in NF-ÎºB signaling, may be responsible for at least part of the protective effects of estrogen on bone.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Koji Fujita"", ids = ""145314692""); list(name = ""Matthew M.

cf24c819d5bb518bdce05aca32a2d42aa2cc99b7,Revisiting peptide identification by high-accuracy mass spectrometry: problems associated with the use of narrow mass precursor windows.,"Peptide identification is increasingly achieved through database searches in which mass precursor tolerance is set in the ppm range. This trend is driven by the high resolution and accuracy of modern mass spectrometers and the belief that the quality of peptide identification is fully controlled by estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) using the decoy-target approach. However, narrowing mass tolerance decreases the number of sequence candidates, and several authors have raised concerns that these search conditions can introduce inaccuracies. Here, we demonstrate that when scores that only depend on one sequence candidate are used, decoy-based estimates of the number of false positive identifications are accurate even with an average number of candidates of just 200, to the point that remarkably accurate FDR predictions can be made in completely different search conditions. However, when scores that are constructed taking information from additional sequence candidates are used together with low precursor mass tolerances, the proportion of peptides incorrectly identified may become significantly higher than the FDR estimated by the target-decoy approach. Our results suggest that with this kind of score the high mass accuracy of modern mass spectrometers should be exploited by using wide mass windows followed by postscoring mass filtering algorithms.",2015,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Elena Bonzon-Kulichenko"", ids = ""1398336169""); list(name = ""Fernando GarcÃ­a-MarquÃ©s"", ids = ""1399220089""); list(name = ""Marco Trevisan-Herraz"", ids = ""1399220087""); list(name = ""JesÃºs VÃ¡zquez"", ids = ""152495293"")",c773a0114e20c1cb8a94186c9a285d0d307af837; 6be22dab1cedf4e9d421ce6371ede3af69e0d87b; bdbd477c1c19dac6f710e41a9749f8bb20995201; 6492918286fa1858d7088535a4789423a7e34f38; eea8ffcbd7d006da3664dd30fb662d18b7d2bc8f; 8ae7c85bc97cee87f4599f47efc75d4a4d1cb0dc; bdf941b1af86214a11872936138db1a4a9b65893; 362049557df1985f132e2a078df97e7477fdec1d; af7bf9b1a6ec1335cbf64ab1815bdad5d33a9b29; a87d43b5d4902ec4831556497ccd1587ec3dae30; 0596f8c0e8d83f3942232b4cf1afcb0bb33ee2c7; fbc6427f95e4779b926e7e50d921cc0f5d79729c; 7001a4515f9547470848b13c9f3e141489c81c68; f393df4bbba1ce50912d84a73255906b168f52df; 650813556735103144aba234723fb093278106ad; 432e56f238f0b781fb9a2d10063a9d5a98930d18; e6dcc4702504d4588cc13ea734d3524aa3d58475; e2ac09a0dab0b4767a4e98cadb7370c3b3df165e; f7c4c5c13f1f5f5de9d80c4b5b2f2bd733929438; 44f0b71853658a34bb038be11da352a54ed96c28; 441129629cb3c3ee104bbff6109add279293efed; 62df65a688cc355328443590d78cd765851e1e4e; e31e91b759ef4dc838143de53219a9074707cdbd; d05eff09e4402667a696074a231c87b62750c9d4; bf707b6b130d5b5a1fbb180925cef1811d7ad7ab; 3d52e942bb724798ec00919e9f834a4d4850319b; a83cdf7126efa61bac2dde04bae884f005d8f903,1ef83b2b980b406db708adb6104533be05af9854; afcf883c8e4d1f97a6325b15cc6401d0b8c44656; 5d32703bf686df7889386248e6f46a0c4a0b6c8e; ca1ed8fd9ba9683108d7cf61ef31aff50b2eb293; 2bdbd53ae48d92be98ea00fd7550189d3ca53ce6; 681caffb68803996c44399bdcc4324cdff80b7d0; d038d7acea15ed1a4454ed47f53da7135415b8a4; 0f5751f76cef4a502b22ad088c381a4d0bb10121; ce0051f3293d7668c6199fa34118ee1301c638d8; f09d4a533a221b9b85c591ba1dc862dd2fe808a1; e6ff5a0111a42c5ea20f7ce9716024047cc694c4; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 96f9f7ddce258fc85e3b1532b7471e2c4c640fd7; bfaf760ed0ac82fd9b8150aaf30841ece4698e77; 8fde4e634e968019018732c3857699a22feb021d; 582a8fc085629efbae206e0ffb1697db856435e7; 1d0b40e380641cb3825760a4a4a2c60df4ad9900; c733796b3c3244eb43927031997e88fefdec3522; f90e8e0de9083fa6e664f29cc69c3b2ded9db616; d42b45b1a05fc24546d7cbc59cf9ed45a765b849; 6515e1c42fd9cdbf83ad7d91bf1ee7c8e98e551b; 1f50f651b32791d4d9e44d99dda8fa8c92bd35e7; 631fe3da480f8d903f574cfb89f6d06c1cef6947,Journal of proteome research,14 2,"

7a32e0e57544ea1537f9545e0459fd0c6c3d1332,Generation of a Predictive Score for Ixazomib Response in Multiple Myeloma,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second-most common hematopoietic malignancy in the United States accounting for 1% of all cancers and 10% of all hematologic malignancies. Despite recent improvements in treatment strategies including the emergence of proteasome inhibitors (PIs) as effective chemotherapeutic agents, MM still remains difficult to cure with median survival rate of around 7 years, primarily due to wide inter-individual variation in response to treatment. We believe such heterogeneity in response to PIs is governed by the underlying molecular characteristics of the tumor including alterations in gene expression profile (GEP). In the current study, we used a panel of Human Myeloma Cell Lines (HMCLs) representing the gamut of biological and genetic heterogeneity in MM to evaluate the gene expression signatures associated with response to the second-generation PI Ixazomib and produced a predictive score (PI score) for Ix response. HMCLs (n=45) were treated with increasing concentrations of Ixazomib used as single agent and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values were determined using cell viability equation. Gene expression profiling data was obtained as publicly available data from the Keats lab website at TGen (http://www.keatslab.org/myeloma-cell-lines). Genes with high expression value and high standard deviation beyond the median values were pre-filtered and log expression values were normalized by subtracting mean expression of individual genes across all the samples and the housekeeping genes (GAPDH). Subsequently, analysis of correlation between Ix IC 50 data and GEP data and the False Discovery Rate (FDR) based on 1000 random permutations were performed to identify true patterns of genes that are highly predictive of Ix response and to look for the top genes that could discriminate between the top sensitive and top resistant cell lines. Gene clusters were identified that correlated with response and will be presented. Our results will demonstrate in vitro modeling of response using GEP approaches that may provide predictive scoring algorithms of a defined set of genes that will be useful in clinical evaluation of drug choice in treating individual patients.

e712b0f707fc28499fbbbc3d1a54411e56f52723,PepDistiller: A quality control tool to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of peptide identifications in shotgun proteomics.,"In this study, we presented a quality control tool named PepDistiller to facilitate the validation of MASCOT search results. By including the number of tryptic termini, and integrating a refined false discovery rate (FDR) calculation method, we demonstrated the improved sensitivity of peptide identifications obtained from semitryptic search results. Based on the analysis of a complex data set, approximately 7% more peptide identifications were obtained using PepDistiller than using MASCOT Percolator. Moreover, the refined method generated lower FDR estimations than the percentage of incorrect target (PIT) fixed method applied in Percolator.

7e1504bbd2af7ff9b7f4568f3d3ff5507112c2df,A New Adaptive Method to Control the False Discovery Rate,"Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli (BKY, 2006) have given an adaptive method of controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) by incorporating an estimate of n0, the number of true null hypotheses, into the FDR controlling method of Benjamini and Hochberg (BH, 1995). The BKY method improves the BH method in terms of the FDR control and power. Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli have proved that their method controls the FDR when the p-values are independent and provided numerical evidence showing that the control over the FDR continues to hold when the p-values have some type of positive dependence. In this paper, we propose an alternative adaptive method via a different estimate of n0. Like the BKY method, this new method controls the FDR under the independence, and can maintain a control over the FDR, as shown numerically, under the same type of positive dependence of the p-values. More importantly, as our simulations indicate, the proposed method can often outperform the BKY method in terms of the FDR control and power, particularly when the correlation between the test statistics is moderately low or the proportion of true null hypotheses is very high. When applied to a real microarray data, the new method is seen to pick up a few more significant genes than the BKY method.",2011,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Fang Liu"", ids = ""47185625""); list(name = ""Sanat K.

bf872c24860cb9b8ab6555c928ce1dd9f7102547,MicroRNA expression profiles and networks in mouse lung infected with H1N1 influenza virus,"Influenza A viruses can cause localized outbreaks and worldwide pandemics, owing to their high transmissibility and wide host range. As such, they are among the major diseases that cause human death. However, the molecular changes induced by influenza A virus infection in lung tissue are not entirely clear. Changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression occur in many pathological and physiological processes, and influenza A virus infection has been shown to alter miRNA expression in cultured cells and animal models. In this study, we mined key miRNAs closely related to influenza A virus infection and explored cellular regulatory mechanisms against influenza A virus infection, by building networks among miRNAs and genes, gene ontologies (GOs), and pathways. In this study, miRNAs and mRNAs induced by H1N1 influenza virus infection were measured by gene chips, and we found that 82 miRNAs and 3371 mRNAs were differentially expressed. The 82 miRNAs were further analyzed with the series test of cluster (STC) analysis. Three of the 16 cluster profiles identified by STC, which include 46 miRNAs in the three profiles, changed significantly. Using potential target genes of the 46 miRNAs, we looked for intersections of these genes with 3371 differentially expressed mRNAs; 719 intersection genes were identified. Based on the GO or KEGG databases, we attained GOs or pathways for all of the above intersection genes. Fisherâ€™s and Ï‡2 test were used to calculate p value and false discovery rate (FDR), and according to the standard of pÂ <Â 0.001, 241 GOs and 76 pathways were filtered. Based on these data, miRNAâ€“gene, miRNAâ€“GO, and miRNAâ€“pathway networks were built. We then extracted three classes of GOs (related to inflammatory and immune response, cell cycle, proliferation and apoptosis, and signal transduction) to build three subgraphs, and pathways strictly related with H1N1 influenza virus infection were filtered to extract a subgraph of the miRNA-pathway network. Last, according to the pathway analysis and miRNA-pathway network analysis, 17 miRNAs were found to be associated with the â€œinfluenza Aâ€ pathway. This study provides the most complete miRNAome profiles, and the most detailed miRNA regulatory networks to date, and is the first to report the most important 17 miRNAs closely related with the pathway of influenza A. These results are a prelude to advancements in mouse H1N1 influenza virus infection biology and the use of mice as a model for human H1N1 influenza virus infection studies.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yanyan Bao"", ids = ""37225379""); list(name = ""Yingjie Gao"", ids = ""3023124""); list(name = ""Yahong Jin"", ids = ""7419561""); list(name = ""Weihong Cong"", ids = ""145870547""); list(name = ""Xin Pan"", ids = ""144680011""); list(name = ""Xiaolan Cui"", ids = ""48960627"")",5535e5af78862ba55edc0ded64e4f0bc5f925a2e; 6dda2dfcf7f117d273bee5cf5f9e73489213bbd3; 5c5b19d086023e28a165c44069c98e316c22458c; 8053036e4032c1cc672b26c7d667c2f43256db8b; 3995d67a5f5b118d8c96675151e8efa15198c641; 68a63e06f55228b35dc32046199105aa4bb8d725; c4bb0c1153e4d059407ef389e7e4bf16c0ca95c9,c38ce1f85351288607a21bb46ff5b17fbfd99de8; 9ae988b355d1daccd5983cd2681361edc0698a9f; 7c98d4cb54221f0c52e9f836e57c53a2b3b604c8; afee872d676d90141c6be9e102eaba266994bd05; 60fdbc05dfd6a7cdd0edfbb273767b26da8f1641; 40596c15c92237c90c5062eeee79843d32c6a72a; 7cad8811b26d3a47012b7aaf41e3a84645c0d908; 51026faff66d0e93474e9214afc461436b8c4bc0; bd13ddb20f71465cd5abefb279ea6b6581292ee7; 01a6af9cec52dd72730c74bd1bc63a3e47eaf664; b9aff0acab5bc656c9cfd83555ecf81d3a40c90f; 85a350908396f4b9ac9cdedf22e37aba9fc4223c; 0720abebaf68a21e1e91663e768c55873b22c347; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 3bb275c6b7ba8dea44ca78108bf654089e08cc8e; bd864a27e6984e0ff4673b08f4b286777b59689c; 63ed296e9c3c42a4035a0c4162e321e03921fa03; 374c8ef7124c6d60b313574ceb5562c65e0b79be; 70db68bb0be417eaa382398278fbd1347256942a; 9935fe33fd8c2e6f5a5c4826218bf8038a39703d; 6e60d4876a1aee3e06841061a42797ff43a4a827; f8f9b12c954f55fb14fc701679b3776c5e95f79d; b0a778df814caab5cf6dec3a6ee0a984122886a5; eb4c111df6950d52345d9fe94c5a701b70cba7bc; df8ecef4c1ad06f672b45022241fae499e832d44; aac61dbdad235c440e11cf6944e91f1fbdb653a7; f82b48dedf81d609c592024f4aa7ee750b3b3e5c; a0213f9bc2e0507d5f25637bb5ddd0321d92d8ef; 97cc7ab1b0d200d38f802bfc26c7315fb4a07ce3; 2ee4cb0527b4d44f3a2be8bec83bb4b6ae72c494; 4667ad4302254f67ef8c831ede8e4cd8d0709715; bad74826bd1fae61529d218e482f8fc825be25c8; 88c91d0e599352720facee78408de34e00fefa69,Molecular Genetics and Genomics,290,1885-1897
a928e3414ac6d04da43b3dd7a5a699f764ed14f4,Plasma microRNA profiles for bladder cancer detection.,"BACKGROUND
Bladder cancer (BC) is a burdensome disease with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. The development of novel plasma-based biomarkers for BC diagnosis and surveillance could significantly improve clinical outcomes and decrease health expenditures. Plasma miRNAs are promising biomarkers that have yet to be rigorously investigated in BC.


OBJECTIVE
To determine the feasibility and efficacy of detecting BC with plasma miRNA signatures.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasma miRNA was isolated from 20 patients with bladder cancer and 18 noncancerous controls. Samples were analyzed with a miRNA array containing duplicate probes for each miRNA in the Sanger database. Logistic regression modeling was used to optimize diagnostic miRNA signatures to distinguish between muscle invasive BC (MIBC), non-muscle-invasive BC (NMIBC) and noncancerous controls.


RESULTS
Seventy-nine differentially expressed plasma miRNAs (local false discovery rate [FDR] <0.5) in patients with or without BC were identified. Some diagnostically relevant miRNAs, such as miR-200b, were up-regulated in MIBC patients, whereas others, such as miR-92 and miR-33, were inversely correlated with advanced clinical stage, supporting the notion that miRNAs released in the circulation have a variety of cellular origins. Logistic regression modeling was able to predict diagnosis with 89% accuracy for detecting the presence or absence of BC, 92% accuracy for distinguishing invasive BC from other cases, 100% accuracy for distinguishing MIBC from controls, and 79% accuracy for three-way classification between MIBC, NIMBC, and controls.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides preliminary data supporting the use of plasma miRNAs as a noninvasive means of BC detection. Future studies will be required to further specify the optimal plasma miRNA signature, and to apply these signatures to clinical scenarios, such as initial BC detection and BC surveillance.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Liana Adam"", ids = ""145609718""); list(name = ""Matthew F.

34b1a0fe93a87b1420513c6b88f0360a757adaf6,A gene selection method for GeneChip array data with small sample sizes,"BackgroundIn microarray experiments with small sample sizes, it is a challenge to estimate p-values accurately and decide cutoff p-values for gene selection appropriately. Although permutation-based methods have proved to have greater sensitivity and specificity than the regular t-test, their p-values are highly discrete due to the limited number of permutations available in very small sample sizes. Furthermore, estimated permutation-based p-values for true nulls are highly correlated and not uniformly distributed between zero and one, making it difficult to use current false discovery rate (FDR)-controlling methods.ResultsWe propose a model-based information sharing method (MBIS) that, after an appropriate data transformation, utilizes information shared among genes. We use a normal distribution to model the mean differences of true nulls across two experimental conditions. The parameters of the model are then estimated using all data in hand. Based on this model, p-values, which are uniformly distributed from true nulls, are calculated. Then, since FDR-controlling methods are generally not well suited to microarray data with very small sample sizes, we select genes for a given cutoff p-value and then estimate the false discovery rate.ConclusionSimulation studies and analysis using real microarray data show that the proposed method, MBIS, is more powerful and reliable than current methods.

314eca5521a154fe18924362502f0f1e1090bdd1,High-Dimensional Bayesian Network Inference From Systems Genetics Data Using Genetic Node Ordering,"Studying the impact of genetic variation on gene regulatory networks is essential to understand the biological mechanisms by which genetic variation causes variation in phenotypes. Bayesian networks provide an elegant statistical approach for multi-trait genetic mapping and modelling causal trait relationships. However, inferring Bayesian gene networks from high-dimensional genetics and genomics data is challenging, because the number of possible networks scales super-exponentially with the number of nodes, and the computational cost of conventional Bayesian network inference methods quickly becomes prohibitive. We propose an alternative method to infer high-quality Bayesian gene networks that easily scales to thousands of genes. Our method first reconstructs a node ordering by conducting pairwise causal inference tests between genes, which then allows to infer a Bayesian network via a series of independent variable selection problems, one for each gene. We demonstrate using simulated and real systems genetics data that this results in a Bayesian network with equal, and sometimes better, likelihood than the conventional methods, while having a significantly higher over-lap with groundtruth networks and being orders of magnitude faster. Moreover our method allows for a unified false discovery rate control across genes and individual edges, and thus a rigorous and easily interpretable way for tuning the sparsity level of the inferred network. Bayesian network inference using pairwise node ordering is a highly efficient approach for reconstructing gene regulatory networks when prior information for the inclusion of edges exists or can be inferred from the available data.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Lingfei Wang"", ids = ""48169855""); list(name = ""Pieter Audenaert"", ids = ""3150910""); list(name = ""Tom Michoel"", ids = ""1700559"")",314eca5521a154fe18924362502f0f1e1090bdd1,f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; b0b92b393fa58f005fc78264ff0988b925a28b3e; ff02f3e04f710bb85d3d949880ce31428ab517eb; 791ee0c644dae1efe99fb56764ceb71998e3828e; d9b57a10aaab6403746aad217ac5a7da728172eb; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 328ffc2e64c790a9467503c3ba37cca3f9ab66a7; 09e37c45e9a6785280f1abfd66bd59367c6ef53c; b447ccce330d2f7865d3b2e6f69e026cf24b9df3; f339c868235f0ea6c29149b90d6f2bfe8c32823a; 5cc657d5295f6091a3ef4ac898bf15342f5ed26e; 82e08f67e0c8659dd935f89309e2f981cbf9f4af; 8975eddaabc92d61f9d1e205b80b8cfffa5de31c; fd794c44cf99ae3fe18149dd87d112cb33a98bf5; 9f6d586c3153963149aa61834c43726845b35cde; f6d5bdaa9ea5d90bf94608f68b1c8dd36d1ac843; befd9a39a29c29e2708da2d077821e2d3ae73420; e1f6890da6fb8992328c14d3f0e8eddea2636f78; 2916c78876cebccab42d8e29ab7d73b2d7517276; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; f5f4036e062793e5da8863f1a55c46fc59263b87; 789a9d8615a70cd5ca8760beedcca0c29c438e27; a03106ea6708bfb9d4159565ab88837b42cebc5d; 41c64e57c8a400f6f884fd44d1d7b96b52a61707; 1c32b899176b52d997fa9c58df11e7159cfd4c84; fbe8f6337ea5efa546265757c0dcf86e44314f09; e3bd9ae3e3418c1ee91332f913826544422f6fc4; 64cefd9cd4d14d90d765d5455d59a97dd99c6269; 36da5dad0cc4a2cec249a7753aac86692d073fc2; 76638b1bb15097926b6ecb57a7f25e44bd179a3d; 288f495b91279d1096beeb6d72930572d5afff7c; 1f80564d9a33720e0bb525bc2fdd50c30fcc449e; 7fd4f8e9167677ce2e062d36dd912df345427bd5; ef4d82e56b38834331617e60ab64ec56f21d4334; 9b94b15485a6f09d79d03155990342035a28d520; 440e593ab4d2cb0fd0058365ff7e71ae99d50f37; 5a732cbea5024f1f3b1312293c49c1db65d96ea0; d0993707d34504c95448673f4591e94bef17fa55; ba455643072b6e11b4591b43f29fd3558590947f; 749df704a21c425e70f214f6732755ff7102470e; fde4695ebf04f6e0ac5f861548e09af7931078fa; f3de817b2cd56609ff9f15369f1d38bcdd8c74bc; da00458ce63b9a87326bddde9a692ae743d7dde7; b088e0beee73075d4ebcc35469df4b67b70e51f5; 1239b88111a5f1c20622d58406fb15bf02c31947; 414aea5ee7be76e6fb69b50a47e5cff1bb5bbb27; f0f9da69867fbe4545464cf98f015df8d3987754; b8fe1ad88938f76cbd72d4c4751927a21a542f0a; 34a2992ed28e5af6225a08457376c96d35b2acdb; 8d1c7cbc051dc5d27fdddccabfc702ddb8fe4847; 314eca5521a154fe18924362502f0f1e1090bdd1; 142512f37445170328958f2de7e0d9ebf70cb738; c0ca80da0a512b35f0b66106d016c9b5080cb95f; ba0301afcbcd2a4e3ad110fc719e79e8fddb6525; 6a324ff29bca5cb4584ca869a9bab987fc8bed3f; 94ba1940260ba445df9e7ff5b995dd8f9db4dfb0; 79c7d6903e12e1b45bb3f8bc6ca862fed92b06ea; c27e16cf9b626e983ad6372a25e98e060053afcb; 5b3841e147e3196f14e2f6212bd95398d6190224; d677df8789f6f47fbc2ee48a6ab4016c59127a4f,Frontiers in Genetics,10,
a5fc2f49d9d32e647c43c84e31af6453269ead53,Harvest: an open-source tool for the validation and improvement of peptide identification metrics and fragmentation exploration,"BackgroundProtein identification using mass spectrometry is an important tool in many areas of the life sciences, and in proteomics research in particular. Increasing the number of proteins correctly identified is dependent on the ability to include new knowledge about the mass spectrometry fragmentation process, into computational algorithms designed to separate true matches of peptides to unidentified mass spectra from spurious matches. This discrimination is achieved by computing a function of the various features of the potential match between the observed and theoretical spectra to give a numerical approximation of their similarity. It is these underlying ""metrics"" that determine the ability of a protein identification package to maximise correct identifications while limiting false discovery rates. There is currently no software available specifically for the simple implementation and analysis of arbitrary novel metrics for peptide matching and for the exploration of fragmentation patterns for a given dataset.ResultsWe present Harvest: an open source software tool for analysing fragmentation patterns and assessing the power of a new piece of information about the MS/MS fragmentation process to more clearly differentiate between correct and random peptide assignments. We demonstrate this functionality using data metrics derived from the properties of individual datasets in a peptide identification context. Using Harvest, we demonstrate how the development of such metrics may improve correct peptide assignment confidence in the context of a high-throughput proteomics experiment and characterise properties of peptide fragmentation.ConclusionsHarvest provides a simple framework in C++ for analysing and prototyping metrics for peptide matching, the core of the protein identification problem. It is not a protein identification package and answers a different research question to packages such as Sequest, Mascot, X!Tandem, and other protein identification packages. It does not aim to maximise the number of assigned peptides from a set of unknown spectra, but instead provides a method by which researchers can explore fragmentation properties and assess the power of novel metrics for peptide matching in the context of a given experiment.

Accumulated evidence implicates the involvement of glutamatergic receptors in the pathophysiology of MDD and antidepressant treatment. By using 193 MDD patients who have been taking venlafaxine for 6 weeks, we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 4 (GRIK4), glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunit 1 (GRIA1) and glutamate metabotropic receptor 7 (GRM7) were associated with treatment response. 14 SNPs were selected randomly depended on association studies. Efficacy of treatment was determined by 17-item of Hamilton Rating Scale. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between responders and non-responders. After adjusting by the false discovery rate (FDR), rs6589847 and rs56275759 in GRIK4 and rs9870680 in GRM7 showed associating with venlafaxine treatment response at week 6. (FDR: Pâ€Š=â€Š.018, Pâ€Š=â€Š.042, and Pâ€Š=â€Š.040, respectively).

b557948bad2d678eaded83058e6e014c76846ed6,A Statistical Framework for Modeling HLA-Dependent T Cell Response Data,"The identification of T cell epitopes and their HLA (human leukocyte antigen) restrictions is important for applications such as the design of cellular vaccines for HIV. Traditional methods for such identification are costly and time-consuming. Recently, a more expeditious laboratory technique using ELISpot assays has been developed that allows for rapid screening of specific responses. However, this assay does not directly provide information concerning the HLA restriction of a response, a critical piece of information for vaccine design. Thus, we introduce, apply, and validate a statistical model for identifying HLA-restricted epitopes from ELISpot data. By looking at patterns across a broad range of donors, in conjunction with our statistical model, we can determine (probabilistically) which of the HLA alleles are likely to be responsible for the observed reactivities. Additionally, we can provide a good estimate of the number of false positives generated by our analysis (i.e., the false discovery rate). This model allows us to learn about new HLA-restricted epitopes from ELISpot data in an efficient, cost-effective, and high-throughput manner. We applied our approach to data from donors infected with HIV and identified many potential new HLA restrictions. Among 134 such predictions, six were confirmed in the lab and the remainder could not be ruled as invalid. These results shed light on the extent of HLA class I promiscuity, which has significant implications for the understanding of HLA class I antigen presentation and vaccine development.",2007,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jennifer Listgarten"", ids = ""1760519""); list(name = ""Nicole Frahm"", ids = ""2729224""); list(name = ""Carl Myers Kadie"", ids = ""1772349""); list(name = ""Christian Brander"", ids = ""1788095""); list(name = ""David Heckerman"", ids = ""48099028"")",f9f6ebc6afe2a4c095c912c997143125b561ba11; abc771cb7cd8e431a749f28470755a3536090455; 9a8c236f4e0f69306311a672ae6ac7b5a0cc6aaf; 3452cfb8b817ab5369e4155a27b5f8786029b62d,eae553ae278b84801d65209cfdb7be07aaf25a09; 399444b07ce18cdd9975b8c524e0deedcea28578; a712482db197b24e8c96950824b2c5f084c80632; 74bc091da1be3fade9e943603bab2e1722fc7e04; 6c358b328818143c188ffa71d596c285c5c9dc40; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; c801a87e4f48dbe8d988cad384ebeaf24710b3a3; 477847be67109ae0e7da277c188274c09f64d241; dd5610e04192db4e4543e4a69f0fc7e2b50d3c5b; ba6363b984c2d89adcfe97b785745a32c9cf7b33; a06b0667e6b5fb30da8d3fb57f1c3d925023bfaf; 9d20d779dafc6193a6ec9a964a540bbcf893d190; e4f971de384642dea88cbe1cd6b523cbfc33ded1; 277b6accc82872010ebebfc79214ca2913c483b7; 167b76319cc7546790bd50ab75ad88b318025126; 162733f1f7f2af787c87e635144dcae3f38e2c14; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f7f15848cd0fbb3d08f351595da833b1627de9c3; ddd12789e26025181fc8e63d7ac36486186fb457; 34c33bee67a03dcde4be72667c90b97580364d38; c549bf3bb644705fe9a3ffed9dac83a2401f4fa6; 50b21837c6cf8f5f7a2667d71a847fff7c0fc9e8; d28785a144ef015ad538f126bdd3ce530ca30157; 281da105b1d233d3a99663a3adca415c15baa22e; 50a42ed2f81b9fe150883a6c89194c88a9647106,PLoS Computational Biology,3,
2b0fde414b0faa0b3e1ed67af2ad29db2d9b17f9,Fecal metabolomics: assay performance and association with colorectal cancer.,"Metabolomic analysis of feces may provide insights on colorectal cancer (CRC) if assay performance is satisfactory. In lyophilized feces from 48 CRC cases, 102 matched controls, and 48 masked quality control specimens, 1043 small molecules were detected with a commercial platform. Assay reproducibility was good for 527 metabolites [technical intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) >0.7 in quality control specimens], but reproducibility in 6-month paired specimens was lower for the majority of metabolites (within-subject ICC â‰¤0.5). In the CRC cases and controls, significant differences (false discovery rate â‰¤0.10) were found for 41 of 1043 fecal metabolites. Direct cancer association was found with three fecal heme-related molecules [covariate-adjusted 90th versus 10th percentile odds ratio (OR) = 17-345], 18 peptides/amino acids (OR = 3-14), palmitoyl-sphingomyelin (OR = 14), mandelate (OR = 3) and p-hydroxy-benzaldehyde (OR = 4). Conversely, cancer association was inverse with acetaminophen metabolites (OR <0.1), tocopherols (OR = 0.3), sitostanol (OR = 0.2), 3-dehydrocarnitine (OR = 0.4), pterin (OR = 0.3), conjugated-linoleate-18-2N7 (OR = 0.2), N-2-furoyl-glycine (OR = 0.3) and p-aminobenzoate (PABA, OR = 0.2). Correlations suggested an independent role for palmitoyl-sphingomyelin and a central role for PABA (which was stable over 6 months, within-subject ICC 0.67) modulated by p-hydroxy-benzaldehyde. Power calculations based on ICCs indicate that only 45% of metabolites with a true relative risk 5.0 would be found in prospectively collected, prediagnostic specimens from 500 cases and 500 controls.

ab185d92cff28e59ab51bcdd9c466322e2a060ab,Cerebrospinal fluid markers including trefoil factor 3 are associated with neurodegeneration in amyloid-positive individuals,"We aimed to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers associated with neurodegeneration in individuals with and without CSF evidence of Alzheimer pathology. We investigated 287 Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects (age=74.9Â±6.9; 22/48/30% with Alzheimerâ€™s disease/mild cognitive impairment/controls) with CSF multiplex analyte data and serial volumetric MRI. We calculated brain and hippocampal atrophy rates, ventricular expansion and Mini Mental State Examination decline. We used false discovery rate corrected regression analyses to assess associations between CSF variables and atrophy rates in individuals with and without amyloid pathology, adjusting in stages for tau, baseline volume, p-tau, age, sex, ApoE4 status and diagnosis. Analytes showing statistically significant independent relationships were entered into reverse stepwise analyses. Adjusting for tau, baseline volume, p-tau, age, sex and ApoE4, 4/83 analytes were significantly independently associated with brain atrophy rate, 1/83 with ventricular expansion and 2/83 with hippocampal atrophy. The strongest CSF predictor for the three atrophy measures was low trefoil factor 3 (TFF3). High cystatin C (CysC) was associated with higher whole brain atrophy and hippocampal atrophy rates. Lower levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and chromogranin A (CrA) were associated with higher whole brain atrophy. In exploratory reverse stepwise analyses, lower TFF3 was associated with higher rates of whole brain, hippocampal atrophy and ventricular expansion. Lower levels of CrA were associated with higher whole brain atrophy rate. The relationship between low TFF3 and increased hippocampal atrophy rate remained after adjustment for diagnosis. We identified a series of CSF markers that are independently associated with rate of neurodegeneration in amyloid-positive individuals. TFF3, a substrate for NOTCH processing may be an important biomarker of neurodegeneration across the Alzheimer spectrum.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Robert W.

We extend our work to multiple bands, achieving greater sensitivity ($\sim$ 0.4 mag) and greater speed (500x) compared to previous single-band results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of multiband PCAT on mock data, both in terms of recovering accurate posteriors in the catalog space, and in directly deblending sources. When applied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations of M2, taking Hubble Space Telescope data as truth, our joint fit on $r$ and $i$ band data goes $\sim0.4$ mag deeper than single-band probabilistic cataloging and has a false discovery rate less than 20\% for F606W$\leq 20$. Compared to DAOPHOT, the two-band SDSS catalog fit goes nearly 1.5 magnitudes deeper using the same data, and maintains a lower false discovery rate down to F606W$\sim 20.5$.

ff2338f17c427c52caa3e001dda975bc5fba8d5c,Transcriptional landscape changes during human embryonic stem cell derivation,"STUDY QUESTION
What are the transcriptional changes occurring during the human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derivation process, from the inner cell mass (ICM) to post-ICM intermediate stage (PICMI) to hESC stage, that have downstream effects on pluripotency states and differentiation?


SUMMARY ANSWER
We reveal that although the PICMI is transcriptionally similar to the hESC profile and distinct from ICM, it exhibits upregulation of primordial germ cell (PGC) markers, dependence on leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling, upregulation of naÃ¯ve pluripotency-specific signaling networks and appears to be an intermediate switching point from naÃ¯ve to primed pluripotency.


WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY
It is currently known that the PICMI exhibits markers of early and late-epiblast stage. It is suggested that hESCs acquire primed pluripotency features due to the upregulation of post-implantation genes in the PICMI which renders them predisposed towards differentiation cues. Despite this current knowledge, the transcriptional landscape changes during hESC derivation from ICM to hESC and the effect of PICMI on pluripotent state is still not well defined.


STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION
To gain insight into the signaling mechanisms that may govern the ICM to PICMI to hESC transition, comparative RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was performed on preimplantation ICMs, PICMIs and hESCs in biological and technical triplicates (n = 3).


PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, AND METHODS
Primed hESCs (XX) were maintained in feeder-free culture conditions on Matrigel for two passages and approximately 50 cells were collected in biological and technical triplicates (n = 3). For ICM sample collection, Day 3, frozen-thawed human embryos were cultured up to day five blastocyst stage and only good quality blastocysts were subjected to laser-assisted micromanipulation for ICM collection (n = 3). Next, day six expanded blastocysts were cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts and manual dissection was performed on the PICMI outgrowths between post-plating Day 6 and Day 10 (n = 3). Sequencing of these samples was performed on NextSeq500 and statistical analysis was performed using edgeR (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05).


MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE
Comparative RNA-seq data analysis revealed that 634 and 560 protein-coding genes were significantly up and downregulated in hESCs compared to ICM (FDR < 0.05), respectively. Upon ICM to PICMI transition, 471 genes were expressed significantly higher in the PICMI compared to ICM, while 296 genes were elevated in the ICM alone (FDR < 0.05). Principle component analysis showed that the ICM was completely distinct from the PICMI and hESCs while the latter two clustered in close proximity to each other. Increased expression of E-CADHERIN1 (CDH1) in ICM and intermediate levels in the PICMI was observed, while CDH2 was higher in hESCs, suggesting a role of extracellular matrix components in facilitating pluripotency transition during hESC derivation. The PICMI also showed regulation of naÃ¯ve-specific LIF and bone morphogenetic protein signaling, differential regulation of primed pluripotency-specific fibroblast growth factor and NODAL signaling pathway components, upregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (PI3K/AKT/mTORC), as well as predisposition towards the germ cell lineage, further confirmed by gene ontology analysis. Hence, the data suggest that the PICMI may serve as an intermediate pluripotency stage which, when subjected to an appropriate culture niche, could aid in enhancing naÃ¯ve hESC derivation and germ cell differentiation efficiency.


LARGE-SCALE DATA
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Accession number GSE119378.


LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION
Owing to the limitation in sample availability, the sex of ICM and PICMI have not been taken into consideration. Obtaining cells from the ICM and maintaining them in culture is not feasible as it will hamper the formation of PICMI and hESC derivation. Single-cell quantitative real-time PCR on low ICM and PICMI cell numbers, although challenging due to limited availability of human embryos, will be advantageous to further corroborate the RNA-seq data on transcriptional changes during hESC derivation process.


WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS
We elucidate the dynamics of transcriptional network changes from the naÃ¯ve ICM to the intermediate PICMI stage and finally the primed hESC lines. We provide an in-depth understanding of the PICMI and its role in conferring the type of pluripotent state which may have important downstream effects on differentiation, specifically towards the PGC lineage.

cd5245f8c30dc533eec012a1a8e4881d8f712d5a,Changes in Serum Fatty Acid Levels During the First Year After Bariatric Surgery,"BackgroundWe have assessed the effects of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and biliopancratic diversion with a duodenal switch (BPDDS) on fatty acid (FA) levels in serum. In particular, we examine the impact of surgery on the ratio of the FAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to arachidonic acid (AA) which impacts, e.g., cardiovascular health. Our hypothesis is that LSG and BPDDS influence the FA levels but that BPDDS may have a more persistent impact since BPDSS superimposes intestinal malabsorption on gastric restriction.MethodsSerum samples after overnight fasting were collected 3Â months and 1Â day before surgery and 3Â days, 3Â months, and 12Â months after surgery from 10 BPDDS patients and 23 LSG patients. The levels of 16 FAs were quantified by gas chromatography. Preoperative and postoperative concentrations of EPA and AA and the ratio of EPA to AA were compared by Wilcoxon signed-rank test corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate.ResultsThe ratio of EPA/AA at each of the three postoperative sampling points was lower than at the two preoperative sampling points for BPDDS with pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 after correcting significance levels for multiple testing. For LSG, the ratio was lower with pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 at 3Â days and at 3Â months after surgery, but not after 12Â months.ConclusionBoth LSG and BPDDS lower the ratio of EPA/AA significantly and below recommended values, but LSG patients resurge toward normal values after approximately 12Â months, while BPDDS patients do not.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chenchen Lin"", ids = ""7528477""); list(name = ""Villy VÃ¥ge"", ids = ""4091294""); list(name = ""Svein Are MjÃ¸s"", ids = ""1398971233""); list(name = ""Olav Martin Kvalheim"", ids = ""5870381"")",b0e1fbe5578f78b9c126b4628cf6e169ea0eb9f9; 0d56e76911ddce3092256cf486cdfb6661a86b98; 5760bf0f0f6f5160cd9bd53a4debe8a938a6dbdd; 5c9fa5d60291e59023e78c17597b6014d4c305cb,96d71c955764db2f00a30dfdf583ce9783e2245e; e2e21b0735d33acf994d02d32ae9c614b45e1494; 2e3670cd0091cb2ad5a01d85970bf4e6b57c1f29; 610f09a12a237e8ef3901c32b0102b21928611b2; 9b03f5f0edd6694d2eb90b8ee2081d53624c36b2; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 510e05e119df1c7dec538823adbb626334a6e30b; bdd893daab744da3cf8f54d319668a0f79634243; 02af675bf02956a1dec9bae7f4a7ea206bc89302; 35edd550106c66b5c8ac453ed1ca5d383e2753c7; cab2ead6baa720d28c70822701d6581485625f09; 44bd66ebf15a6773d57b2a40ba7b4818ec5323a9; 51100718db1337b155e57efa923d1ec4338d6875; 59d823fc9877f8d448ac4c2d90e38051026e3201; 7a2761eeba916457f7d2259ead704a9ed13bc639; 18a77f037f2a5d8478699cae3fae8bd595b0b740; ae1b4de7f64210fd138eb510daacb1207098b37c; 39a9e771df190f464887ce3c3b686ef4abfd4dc9; f9f88845178304b65777dd13b66194b71edf4ac8,Obesity Surgery,26,1735 - 1742
447d90704902bcdd825a56db372e2fe12e4604d8,Transcriptome analyses reveal reduced hepatic lipid synthesis and accumulation in more feed efficient beef cattle,"The genetic mechanisms controlling residual feed intake (RFI) in beef cattle areÂ still largely unknown. Here we performed whole transcriptome analyses to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes and their functional roles in liver tissues between six extreme high and six extreme low RFI steers from three beef breed populations including Angus, Charolais, and Kinsella Composite (KC). On average, the next generation sequencing yielded 34 million single-end reads per sample, of which 87% were uniquely mapped to the bovine reference genome. At false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05 and fold change (FC)â€‰>â€‰2, 72, 41, and 175 DE genes were identified in Angus, Charolais, and KC, respectively. Most of the DE genes were breed-specific, while five genes including TP53INP1, LURAP1L, SCD, LPIN1, and ENSBTAG00000047029 were common across the three breeds, with TP53INP1, LURAP1L, SCD, and LPIN1 being downregulated in low RFI steers of all three breeds. The DE genes are mainly involved in lipid, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, energy production, molecular transport, small molecule biochemistry, cellular development, and cell death and survival. Furthermore, our differential gene expression results suggest reduced hepatic lipid synthesis and accumulation processes in more feed efficient beef cattle of all three studied breeds.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Robert Mukiibi"", ids = ""11817039""); list(name = ""Michael Vinsky"", ids = ""7619269""); list(name = ""Kate Keogh"", ids = ""6016528""); list(name = ""Carolyn Fitzsimmons"", ids = ""47646530""); list(name = ""Paul Stothard"", ids = ""2212075""); list(name = ""SinÃ©ad M Waters"", ids = ""3956205""); list(name = ""Changxi Li"", ids = ""1687250"")",3409619016e400a56c38b90aee11993a56022af9; 24b27e11c1a93f0c6c2cdfff65196e5dc4437eeb; 53e1a9ab517c75c9a5e78ea7ec986fd7a65a6126; 881db2deab25619a320ccbbb741b17f59978b8f2; 949bc2078590617a99c1d9e5fad6762e0775aba9; 27d42aaa044ff4b51be4159eed98fc658e2182e7; b90f32349f41e68d25b492155ca9bbf090cadaad; a7b30ecff96b57b0be7cb616bac5a8d3a2b0ab23; 4b7f41f9c98ee920cfa3fb4173530cc165ed26dc; 52f56c03f19858af66c0d8ba4713aed697e16c3d; 44445ab5235241347a5780c410d7eea9f05809a9; b5975e578df511cac5dc52d3a5d145e581806078,165f346ac998aa029bbc4670f5954370b3528272; a4286bc99a3c2db34ab4ee71b2719e09e29a1477; 3e302d268d930b6309ca1546b02166fc45195afe; 6c8c52ea9d9cad157113283569d845580a39905a; 13153e150585268092907915877744b7695b3ec1; c44a85a606e6c0573ba6056a91c9c40224d0621a; 4a72d6b843488dc3720c944f7b8c132d035bbed4; 51828deba92281d34865d5b66c15c9047ff8aa8a; 0aaecb289a015bf17e82be7b719d114e18c87fc8; 331c7b6e1f54a0d52bc641db3332c12256d4fb11; 139eb4c9cd983a94bc42c52a9e7355b72e8ebb02; 5b9c6a2785995d4aa944006b8b5d579aa4a39d96; 72d6a4d9758b6ddc4c0c18cb13648bec8c1c4203; a1afb08556c0b928f3069bcb67e5bb325b53eb5b; 93229de05cc52783eb5218e5a4293a321f67e67e; 35326ceab12e74ef3d9d87c0589a713fd7e819ca; 5c4e00d5f5f9950df0069c267619cbf23d6bb7f8; 5d8687679461a8957257ba52d5914e7e215b3971; d960f7b792caab68ac2f3077ebd051a74d612bf3; 64ae26c480df8e8ec267e34f6c9b9383d23cba49; 10ee5c991494c310e6d66071f149fe305389aeff; ed4ca9e2a4c1d9d3649601f646d85b74fa458f27; 16f589a6ae37cade4a0230ea3f756a1da5d0bbeb; d4c6446446a1e69c3a3a28c825644606d66af30a; fbce00508edbe070a84a1bfcfe825d17bdf3ceff; 26ef46f2d872c680c15e8120d56875985991767a; f7630a521d04d31060264d3c7fb72bc1d7772375; a992c8fd24587f12d41f48df84b29d847634c0e4; efaa76bfa80273121542f3a32e97940c0b21c0a3; 9a75e09270a0646a56025d11488475367319167d; fe5df45f5349aa1d400b685492954f5c5572e57d; 8e0de9585cfe8143a44579bf6ab698a0805379b8; 0cd2b1545f69841d61d0f598db3e311b0546562b; 415dd3fed7fd598677abdb49c39d6f9fbfd4715f; f498f59c309d7db71a776c63ed62792de7dba0a5; 482d4d78211be39b7f67a59d6a3c0c6b083877ed; 8d9d3a4b91f4184f850f8808b854347d52254b80; 9c1f4bcad09543030526a24d96ffe367d3a5748c; 16e97774ad033c671014c53e64ff7818a60f2cad; 7af1b4fe3c23be69fd5b44fbe72b732320824366; 9e26daf62466b1b183a999d2426c56102dd66ee9; 2818b8c66f33ab798dbea3240d6b79dd74aa00ac; f72a9f8e635e31f57dafb11f39d7b4beb10ecef2; 19ffed11390fd4fffa1591a93ca3d3bbe0b91e18; 8370ddf6f52fbfe5604704646ddb30c32d671c11; c772992b5dcc58119806ae6acde88b92b6326887; 081620841afe2b84c835724e139d4a5a0bbaaa59; 825c66e38b9ab5da0a8b8c5952e614fd341468ef; 3ee19df5eb69c79530addd80828530e430b60d63; 86e01c08ecd587ca2ca3ca219f3975dfce25aeef; 2bbb05640a79fb9704fb62289eb2de81ee154b7e; f2804f53b22c4952c37a9a256ac874a9d1f57194; fe5a0deb93684363669099fb8affe4f0877c84a6; 303e936f367602ee3556fefafb7a41ee65ce1738; b6636b4e6b1d817333893d3795278d4f5d5eda0d; 60f4fbd7ed887b737e09820126ee62ac95f35649; 43d8325f28711b6e6dc2435868f52e7a9e466263; fceac5194689bf55e4cfd3c706a95a1336740449; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 93b15196ab33bd9cd2a91252cc8956964f5c7cd8; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 46404ff63e45fe53f044f467f25e7522c19e555b,Scientific Reports,8,
c0dc3d925c89984e7563981fcca99073fa09045b,"Subgingival Microbiota and Longitudinal Glucose Change: The Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance Study (ORIGINS)","Microbial communities along mucosal surfaces throughout the digestive tract are hypothesized as risk factors for impaired glucose regulation and the development of clinical cardiometabolic disease. We investigated whether baseline measures of subgingival microbiota predicted fasting plasma glucose (FPG) longitudinally. The Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance Study (ORIGINS) enrolled 230 diabetes-free adults (77% female) aged 20 to 55 y (mean Â± SD, 34 Â± 10 y) from whom baseline subgingival plaque and longitudinal FPG were measured. DNA was extracted from subgingival plaque, and V3 to V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. FPG was measured at baseline and again at 2 y; glucose change was defined as follow-up minus baseline. Multivariable linear models regressed 2-y glucose change onto baseline measures of community diversity and abundances of 369 individual taxa. A microbial dysbiosis index (MDI) summarizing top individual taxa associated with glucose change was calculated and used in regression models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, body mass index, and baseline glucose levels. Statistical significance was based on the false discovery rate (FDR; <0.05) or a Bonferroni-corrected P value of 1 Ã— 10-4, derived from the initial 369 hypothesis tests for specific taxa. Mean 2-y FPG change was 1.5 Â± 8 mg/dL. Baseline levels of 9 taxa predicted FPG change (all FDR <0.05), among which Stomatobaculum sp oral taxon 097 and Atopobium spp predicted greater FPG change, while Leptotrichia sp oral taxon 498 predicted lesser FPG change (all 3 P values, Bonferroni significant). The MDI explained 6% of variation in longitudinal glucose change (P < 0.001), and baseline glucose levels explained 10% of variation (P < 0.0001).

dbf8c8f917cfb11c1f154a99c2cb5cbefbd3babd,Optimizing power to track brain degeneration in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment with tensor-based morphometry: An ADNI study of 515 subjects,"Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) is a powerful method to map the 3D profile of brain degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We optimized a TBM-based image analysis method to determine what methodological factors, and which image-derived measures, maximize statistical power to track brain change. 3D maps, tracking rates of structural atrophy over time, were created from 1030 longitudinal brain MRI scans (1-year follow-up) of 104 AD patients (age: 75.7+/-7.2 years; MMSE: 23.3+/-1.8, at baseline), 254 amnestic MCI subjects (75.0+/-7.2 years; 27.0+/-1.8), and 157 healthy elderly subjects (75.9+/-5.1 years; 29.1+/-1.0), as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). To determine which TBM designs gave greatest statistical power, we compared different linear and nonlinear registration parameters (including different regularization functions), and different numerical summary measures derived from the maps. Detection power was greatly enhanced by summarizing changes in a statistically-defined region-of-interest (ROI) derived from an independent training sample of 22 AD patients. Effect sizes were compared using cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots and false discovery rate methods. In power analyses, the best method required only 48 AD and 88 MCI subjects to give 80% power to detect a 25% reduction in the mean annual change using a two-sided test (at alpha=0.05). This is a drastic sample size reduction relative to using clinical scores as outcome measures (619 AD/6797 MCI for the ADAS-Cog, and 408 AD/796 MCI for the Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes scores). TBM offers high statistical power to track brain changes in large, multi-site neuroimaging studies and clinical trials of AD.",2009,Psychology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Xue Hua"", ids = ""145362549""); list(name = ""Suh Young Lee"", ids = ""3024266""); list(name = ""Igor Yanovsky"", ids = ""2344878""); list(name = ""Alex D.

468094978f79c9cd68866344f3bd0e7b93eaf9ae,GIPR expression in gastric and duodenal neuroendocrine tumors.,"BACKGROUND
Compounds targeting somatostatin-receptor-type-2 (SSTR2) are useful for small bowel neuroendocrine tumor (SBNET) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) imaging and treatment. We recently characterized expression of 13 cell surface receptorÂ genes in SBNETs and PNETs, identifying three drug targets (GIPR, OXTR, andÂ OPRK1). ThisÂ study set out to characterize expression of this gene panel in the less common neuroendocrine tumors of the stomach and duodenum (gastric and duodenal neuroendocrine tumors [GDNETs]).


METHODS
Primary tumors and adjacent normal tissue were collected at surgery, RNA was extracted, and expression of 13 target genes was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Expression was normalized to GAPDH and POLR2A internal control genes. Expression relative to normal tissue (ddCT) and absolute expression (dCT) were calculated. Wilcoxon tests compared median expression with false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
Gene expression was similar in two gastric and seven duodenal tumors, and theseÂ were analyzed together. Like SBNETs (nÂ =Â 63) and PNETs (nÂ =Â 51), GDNETs showed significant overexpression compared with normal tissue of BRS3, GIPR, GRM1, GPR113, OPRK1, and SSTR2 (PÂ <Â 0.05 for all). Of these, SSTR2 had the highest absolute expression in GDNETs (median dCT 4.0). Absolute expression of BRS3, GRM1, GPR113, and OPRK1 was significantly lower than SSTR2 in GDNETs (PÂ <Â 0.05 for all), whereas expression of GIPR was similar to SSTR2 (median 4.3, PÂ =Â 0.4).


CONCLUSIONS
As in SBNETs and PNETs, GIPR shows absolute expression close to SSTR2Â butÂ has greater overexpression relative to normal tissue (21.1 versus 3.5-fold overexpression). We conclude that GIPR could provide an improved signal-to-noise ratioÂ for imaging versus SSTR2 and represents a promising novel therapeutic target in GDNETs.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Scott K.

These formulas are ``explicit'' in the sense that they only involve the parameters of the model and elementary operations. The $p$-values are assumed either independent or coming from an equicorrelated multivariate normal model and an additional mixture model for the true/false hypotheses is used. We propose several applications of theses formulas. In particular, some new results related to least/most favorable configurations for the FDR and the variance of the FDP are presented.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Etienne Roquain"", ids = ""3117456""); list(name = ""Fanny Villers"", ids = ""1907804"")",37f6545085e7dcddf483728d17113013a86a3165; 275a6c6ee2badd48096441e3174f9ed86926dee7,,,,

05f00352a82d3ba7073294872de26b58185969dd,Genome-wide association study of SSRI/SNRI-induced sexual dysfunction in a Japanese cohort with major depression,"Sexual dysfunction is a major side effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify the genetic factors contributing to the risk of SSRI/SNRI-induced sexual dysfunction by testing 186 320 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in a cohort of 201 Japanese major depression patients including 36 with sexual dysfunction induced by SSRI (paroxetine or fluvoxamine) or SNRI (milnacipran). The Cochran-Armitage trend test showed that 11 SNPs, tightly clustered in a distinct region on chromosome 14q21.3, were associated with SSRI/SNRI-induced sexual dysfunction at a genome-wide significance level after false discovery rate (FDR) correction, and the strongest SNP association was with rs1160351 (P=3.04 Ã— 10(-7), risk ratio=2.92, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.79-4.76). These SNPs mapped to the intronic region of the MDGA2 gene. A Manhattan plot showed that the strong association peak remained in MDGA2 after adjustment for sex and age in a multivariable logistic regression analysis although P values increased slightly and became non-significant. Replication studies with larger sample sizes are required to validate this exploratory study, but our findings may provide insights into the genetic basis of sexual dysfunction induced by SSRI/SNRI.",2012,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kouichi Kurose"", ids = ""2325483""); list(name = ""Kazuyuki Hiratsuka"", ids = ""50490802""); list(name = ""Kazuya Ishiwata"", ids = ""35974713""); list(name = ""Jun Nishikawa"", ids = ""81644120""); list(name = ""Yoshiro Saito"", ids = ""50069038"")",ccfd06d1a0c92f9fd6234bf54edffb3880594a37; be294acf31a0d4262e07965a015e52ee8966a474; 64e5a56252ef17396094e02a5bb6afbf735edb8e; 5402b1b14f8665e875f2fb627e62ca8e0e63f546; 90b312534277e73ae04ff291bc8157f964743b0c; 57bd37c75b68f4269c3dae8ca6286af1113fb424; 6b4e3118e775209e39b6f7b8b217e2cda89cf991; 5732229ba974106a596959c55ffb9962f33accfb; d334e3e05b902f7aafc5d4dc6e7addb8dedd8ebb,,Psychiatry Research,198,424-429
854777da485a88df61d76e049b269c5a43e4cecc,A genome-wide association study for susceptibility and infectivity of Holstein Friesian dairy cattle to digital dermatitis.,"Selection and breeding can be used to fight transmission of infectious diseases in livestock. The prevalence in a population depends on the susceptibility and infectivity of the animals. Knowledge on the genetic background of those traits would facilitate efficient selection for lower disease prevalence. We investigated the genetic background of host susceptibility and infectivity for digital dermatitis (DD), an endemic infectious claw disease in dairy cattle, with a genome-wide association study (GWAS), using either a simple linear mixed model or a generalized linear mixed model based on epidemiological theory. In total, 1,513 Holstein-Friesian cows of 12 Dutch dairy farms were scored for DD infection status and class (M0 to M4.1) every 2 wk for 11 times; 1,401 of these cows were genotyped with a 75k SNP chip. We performed a GWAS with a linear mixed model on 10 host disease status traits, and with a generalized linear mixed model with a complementary log-log link function (GLMM) on the probability that a cow would get infected between 2 scorings. With the GLMM, we fitted SNP effects for host susceptibility and host infectivity, while taking the variation in exposure of the susceptible cow to infectious herd mates into account. With the linear model we detected 4 suggestive SNP (false discovery rate < 0.20), 2 for the fraction of observations a cow had an active lesion on chromosomes 1 and 14, one for the fraction of observations a cow had an M2 lesion on at least one claw on chromosome 1 (the same SNP as for the fraction of observations with an active lesion), and one for the fraction of observations a cow had an M4.1 lesion on at least one claw on chromosome 10. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.09 to 0.37. With the GLMM we did not detect significant nor suggestive SNP. The SNP effects on disease status analyzed with the linear model had a correlation coefficient of only 0.70 with SNP effects on susceptibility of the GLMM, indicating that both models capture partly different effects. Because the GLMM better accounts for the epidemiological mechanisms determining individual disease status and for the distribution of the y-variable, results of the GLMM may be more reliable, despite the absence of suggestive associations. We expect that with an extended GLMM that better accounts for the full genetic variation in infectivity via the environment, the accuracy of SNP effects may increase.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Floor Biemans"", ids = ""19238570""); list(name = ""Mart C M de Jong"", ids = ""144198174""); list(name = ""P.

A universe of 7650 trading rules is applied to six currencies quoted in U.S. dollars over the 1994:3â€“2014:12 period. The Barras, Scaillet, and Wermers (2010) false discovery rate method is employed to deal with data snooping and it detects almost all outperforming trading rules while keeping the proportion of false discoveries to a pre-specified level. The out-of-sample results reveal a large number of outperforming rules that are profitable over short periods based on the Sharpe ratio. However, they are not consistently profitable and so the overall results are more consistent with the adaptive markets hypothesis.",2017,Economics,"list(name = ""Nima Zarrabi"", ids = ""122142793""); list(name = ""Stuart Snaith"", ids = ""103063209""); list(name = ""Jerry Coakley"", ids = ""145127635"")",3854445c8ef72c7b609231098cd40ae973da6a89; f5b07a2ef27fc544fff9ae800f508e7cf0a36941; f2927b20e7e8a39934e623b9424bc6e452f8a0a2; 8729aaaadcc6015ab61e8dca27baa689d6c5ee1a; c39d6d12a6f4acbcb826a3ccf86c55f252a47557,dd7d038d1b1127f46a71faf2cef13c9d297ce980; 6ac4064925decc3c55d660bec8b13e4d118bb575; 28e80b94fe79b44599da9b4d72a0977ca08ad5d6; fd79b83fedb087030b2e770ba27031193062547f; 059ff4ea91c577fff7f8de127ea09d8912aa7ef2; f4ca598829b59828d63adc5891b1a40fc81282a1; 23b250895f5823b4842638ee2fac124d9a406331; 4a8ab6cfd8d5fdd7af7c43621c34128e5ea43f91; 32d3a4759df23fd94399491576c16a8a1a345d8a; 00cb1b905d155793a9b20d8d11d322f05a3169b6; 878f4e64b3a48d76a22132b52d27a25e54b87203; 9b3cb8d184e2198ec08b6645dbb940a57769b2e0; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; a4ffd51b84108b119ea6593d6f55643730a8de10; d0520f11b55392c010fa048e3186b7512ef9e9e9; 353ef2de13f07a7d7489ad84feee1679da481a6e; c80f838f41fb428426c5f06a29c34def76d4992b; a3f6cd43b6eaf80220bd7fd60d16a3aed1871b37; f78d9aee2896b86f90b59d08313d4ee8572bad4f; 37906587dad13770392f474e423ea7f9d275ba53; c128ef84b7839ab82fb88729f14a428e4b12f6d6; 8bae6b51024b64999898a152a0129ed9009a6979; 83d10adb98319ab3fcc15dfa44dd3f7ff80e4bda; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; dc9e58df9b1bdbb14657c396f6644c4a9d0afbe4; f59d0cdd4e21fe54d8c2a320ff45bcf4da90b295; 73ab8322cc089ae806f0a896891854da798ba619; 8546f2abcebc9f8003205704895fa5a2971fed55; ec03f6a9cdc662c84a52fef9b7769a3588223c9b; e5716dce14b3a69b44825852cc2ca4ca952e4a72; 23dd908ff5b3d90f53814e0f295c7889e2f73af7; 5e0bbe09d00f078eeb6b2d431c7be0c0d1ab8cea; 2e518ed02b2ea53d8deebe62b9519ea2f712ad1c; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 733c60263ee6d42e03b19801345e02937ab874ba; a274685cebe6e1e608982cbf676a5cb7e26fdc0a,International Review of Financial Analysis,49,113-127

Several studies have also found an inhibitory effect of clopidogrel on inflammation. Although platelets are known to participate in inflammatory processes, the mechanism(s) through which clopidogrel might modify platelet-mediated inflammation is unknown. We examined the platelet transcriptome to gain insight into the mechanism(s) through which clopidogrel modulates inflammation.

Methods Three individuals with subclinical atherosclerosis and family history of early onset coronary artery disease were enrolled. Blood was collected for RNA-seq at baseline and one-week after clopidogrel 75mg daily. RNA was extracted from leukocyte-depleted platelet-rich plasma and approximately 70 million 100bp paired-end reads per sample were obtained using the Illumina HiSeq 2500. RNA-seq analysis was performed using Bowtie/TopHat/Cufflinks software pipeline. Genes with expression â‰¥ 0.3 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads (FPKM) were considered to be expressed. We set the threshold for significant differential expression as â‰¥ 2-fold change in gene expression after clopidogrel therapy with a false discovery rate of 0.05.

Results The study sample consisted of 2 women and 1 man. Among the 12,297 expressed genes, the most highly expressed nonubiquitous genes included PPBP, PF4, and TUBB1, confirming platelets as the source of the RNA. Comparing samples before and after clopidogrel, treatment was associated with up-regulation of 733 genes and down-regulation of 387 genes. Pathway analyses found that genes related to platelet activation, degranulation, and aggregation were up-regulated, while genes related to immune system processes, such as B- and T-cell activation and innate immune response, were down-regulated. Examples of down-regulated genes include the toll-like receptor family genes, TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR8, the chemokine receptor genes CCR2, CCR5,CCR6, and CCR7, and the interleukin receptor genes, IL4R, IL7R, and IL13RA.

Conclusion One week of clopidogrel therapy up-regulates transcription of pro-thrombotic platelet genes and down regulates transcription of inflammation-related platelet genes. These data suggest that clopidogrel may exert a direct anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting the ability of platelets to participate in inflammatory processes. The relationship of variability in clopidogrel-induced modulation of these pathways to clinical outcomes is unknown.

0ad3b408256ca0afd1b1305a02611bf55e3d894e,Interstitial fibrosis scored on whole-slide digital imaging of kidney biopsies is a predictor of outcome in proteinuric glomerulopathies,"Background
Interstitial fibrosis (IF), tubular atrophy (TA) and interstitial inflammation (II) are known determinants of progression of renal disease. Standardized quantification of these features could add value to current classification of glomerulopathies.


Methods
We studied 315 participants in the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) study, including biopsy-proven minimal change disease (MCD = 98), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS = 121), membranous nephropathy (MNâ€‰=â€‰59) and IgA nephropathy (IgAN = 37). Cortical IF, TA and II were quantified (%) on digitized whole-slide biopsy images, by five pathologists with high inter-reader agreement (intra-class correlation coefficient >0.8). Tubulointerstitial messenger RNA expression was measured in a subset of patients. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were fit to assess association of IF with the composite of 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and separately as well, and with complete remission (CR) of proteinuria.


Results
IF was highly correlated with TA (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and II (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Median IF varied by diagnosis: FSGS 17, IgAN 21, MN 7, MCD 1 (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). IF was strongly correlated with baseline eGFR (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and proteinuria (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002). After adjusting for clinical pathologic diagnosis, age, race, global glomerulosclerosis, baseline proteinuria, eGFR and medications, each 10% increase in IF was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.29 (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.03) for ESRD/40% eGFR decline, but was not significantly associated with CR. A total of 981 genes were significantly correlated with IF (|r| > 0.4, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01), including upstream regulators such as tumor necrosis factor, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-B1), and signaling pathways for antigen presentation and hepatic fibrosis.


Conclusions
The degree of IF is associated with risk of eGFR decline across different types of proteinuric glomerulopathy, correlates with inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression, and may have predictive value in assessing risk of progression.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Laura H.

a756c34256122418b1db6d00a0c120238936a6f5,Precursor ion independent algorithm for top-down shotgun proteomics,"We present a precursor ion independent top-down algorithm (PIITA) for use in automated assignment of protein identifications from tandem mass spectra of whole proteins. To acquire the data, we utilize data-dependent acquisition to select protein precursor ions eluting from a C4-based HPLC column for collision induced dissociation in the linear ion trap of an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Gas-phase fractionation is used to increase the number of acquired tandem mass spectra, all of which are recorded in the Orbitrap mass analyzer. To identify proteins, the PIITA algorithm compares deconvoluted, deisotoped, observed tandem mass spectra to all possible theoretical tandem mass spectra for each protein in a genomic sequence database without regard for measured parent ion mass. Only after a protein is identified, is any difference in measured and theoretical precursor mass used to identify and locate post-translation modifications. We demonstrate the application of PIITA to data generated via our wet-lab approach on a Salmonella typhimurium outer membrane extract and compare these results to bottom-up analysis. From these data, we identify 154 proteins by top-down analysis, 73 of which were not identified in a parallel bottom-up analysis. We also identify 201 unique isoforms of these 154 proteins at a false discovery rate (FDR) of <1%.",2009,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Yihsuan Shannon Tsai"", ids = ""12906030""); list(name = ""Alexander Scherl"", ids = ""3971869""); list(name = ""Jason L.

2ba06bf5e8ff3a7b0354b14cb2d733606c41bf5f,Cardiovascular Benefits of Fish-Oil Supplementation Against Fine Particulate Air Pollution in China.,"BACKGROUND
Few studies have evaluated the health benefits of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation against fine particulate matter (aerodynamic diameterÂ <2.5 Î¼m [PM2.5]) exposure in highly polluted areas.


OBJECTIVES
The authors sought to evaluate whether dietary fish-oil supplementation protects cardiovascular health against PM2.5 exposure in China.


METHODS
This is a randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial among 65 healthy college students in Shanghai, China. Participants were randomly assigned to either the placebo group or the intervention group with dietary fish-oil supplementation of 2.5 g/day from September 2017 to January 2018, and received 4 rounds of health examinations in the last 2Â months of treatments. Fixed-site PM2.5 concentrations on campus were measured in real time. The authors measured blood pressure and 18 biomarkers of systematic inflammation, coagulation, endothelial function, oxidative stress, antioxidant activity, cardiometabolism, and neuroendocrine stress response. Acute effects of PM2.5 on these outcomes were evaluated within each group using linear mixed-effect models.


RESULTS
The average PM2.5 level was 38 Î¼g/m3 during the study period. Compared with the placebo group, the fish-oil group showed relatively stable levels of most biomarkers in response to changes in PM2.5 exposure. Between-group differences associated with PM2.5 exposure varied by biomarkers and by lags of exposure. The authors observed beneficial effects of fish-oil supplementation on 5 biomarkers of blood inflammation, coagulation, endothelial function, oxidative stress, and neuroendocrine stress response in the fish-oil group at a false discovery rate ofÂ <0.05.


CONCLUSIONS
This trial shows that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation is associated with short-term subclinical cardiovascular benefits against PM2.5 exposure among healthy young adults in China.

95209d875486c5ee71e6627ccd4ad697b052500a,Another perspective on voxel-wise multiple testing procedures in fMRI,"Introduction: We review 3 widely used voxel-wise approaches to thresholding images of test statistics: Bonferroni (BF), Gaussian random field (GRF) and Benjamini-Hochberg (BH). While the latter controls the false discovery rate (FDR), the first two control the family-wise error rate (FWE). Comparisons of multiple testing procedures (MTP) in the neuroimaging literature have typically focused on sensitivity and specificity. However, stability (Gordon et al., 2007) is another important operating characteristic that needs to be taken into account. Here, we define stability as the variability due to the MTP in the detection of truly activated voxels. Methods: Following Marchini and Presanis (2004), we simulated 3D Gaussian random fields using a FWHM ranging from 20 mm to 50 mm and voxel dimensions of 4 X 4 X 6 mm. To these â€œnullâ€ SPMs, we added positive activation by simulating an extra GRF and transforming all voxels marginally to have a Gamma(k,1) distribution (k ranging from 3 to 7). The images had dimensions 40 X 40 X 10, and of the 16000 voxels, 400 were positively activated. Each simulation setting was repeated 1000 times. First, the performance of BF and GRF was compared at fixed theoretical levels of the FWE (ranging from 0.01 to 0.10). Next, to allow for a fair comparison of BF and GRF with BH, thresholds were determined for each procedure that result in an equal empirical FDR on average (for different levels of the FDR ranging from 0.01 to 0.10). Using these thresholds that equalized the FDR on average, we explored the number of true discoveries and its variability for each MTP. Results: When equalizing the theoretical FWE, GRF outperforms BF in terms of mean number of true discoveries, but tends to be more variable with decreasing effect size (for the range of smoothness values considered in this simulation setting). Figures 1 and 2 show the standard deviation of the true discoveries as a function of the mean for 10 levels of the FWE (0.01 to 0.10 in steps of 0.01) for large and small effects respectively (each symbol representing a different FWE). Overall, the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean) is smaller for GRF than for BF. When equalizing the empirical FDR, BF and GRF perform identically (as they are using exactly the same ordering of p-values). When the effect size is large (small), BH detects less (more) true activated voxels than BF=GRF, regardless of smoothness considered. In all scenarios, the variability in the number of detected voxels is larger with BH then BF=GRF. Figures 3 and 4 show the standard deviation of the true discoveries as a function of the mean for 10 levels of FDR (0.01 to 0.10 in steps of 0.01) for large and small effects respectively (each symbol representing a different FDR).Overall, the coefficient of variation is smaller for GRF=BF than BH.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Tom Loeys"", ids = ""2211817""); list(name = ""B.

Identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes across treatments is one of the major steps in RNA-seq data analysis. Most differential expression analysis methods rely on parametric assumptions, and it is not guaranteed that these assumptions are appropriate for real data analysis. In this paper, we develop a semi-parametric Bayesian approach for differential expression analysis. More specifically, we model the RNA-seq count data with a Poisson-Gamma mixture model, and propose a Bayesian mixture modeling procedure with a Dirichlet process as the prior model for the distribution of fold changes between the two treatment means. We develop Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior simulation using Metropolis Hastings algorithm to generate posterior samples for differential expression analysis while controlling false discovery rate. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other popular methods used for detecting DE genes.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Ran Bi"", ids = ""152270110""); list(name = ""Peng Liu"", ids = ""144160387"")",,d220b7869f286ff9e5344afb1572ab00feaeacd7; ac59a2ec67391bc7dcdd1618a7e9dd95f47b7511; 37cae00437f3d00a8aff2417fe6354137fc04999; 571c3ea8cabd16ab0ae7a1a3495d3f3aca918e23; eb7ba495d2adb625347448f0b30dca86f9f3d3f1; 1b32d466d2c756e1dbcef9ff94e1be895e84700d; 91e62d27c08db29cf011a0326a61509e574cf772; f5ead92648c5ff0492c04c038efe4d4a82f0d0bb; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; e70ba61fab6dfbc4506fc86ed19698cfd9db9384; 08600900eac695fdba3bf453c6f02a6bf4b7f236; e0d5fb21a599b73c56cb9fc1f3cdd8fbcc4640d9; 772f5fca88de0f6f38116d73cc32e23efe780a10; 0de91b7520de23dc3d9b32fd44559f030119c204; 143d2e02ab91ae6259576ac50b664b8647af8988; 944006623073b2ea016b1040c64a74e857974bfc; 7cae14836295b4dc43bbc66e7295658d9d4932d4; 6ba13c951fdc3cc472a8ceeba02142299236f1f4; 87ccc438b0c73fcfdea48485fcdb091a8ecaa89c; 555daedf3625fc0b01598303d6fdc557d8a097fc; 9c67f30235a47e305dc57c9f185d5587faca4236; be9e72f6d5d852da757d821230daadddbc58c8bd; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; cdb6d57f4e94b017f4400d518b5bf42e7e76bf6d,bioRxiv,,

The aim of the current study is to analyze the differences between mPDAC of the head and mPDAC of the body-tail, both in prognostic and predictive terms in patients with mPDAC receiving palliative chemotherapy. Data of patients with a diagnosis of mPDAC and receiving chemotherapy (CHT), registered in the database of the division of Medical Oncology of the Ospedale Civile di Sanremo, were analyzed. Thirty-two variables were extracted, and their relationship with primary tumor site and outcome were analyzed. One hundred twenty-nine patients were eligible. The characteristics of patients were different between those with the primary tumor of the pancreatic head or body-tail. After construction of two Cox models, two prognostic factors (the number of CHT lines, the neutrophil reduction after one cycle of CHT) were identified as independent among mPDAC of the head, while only one variables (the number of drugs in the CHT regimen) predicted the outcome of patients with body-tail tumors; after statistical correction for false discovery rate, all the three variables maintained their significant relationship with OS.

757e78eba810280beab4722994bf804366af8113,DNA methylation as a marker for prenatal smoke exposure in adults,"Background
Prenatal smoke exposure is known to be robustly associated with DNA methylation among offspring in early life, but whether the association persists into adulthood is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the long-term effect of maternal smoke exposure on DNA methylation in 754 women (mean age 30â€‰years); to replicate findings in the same women 18â€‰years later and in a cohort of 230 men (mean age 53â€‰years); and to assess the extent to which a methylation score could predict prenatal smoke exposure.


Methods
We first carried out an epigenome-wide association analysis for prenatal smoke exposure and performed replication analyses for the top CpG sites in the other samples. We derived a DNA methylation score based on previously identified CpG sites and generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to assess the performance of these scores as predictors of prenatal smoke exposure.


Results
We observed associations at 15 CpG sites in 11 gene regions: MYO1G, FRMD4A, CYP1A1, CNTNAP2, ARL4C, AHRR, TIFAB, MDM4, AX748264, DRD1, FTO (false discovery rateâ€‰<5%). Most of these associations were specific to exposure during pregnancy, were present 18â€‰years later and were replicated in a cohort of men. A DNA methylation score could predict prenatal smoke exposure (30â€‰years previously) with an area under the curve of 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.69, 0.76).

309260a951b30c410c5dfdedb7ee0eeb3374ba1a,Adverse remodeling of the electrophysiological response to ischemia-reperfusion in human heart failure is associated with remodeling of metabolic gene expression.,"BACKGROUND
Ventricular arrhythmias occur more frequently in heart failure during episodes of ischemia-reperfusion although the mechanisms underlying this in humans are unclear. We assessed, in explanted human hearts, the remodeled electrophysiological response to acute ischemia-reperfusion in heart failure and its potential causes, including the remodeling of metabolic gene expression.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We optically mapped coronary-perfused left ventricular wedge preparations from 6 human end-stage failing hearts (F) and 6 donor hearts rejected for transplantation (D). Preparations were subjected to 30 minutes of global ischemia, followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. Failing hearts had exaggerated electrophysiological responses to ischemia-reperfusion, with greater action potential duration shortening (P<0.001 at 8-minute ischemia; P=0.001 at 12-minute ischemia) and greater conduction slowing during ischemia, delayed recovery of electric excitability after reperfusion (F, 4.8Â±1.8 versus D, 1.0Â±0 minutes; P<0.05), and incomplete restoration of action potential duration and conduction velocity early after reperfusion. Expression of 46 metabolic genes was probed using custom-designed TaqMan arrays, using extracted RNA from 15 failing and 9 donor hearts. Ten genes important in cardiac metabolism were downregulated in heart failure, with SLC27A4 and KCNJ11 significantly downregulated at a false discovery rate of 0%.


CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrate, for the first time in human hearts, that the electrophysiological response to ischemia-reperfusion in heart failure is accelerated during ischemia with slower recovery after reperfusion. This can enhance spatial conduction and repolarization gradients across the ischemic border and increase arrhythmia susceptibility. This adverse response was associated with downregulation of expression of cardiac metabolic genes.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Fu Siong Ng"", ids = ""39806071""); list(name = ""Katherine M.

46a3b52ebb52bc88b217723f59288f90088c594d,Adiposity-Dependent Regulatory Effects on Multi-tissue Transcriptomes,"Obesity is a global epidemic that is causally associated with a range of diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, at the population-level. However, there is marked heterogeneity in obesity-related outcomes among individuals. This might reflect genotype-dependent responses to adiposity. Given that adiposity, measured by BMI, is associated with widespread changes in gene expression and regulatory variants mediate the majority of known complex trait loci, we sought to identify gene-by-BMI (G Ã— BMI) interactions on the regulation of gene expression in a multi-tissue RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset from the TwinsUK cohort (n = 856). At a false discovery rate of 5%, we identified 16 cis G Ã— BMI interactions (top cis interaction: CHURC1, rs7143432, p = 2.0Â Ã— 10(-12)) and one variant regulating 53 genes in trans (top trans interaction: ZNF423, rs3851570, p = 8.2Â Ã— 10(-13)), all in adipose tissue. The interactions were adipose-specific and enriched for variants overlapping adipocyte enhancers, and regulated genes were enriched for metabolic and inflammatory processes. We replicated a subset of the interactions in an independent adipose RNA-seq dataset (deCODE genetics, n = 754). We also confirmed the interactions with an alternate measure of obesity, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived visceral-fat-volume measurements, in a subset of TwinsUK individuals (n = 682). The identified G Ã— BMI regulatory effects demonstrate the dynamic nature of gene regulation and reveal a functional mechanism underlying the heterogeneous response to obesity. Additionally, we have provided a web browser allowing interactive exploration of the dataset, including of association between expression, BMI, and G Ã— BMI regulatory effects in four tissues.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Craig A.

deddc4f3c850cd2eeaec7734623e155cb532c119,Data mining algorithms to improve the sensitivity and reliability for protein and protein phosphorylation identification in shotgun proteomics,"In order to overcome the high rick resulting from the model based algorithm while processing dataset with very different characteristics, data mining algorithms were developed to improve the sensitivity for peptide and protein identifications safely. A filtering criteria optimization strategy using genetic algorithm was developed for the determination of tailored filtering criteria for different datasets; and an instance based algorithm using local false discovery rate (local FDR) was developed for the estimation of peptide identification posterior probability by incorporating of k nearest neighbors algorithm and Shannon information entropy strategy. By combining phosphopeptide identification information from MS2 and its consecutive MS3 spectra, an automatic phosphopeptide identification algorithm was developed to overcome the difficulties for phosphopeptide identifications, high FDR and the fact that manual validation is highly relied for the generation of high confident phosphopeptide identifications. By using this strategy, high confidence and sensitivity were achieved for phosphopeptide identification and phosphorylation site localization without the need of manual validation even for low accuracy mass spectrometry. Then a software suite targeted for the validating and processing of phosphoproteome dataset was established to help researchers to generate high confident phosphopeptide/phosphoprotein identifications and prepare phosphoproteome dataset with sufficient information easily.

4e69c93a53e233a348e7f09db2cd687ec4f1b0ef,Tumor suppressor genes that escape from X-inactivation contribute to cancer sex bias,"There is a striking and unexplained male predominance across many cancer types. A subset of X-chromosome genes can escape X-inactivation, which would protect females from complete functional loss by a single mutation. To identify putative 'escape from X-inactivation tumor-suppressor' (EXITS) genes, we examined somatic alterations from >4,100 cancers across 21 tumor types for sex bias. Six of 783 non-pseudoautosomal region (PAR) X-chromosome genes (ATRX, CNKSR2, DDX3X, KDM5C, KDM6A, and MAGEC3) harbored loss-of-function mutations more frequently in males (based on a false discovery rate < 0.1), in comparison to zero of 18,055 autosomal and PAR genes (Fisher's exact P < 0.0001). Male-biased mutations in genes that escape X-inactivation were observed in combined analysis across many cancers and in several individual tumor types, suggesting a generalized phenomenon. We conclude that biallelic expression of EXITS genes in females explains a portion of the reduced cancer incidence in females as compared to males across a variety of tumor types.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrew Dunford"", ids = ""145522861""); list(name = ""David M.

852b505358d82aa736d25c78c079b5cd6343bf62,Shotgun Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Proteins Responding to Drought Stress in Brassica rapa L. (Inbred Line â€œChiifuâ€),"Through a comparative shotgun quantitative proteomics analysis in Brassica rapa (inbred line Chiifu), total of 3,009 nonredundant proteins were identified with a false discovery rate of 0.01 in 3-week-old plants subjected to dehydration treatment for 0, 24, and 48 h, plants subjected to drought stress. Ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylases, chlorophyll a/b-binding protein, and light harvesting complex in photosystem II were highly abundant proteins in the leaves and accounted for 9%, 2%, and 4%, respectively, of the total identified proteins. Comparative analysis of the treatments enabled detection of 440 differentially expressed proteins during dehydration. The results of clustering analysis, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, and analysis of composite expression profiles of functional categories for the differentially expressed proteins indicated that drought stress reduced the levels of proteins associated with photosynthesis and increased the levels of proteins involved in catabolic processes and stress responses. We observed enhanced expression of many proteins involved in osmotic stress responses and proteins with antioxidant activities. Based on previously reported molecular functions, we propose that the following five differentially expressed proteins could provide target genes for engineering drought resistance in plants: annexin, phospholipase D delta, sDNA-binding transcriptional regulator, auxin-responsive GH3 family protein, and TRAF-like family protein.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Soon-Wook Kwon"", ids = ""47595484""); list(name = ""Mijeong Kim"", ids = ""40652931""); list(name = ""Hijin Kim"", ids = ""3663081""); list(name = ""Joohyun Lee"", ids = ""38294753"")",60c0a25d16c36626ec6dec991bd446a8e8acecb4; a0ef4a20de9207454d2bd6d38b23c57c8e7c3630; 3580d7096a2be84c40b82ab72aff32e36b22bf83; 3efa589acc21bf59de1f4f34aeaad70ca551e04a; d373cc66f5172b58e2601150d92eaffca5b7bf8d,4d8e712a9a9b454093d0d336b48bed31af880ece; ec76e90ced37c46d7a81d4410979c6510f9d07a9; 771f70ef00d0ce7a1850e88531bfe6d35246ed5c; 81092e8816c5e2c7e9869a87a7f319b75a47f3a6; 1a6567f4a76fc41dee61322d46d0f70997c99c88; f3d5cbf7e1a9e61d515d05f60e4e31e64e6690b4; 65bf3728e582446bdadc3be56f5d50cdeb1c6f70; e6e6cef7148c923c893fa94d047f838433887ade; ad6305a317fa58552925a06102d79a2cce778fa7; 6a7186ecb29e50d24802f967ae00d87fe2fbceed; 88387371ae0e3920b97c4c2649e8a7ae998c3095; 0c9bbe7bbe6b8be6d8607c6a5984726cab9879e6; a9ab3314e377787fc4a394b06cf9da6877c8040b; b31113ff4597e75f6fe14bc197cf6719a68b72e7; 70f11a5ed6bd3c5d8cffd80f06eba8f7f561d302; 696088b7b64c0baa6be89232394de891c95fe750; f5358ca600032cdb2db36470f69aca325b0c6b77; 04804acfb8c426a84978dd2f05c0b6ddd3959075; 496d1a7ffd07e4d6ffe0067cac5329cf0a6b25ea; 1ae856dc44cb423624a5cd25f8dab92b86aa4fe2; 387b8d22aebfc0db2f2b360808021685b0e5d742; 42365804218771becfe693375e0bf346d2736db6; 045ff1346799e361b6e69dd918fc4142e0175522; ae268beef4f0e777b1dffbb213b97c23da40d807; 1e568ae9bec3f6a5c3876aab0a3e78b8d0fa4c41; 5daab3821cd712eb25a04df4a7e709b1e15bdd7d; 84afa5042df648af692db298b2b70c4d14ad29a1; 933e11db848c8941bd4fd74fdeb27e0a83eae270; b74eafbb334dadee82f27bcd57c9a7fbd65f57d7; 99d127a448b9b427b2193c95191a3dc9d9de2945; 2deb2a3b56aec5bd204d514ed296840d10866509; 6eeee2e9ad27afac19834e2b09d7358e6b363a65; 77c6f58c7d48a4c70355b63d20fe2a0cc0367e80; 5aed05ced445fed9cc64fa39279391152fc522b4; ce5f2ba388048738edf94cdc1f79b1f1c2ffce2a; b8a202d9554b6b275f84ffdf6e118af7336e71d0; 9e61a2515807d1c7cc6a81327072f4520b47978b; 161ef47b4f73a552afbf92db1b738861b3986554; a461d5dca8bd6ba6a5fa2db291e56b2c098e575a; ba2f5300070c1f6b86320f91dfb825084ea7f8f8; bcd84b5b9346d8ea7fba57c5be58f4f9c239f570; d403a2dd3dde2ea2e5df7b52c1bd1df9da2a3ab7; 8beb43098899a3a3bc489fc13336f63ea8cd4371; b6321e3a1734c1d18f78419ea30bff7f32fd5523; 04d62b683d0581dc4de27e2e29f727d1451042fa,International Journal of Genomics,2016,
899a59bb569a0619e2fa1a7be53dd27dafe8fca5,A joint study of whole exome sequencing and structural MRI analysis in major depressive disorder.,"BACKGROUND
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Genetic studies of MDD have focused on common variants and have been constrained by the heterogeneity of clinical symptoms.


METHODS
We sequenced the exome of 77 cases and 245 controls of Han Chinese ancestry and scanned their brain. Burden tests of rare variants were performed first to explore the association between genes/pathways and MDD. Secondly, parallel Independent Component Analysis was conducted to investigate genetic underpinnings of gray matter volume (GMV) changes of MDD.


RESULTS
Two genes (CSMD1, p = 5.32Ã—10-6; CNTNAP5, p = 1.32Ã—10-6) and one pathway (Neuroactive Ligand Receptor Interactive, p = 1.29Ã—10-5) achieved significance in burden test. In addition, we identified one pair of imaging-genetic components of significant correlation (r = 0.38, p = 9.92Ã—10-6). The imaging component reflected decreased GMV in cases and correlated with intelligence quotient (IQ). IQ mediated the effects of GMV on MDD. The genetic component enriched in two gene sets, namely Singling by G-protein coupled receptors [false discovery rate (FDR) q = 3.23Ã—10-4) and Alzheimer Disease Up (FDR q = 6.12Ã—10-4).


CONCLUSIONS
Both rare variants analysis and imaging-genetic analysis found evidence corresponding with the neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity hypotheses of MDD. The mediation of IQ indicates that genetic component may act on MDD through GMV alteration and cognitive impairment.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yamin Zhang"", ids = ""2412431""); list(name = ""Ming-li Li"", ids = ""47057939""); list(name = ""Qiang Wang"", ids = ""37601186""); list(name = ""Jacob Shujui Hsu"", ids = ""21225558""); list(name = ""Wei Deng"", ids = ""1726776""); list(name = ""Xiaohong Ma"", ids = ""47066032""); list(name = ""Peiyan Ni"", ids = ""50508986""); list(name = ""Liansheng Zhao"", ids = ""7900635""); list(name = ""Yang Tian"", ids = ""38418995""); list(name = ""Pak Chung Sham"", ids = ""2613549""); list(name = ""Tao Li"", ids = ""144131891"")",,,Psychological medicine,,"

2315e0dfc4d53398ae841c8f29e5e4145309867a,A meta-analysis of candidate gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke in 6 study populations: association of lymphotoxin-alpha in nonhypertensive patients.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Ischemic stroke is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic component. Pathways, including lipid metabolism, systemic chronic inflammation, coagulation, blood pressure regulation, and cellular adhesion, have been implicated in stroke pathophysiology, and candidate gene polymorphisms in these pathways have been proposed as genetic risk factors.


METHODS
We genotyped 105 simple deletions and single nucleotide polymorphisms from 64 candidate genes in 3550 patients and 6560 control subjects from 6 case-control association studies conducted in the United States, Europe, and China. Genotyping was performed using the same immobilized probe typing system and meta-analyses were based on summary logistic regressions for each study. The primary analyses were fixed-effects meta-analyses adjusting for age and sex with additive, dominant, and recessive models of inheritance.


RESULTS
Although 7 polymorphisms showed a nominal additive association, none remained statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. In contrast, after stratification for hypertension, 2 lymphotoxin-alpha polymorphisms, which are in strong linkage disequilibrium, were significantly associated among nonhypertensive individuals: LTA 252A>G (additive model; OR, 1.41 with 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.65; P=0.00002) and LTA 26Thr>Asn (OR, 1.19 with 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.34; P=0.003). LTA 252A>G remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing using either the false discovery rate or by permutation testing. The 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms showed no association in hypertensive subjects (eg, LTA 252A>G, OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.03; P=0.17).

bb3798f22ed438c92823aa026a5374cdb429182c,Expanded methyl-sensitive cut counting reveals hypomethylation as an epigenetic state that highlights functional sequences of the genome.,"Methyl-sensitive cut counting (MSCC) with the HpaII methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme is a cost-effective method to pinpoint unmethylated CpGs at single base-pair resolution. However, it has the drawback of addressing only CpGs in the context of the CCGG site, leaving out the remainder of the possible 16 XCGX tetranucleotides in which CpGs are found. We expanded MSCC to include three additional enzymes to address a total of 5 of the 16 XCGX combinations. This allowed us to survey methylation at about one-third of all a mammalian genome's CpGs. Applied to mouse liver DNA, we correctly confirmed data reported with other methods showing hypomethylation to be concentrated at promoters and in CpG islands (CGIs), with gene bodies and intergenic regions being mostly methylated. Grouping unmethylated CpGs, characterized by high MSCC scores (7% false discovery rate), we found a large number of unmethylated regions not qualifying as CGIs located in intergenic and intronic regions, which are highly enriched in functional DNA sequences (open regulatory annotation database) as well as in noncoding yet highly conserved mammalian sequences thought to be important but with as yet unknown function. About 50% of MSCC-defined unmethylated regions do not overlap algorithm-defined CGIs and offer a novel search space in which new functionalities of DNA may be found in health and disease.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Alejandro Colaneri"", ids = ""5275764""); list(name = ""Nickolas G.

78d5d15fcfa7f80b4ef5c037662cea2560c56dc9,Genetic variants of genes in the NER pathway associated with risk of breast cancer: A large-scale analysis of 14 published GWAS datasets in the DRIVE study.,"A recent hypothesis-free pathway-level analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets suggested that the overall genetic variation measured by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway genes was associated with breast cancer (BC) risk, but no detailed SNP information was provided. To substantiate this finding, we performed a larger meta-analysis of 14 previously published GWAS datasets in the Discovery, Biology and Risk of Inherited Variants in Breast Cancer (DRIVE) study with 53,107 subjects of European descent. Using a hypothesis-driven approach, we selected 138 candidate genes from the NER pathway using the ""Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB)"" and ""PathCards"". All SNPs were imputed using IMPUTE2 with the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3. Logistic regression was used to estimate BC risk, and pooled ORs for each SNP were obtained from the meta-analysis using the false discovery rate for multiple test correction. RegulomeDB, HaploReg, SNPinfo and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis were used to assess the SNP functionality. We identified four independent SNPs associated with BC risk, BIVM-ERCC5 rs1323697_C (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03-1.10), GTF2H4 rs1264308_T (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.89-0.97), COPS2 rs141308737_C deletion (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03-1.09) and ELL rs1469412_C (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.90-0.96). Their combined genetic score was also associated with BC risk (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.08-1.16, ptrend < 0.0001). The eQTL analysis revealed that BIVM-ERCC5 rs1323697 C and ELL rs1469412 C alleles were correlated with increased mRNA expression levels of their genes in 373 lymphoblastoid cell lines (p = 0.022 and 2.67â€‰Ã— 10-22 , respectively).

e3ee83416fd8985c426c86c76c82d7849579359d,ABO blood group and risk of cancer: A register-based cohort study of 1.6 million blood donors.,"INTRODUCTION
The associations between ABO blood group and cancer risk have been studied repeatedly, but results have been variable. Consistent associations have only been reported for pancreatic and gastric cancers.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We estimated associations between different ABO blood groups and site-specific cancer risk in a large cohort of healthy blood donors from Sweden and Denmark.


RESULTS
A total of 1.6 million donors were followed over 27 million person-years (20 million in Sweden and 7 million in Denmark). We observed 119,584 cancer cases. Blood groups A, AB and B were associated either with increased or decreased risk of cancer at 13 anatomical sites (pâ‰¤0.05), compared to blood group O. Consistent with assessment using a false discovery rate approach, significant associations with ABO blood group were observed for cancer of the pancreas, breast, and upper gastrointestinal tract (mouth, salivary glands, pharynx, esophageal adenocarcinoma and stomach).


DISCUSSION

18adcbf2b8c1b9799e984ead66b2c93cde465b40,Haplotype-based association of renin gene polymorphisms with essential hypertension in Han population of northern china,"Introduction: The renin gene has been suggested as a good candidate in the study of genetic mechanism of essential hypertension. However, studies on the contribution of renin gene polymorphisms to essential hypertension, have not had consistent outcomes. The purpose of the present study is to explore the association of renin gene polymorphisms with essential hypertension in the Han population of northern China. Methods: A case-control study was conducted among 3090 Han farmers (1533 essential hypertension patients and 1557 normotensives). Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and polymerase chain reaction-sequencing. Results: The genotypic and allelic distributions of rs2368564 in essential hypertension and control was significant statistically (p<0.001). The allelic distribution of rs10900557 showed marginal statistical significance (p=0.048). There were no significant differences in other genotypic and allelic distributions (p>0.05). In the haplotypes comprised by the six single-nucleotide polymorphisms, there were differences in the distribution of haplotypes A-T-C-G-C-A, A-T-C-G-C-G, G-C-T-G-T-A and G-C-T-G-T-G in both groups, and their differences reached to significant levels, respectively. After having corrected for false discovery rate, this association still remained significant. Conclusions: The current study provides evidence for a possible association of renin gene polymorphisms with essential hypertension in a Han population of northern China.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Guoping Zhang"", ids = ""47776564""); list(name = ""Xueyan Li"", ids = ""1989860""); list(name = ""Keyong Zhang"", ids = ""14838847""); list(name = ""Jingbo Zhao"", ids = ""3033020""); list(name = ""Changchun Qiu"", ids = ""3020693"")",,ebf2d5d6675c517297e77775662980eccb0a0e03; af547b6ee4e18a1afd1a24c56c0e32edda9d9dcb; 7bb0618bf05009a4a093faf1369298aad0379e48; 8bf8f5a1bf5a3eacd57b9b28043adcacc6ecb691; 4635f248f531c070d86bb5f2592e366ddea7762a; 451fa56b463fd5910de615d9119f7868f867e364; 619d8ff694e856110fce6493ffc57eaecf63aeb0; b29e0c7eee3e5b3ad2d82f767d96c3a198c9f6b2; dc791b8176fee4f218a960990c54946696d6f35d; abbdd7a278cebeb85d6f1f51e6c07dde3f1a2128; 4ce503ca53d8621ffd29adfd5645c8c96707f2ac; 1e24cb6f470a85b6cc81adf4b6a395b26223c6a6; 2ff0be54a89d76afbb3e2e666e954913c57c3815; 1cac07bb5ca2babeb8e9d2eb566049487fa1c960; 3aa88ab18dffb1690b36bea1bb7b09b3e3c1548a; 9b82c45f05d01ba05c9c8e1189951e5058bafdf2; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; dfbe90a58bdbca5c42d76076f94fde4c339c0155; 1953a5cf4b7460faa6995e9a8b6e50e11abbb27f; 4fa8414b2f695829d1db93f27488dba3d431abcf,Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System: JRAAS,18,

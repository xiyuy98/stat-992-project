0f497f9c73e1f9be758edfa3c62a4ca112af3bbe,Hemoglobin Levels and Red Blood Cells Distribution Width Highlights Glioblastoma Patients Subgroup With Improved Median Overall Survival,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is known for its dismal prognosis, though its dependence on patients' readily available RBCs parameters is not fully established. In this work, 170 GBM patients, diagnosed and treated in Soroka University Medical Center (SUMC) over the last 12 years were retrospectively inspected for their survival dependency on pre-operative RBCs parameters. Besides KPS and tumor resection supplemented by oncological treatment, age under 70 (HR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.24â€“0.65, p = 0.00073), low hemoglobin level (HR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.06â€“2.99, p = 0.031), and Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) < 14% (HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.37â€“0.88, p = 0.018) were found to be prognostic of patients' overall survival in multivariate analysis, accounting for a false discovery rate of < 5% due to multiple hypothesis testing. According to these results, a stratification tree was made, from which a favorable route highlighted a subgroup of nearly 30% of the cohorts' patients whose median overall survival was 21.1 months (95% CI 16.2â€“27.2)â€”higher than the established chemo-radiation standard first-line treatment regimen overall median survival average of about 15 months. The beneficial or detrimental effect of RBCs parameters on GBM prognosis and its possible causes is discussed.",2020,,"list(name = ""Tehila Kaisman-Elbaz"", ids = ""1404182516""); list(name = ""Yonatan Elbaz"", ids = ""10348149""); list(name = ""Vladimir Merkin"", ids = ""4122245""); list(name = ""Lianne Dym"", ids = ""1638267664""); list(name = ""Ariel Noy"", ids = ""34915317""); list(name = ""M Atar-Vardi"", ids = ""1413829985""); list(name = ""Romi Bari"", ids = ""32626141""); list(name = ""Sivan Turiel"", ids = ""1638150409""); list(name = ""Adi Alt"", ids = ""1638150439""); list(name = ""Tali Zamed"", ids = ""1638438480""); list(name = ""Yael Eskira"", ids = ""4210793""); list(name = ""Konstantin Lavrenkov"", ids = ""6363302""); list(name = ""Yarden Kezerle"", ids = ""1441587438""); list(name = ""Victor V.

ab991b004bd04f3203fe8b1cc772267c05dccf52,A Genome Scan for Selection Signatures in Pigs,"Identifying signatures of selection can provide a straightforward insight into the mechanism of artificial selection and further uncover the causal genes related to the phenotypic variation. Based on Illumina Porcine60KSNP chip data, four complementary methods, Long-Range Haplotype (LRH), Tajima's D, Cross Population Extend Haplotype Homozygosity Test (XPEHH) and FST, were implemented in this study to detect the selection signatures in the whole genome of one typical Chinese indigenous breed, Rongchang, one Chinese cultivated breed, Songliao, and two western breeds, Landrace and Yorkshire. False Discovery Rate (FDR) was implemented to control the false positive rates. In our study, a total of 159, 127, 179 and 159 candidate selection regions with average length of 0.80 Mb, 0.73 Mb, 0.78 Mb and 0.73 Mb were identified in Landrace, Rongchang, Songliao and Yorkshire, respectively, that span approximately 128.00 Mb, 92.38 Mb, 130.30 Mb and 115.40 Mb and account for approximately 3.74-5.33% of genome across all autosomes. The selection regions of 11.52 Mb shared by Landrace and Yorkshire were the longest when chosen pairs from the pool of the four breeds were examined. The overlaps between Yorkshire and Songliao, approximately 9.20 Mb, were greater than those of Yorkshire and Rongchang. Meanwhile, the overlaps between Landrace and Songliao were greater than those of Landrace and Rongchang but less than those of Songliao and Ronchang. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the genes/QTLs relevant to fertility, coat color, and ear morphology were found in candidate selection regions. Some genes, such as LEMD3, MC1R, KIT, TRHR etc. that were reported under selection, were confirmed in our study, and this analysis also demonstrated the diversity of breeds.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yunlong Ma"", ids = ""145151716""); list(name = ""Julong Wei"", ids = ""4844595""); list(name = ""Qin Zhang"", ids = ""49347231""); list(name = ""Lei Chen"", ids = ""47818720""); list(name = ""Jinyong Wang"", ids = ""2564742""); list(name = ""Jianfeng Liu"", ids = ""37861648""); list(name = ""Xiangdong Ding"", ids = ""145592947"")",b4cb78e0a0ac8c1d3bbe32c43c6bc119154dbf03; 99dc6a53e379086b38ec2695f8ff4825ac0516b8; 5a21ab3cc33ce0344119a985af2b2ac8c8eea40d; a5a8691366ffb75dd47798c5eecbb59c68662350; b5b9d2a7883909a55dc4baa889933c0870e78fef; ed4fcf4a21bbc85cf5db3138e6003ed398228d4b; 38de57211b3ef354a59017dfe77c8667b5dcb299; 4d0f858af277fa25a56fa27b45ce9ba268d3792d; 53e847c65e6117eab10a3c3d61f66969b310b5a4; 1528c3893210da7c6f5d9e126468831ce479385c,ca202ec80dadc11ac6b1dab866eb9a7c7826cc19; 01790bfb7f17a3fc1980af1cda8498190c95d383; 654be56a9db6f38531555ebd87dbbc8089451605; 91c7b5eaf88191f47a7fe63fdf74a7b82d1f3dd5; 93825abdd333cea7105201c068c6e6b50f6028d7; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; 5613d87892dead35ffd414126a1ec6e32137ec22; a5b3a38028959c23be2f0acdc60d3e2762b88596; 507ea84199e2f47e3e6e98133eb028749937fd3e; 11f5cc68434c71c768fadeaedee68ea9382ad2ef; 5ee5e4ad12edf6226fe22161a7a14c699caadc1f; 30b337e12c76944a60540ed6f757259261e69aa7; ed4ca42eaed34e993833223ed7341adbdc0ef22b; d62c2a5c6650c9b03c04accb21fa3b2c1a789e79; 6973c865e45ccc07b4b1ecdb3b641d6cd17bd4cd; 61cf767823318c6313816be202b42527ccab6929; 74f662f459e262eca34c7ffa5a293ba614f44849; 89e8793e96cd40f88383dc49320b478a0698b07c; 1f57ebc046c0f2b300ccd109219b172029d431b7; 1f6bd59a3c751c73ad61427e8dafe4f291bec72d; 2d265baac2b80d3d31f246a407dff90c1046d74f; bcdd8e5fd012b25a41764cce7d60cb604460e282; f20e5306de1da7241784baa3e3fb563648a7f49c; 2c9a9c4c96b13938639a14304e300854b2457c1b; 014c619f1985a7903017703a7f69b3a8f4f28ed1; dd1b3a3793619cec8994cc7cca10e6dee656fb7b; c30442ddaaaa16fbd720538443332317c9374438; aa0380c28c7aa398babbc7bd8b15c0f11a80c564; 4f3d6ea25f65aef7f8353a0bd484a60a5dc760c6; 00b5a259a7246aeb66dd2edcd40e75f300a844bb; e5d4c18a76ec59c89e42aa3f88df118bed58da49; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c762dec6c6a352a19918fee83828a8a1b0148dae; 8d2d11e1543add49bc25876bb300b42e52597350; 768c4f6fe67b77b1ab6c9ac115a271aa26e936d1; 4c6c3c6768099a55eb7892399a10ed195f8210b6; ead5bbbfc12b6501646cabc08b187e318e3c78de; 9e9038197adecd985f883ad49a16ca8c6332aca0; a060494fdb687f13c644dfc2b5bc1468b2bacc21; 36d0fafd4a2502bcd68b14c2e47c9700fdec6622; c42c1891cd7e0283f7c5f061e50bb85c7dc2aa6e; 5d6637132a0108501085b4ce37ea2f9816ddf419; c8d3af7a05a09e1d27297a70400b314543bcbd44; 361cc0adf6a6c481feb6782a6fbb9bd0bfc393dc; 54d6e1190daa67c848c289be7bee2b4b06034fa8,PLoS ONE,10,
66aaed4c301e13a8297397994ca9b46fc57e9526,Abstract 18338: Genomics-metabolomics Integrative Approach Reveals Novel Biomarkers In DPYS Associated With Higher Glucose Change After Treatment With Atenolol,"Introduction: Î²-blockers, including atenolol, are among the most widely prescribed antihypertensive drug classes. However, their use has been associated with hyperglycemia and incident diabetes, which poses concern for prescribers and patients. The Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses (PEAR) study is a multicenter clinical trial with one of its objectives to identify genetic influences on adverse metabolic events in patients treated with atenolol. Here we report a genomics-metabolomics integrative approach to identify biomarkers associated with atenolol-induced glucose change. Methods: PEAR participants were genotyped using the Illumina Omni 1M-Quad Chip. Metabolite profiles were acquired through GC-TOF-MS. Association between baseline levels of metabolites and glucose change was conducted using a multivariate linear regression model adjusted for age, gender and baseline fasting glucose. Genomics-metabolomics integration included selecting SNPs within genes involved in the synthesis and degradation of top metabolites and testing their effect on glucose change in 234 atenolol-treated Caucasians in PEAR, adjusting for age, gender, baseline glucose and principal components 1 and 2. A false discovery rate (FDR) of .05 was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Replication of significant SNPs was conducted in an additional 228 participants treated with atenolol in PEAR. Results: Metabolomics analysis revealed 3 metabolites associated with glucose change that passed FDR adjustment. The top metabolite signal was beta-alanine. Increasing levels of baseline beta-alanine was significantly correlated with greater glucose increases after atenolol treatment (p=.0003). A total of 79 SNPs in 12 genes in the beta-alanine pathway were explored. SNP rs2669429 in DPYS was significantly associated with glucose change, after FDR adjustment. We found that G allele carriers had significantly greater glucose change compared with non-carriers (p=.0006; Î²=+2.76 mg/dL). This finding was successfully replicated in the other 228 patients who received atenolol (p=.04; Î²=+1.86 mg/dL). Conclusions: These results suggest that beta alanine and DPYS rs2669429 SNP might be an important predictor of atenolol-induced dysglycemia.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Felipe Antunes de Oliveira"", ids = ""145509972""); list(name = ""Mohamed Hossam A.

6f459de328b9bcf9bee2e6732cc8f522c3e008e4,Aberrantly expressed mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs in patients with invasive ductal breast carcinoma: A pilot study,"Invasive ductal breast carcinoma (IDBC) is the most prevalent type of invasive breast cancer in females; however, the pathogenesis of IDBC remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the identification of novel markers may enhance current understanding of the initiation and development of IDBC as well as elucidate potential therapeutic targets for effective treatment of IDBC. In the present study, a pilot study was conducted to screen for potential mRNAs and long nonâ€‘coding (lnc)RNAs that exhibit aberrantly altered expression in patients with IDBC. Fresh breast cancer specimens and normal breast tissues were obtained from three female patients with IDBC aged â‰¥60 years following a modified radical mastectomy without chemotherapy. Expression levels of 44,244 probes were detected and included in the analysis, of which 22,078 (49.9%) were mRNAs and 22,166 (50.1%) were lncRNAs. Potential marker screening was performed using paired tâ€‘tests (criterion 1), false discovery rates (FDR; criterion 2) and sure independence screening procedures based on distance correlations (DCâ€‘SIS; criterion 3). The results showed that in IDBC tissues 3,510 probes had a â‰¥2â€‘fold statistically significant change in expression levels compared to those in the corresponding normal breast tissue (P<0.05); in addition, following FDR analysis, 353 probes were found to have significantly altered expression levels. Furthermore, DCâ€‘SIS analysis identified 18 probes (12 mRNA and 6 lncRNAs) with significantly altered expression levels in IDBC tissue; these 18 probes therefore demonstrated significant results in all three criteria.

8c9814649938d35c64b8d0564f0c6b3b0b75672f,The Influence of Stroke Location on Cognitive and Mood Impairment. A Voxel-Based Lesion-Symptom Mapping Study.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
The role of stroke location as a determinant of mood and cognitive symptoms is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to identify the predictive value of ischemic stroke location, on a voxel basis, for mood and cognitive outcome.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A prospective monocentric study including patients with a supratentorial ischemic stroke was conducted. A 3 Tesla brain MRI was performed at baseline. Mood and cognition were assessed using Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD), apathy inventory (AI), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale subscores, performed at 3 months poststroke. Statistical maps of ischemic stroke location associated with 3 months mood and cognitive scores were obtained using a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping approach (Brunner and Munzel test). Significant voxels (false discovery rate [FDR] corrected-P < .01) were identified using the standard Montreal Neurological Institute-152 space template.


RESULTS
Two hundred and sixty-five nonsevere stroke patients were included (64% men, mean age 66 Â± 14, median National Institute of Health Stroke Score 3, interquartile range 2-6). Ischemic stroke location was not associated with HAD or AI scores. Language, abstraction, and delayed recall performances were mainly associated with left-side hemispheric lesions. Lesions in both hemispheres were associated with lower performances in visuospatial and executive functions, naming, attention, and orientation.


CONCLUSION
Ischemic stroke location does not predict mood outcome at 3 months but is a determinant of cognitive outcome in specific domains.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sharmila Sagnier"", ids = ""6278947""); list(name = ""Fanny Munsch"", ids = ""4072352""); list(name = ""Antoine Bigourdan"", ids = ""4389920""); list(name = ""Sabrina Debruxelles"", ids = ""4265128""); list(name = ""Mathilde Poli"", ids = ""39710052""); list(name = ""Pauline Renou"", ids = ""33949621""); list(name = ""Stephane Olindo"", ids = ""3740731""); list(name = ""F RodrÃ­guez Rouanet"", ids = ""5473568""); list(name = ""Vincent Dousset"", ids = ""3351983""); list(name = ""Thomas Tourdias"", ids = ""2390612""); list(name = ""Igor Sibon"", ids = ""4559851"")",,,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,28 5,"

ecdfdd8a6cc9a80430e0541f30832c1099e82c15,Gaining power in multiple testing of interval hypotheses via conditionalization.,"In this article, we introduce a novel procedure for improving power of multiple testing procedures (MTPs) of interval hypotheses. When testing interval hypotheses the null hypothesis $P$-values tend to be stochastically larger than standard uniform if the true parameter is in the interior of the null hypothesis. The new procedure starts with a set of $P$-values and discards those with values above a certain pre-selected threshold, while the rest are corrected (scaled-up) by the value of the threshold. Subsequently, a chosen family-wise error rate (FWER) or false discovery rate MTP is applied to the set of corrected $P$-values only. We prove the general validity of this procedure under independence of $P$-values, and for the special case of the Bonferroni method, we formulate several sufficient conditions for the control of the FWER. It is demonstrated that this ""filtering"" of $P$-values can yield considerable gains of power.",2018,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jules L.

1bb970cd2e4b7661e82ae41fe41fb971b00f8e00,MicroRNA-98 is a prognostic factor for asbestos-induced mesothelioma.,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a type of cancer characterized by a short survival time and poor prognosis. Malignant pleural mesothelioma is most frequently associated with exposure to asbestos and other elongated mineral fibers. The aim of this study was to examine molecular differences between asbestos-exposedÂ and non-exposedÂ MPM patients and assess prognostic significances of molecular factors. Clinical and genetic data were downloaded from Cancer Genome Atlas. To identify the molecular differences, Significant Analysis of Microarray method was used. Prognostic significances of differentially expressed genes were confirmed by using Kaplan-Meier curve with the Log-Rank test. Although mRNAs did not exhibit any significant differences between the two patient groups, nine miRNAs were found to be down-regulated in the asbestos-exposed group. The top five pathways most relevant to the selected miRNAs were extracted through pathway enrichment analysis. Survival analysis revealed that high expression of only hsa-miR-98 was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with asbestos-exposed MPM. Evidence suggests that management of the aggressiveness and progression of asbestos-induced MPM may require high levels of hsa-miR-98 due to its tumor-suppressive role. This study might be helpful in enhancing our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying asbestos-induced MPM and for acquiring greater insights into targeted therapy.Abbreviations: FDR: false discovery rate; MM: malignant mesothelioma; MPM: malignant pleural mesothelioma; mRNA: messenger RNA; miRNA: microRNA; SAM: significance analysis of microarrays; TCGA: the cancer genome atlas.",2020,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kyubo Kim"", ids = ""51111042""); list(name = ""Yeji Ko"", ids = ""1516799032""); list(name = ""Hyeon-Cheol Oh"", ids = ""13061245""); list(name = ""Mihyang Ha"", ids = ""51267304""); list(name = ""Junho Kang"", ids = ""3122147""); list(name = ""Eun Jung Kwon"", ids = ""50094194""); list(name = ""Ji Wan Kang"", ids = ""1515335651""); list(name = ""Youngjoo Kim"", ids = ""47659005""); list(name = ""Hye Jin Heo"", ids = ""40424016""); list(name = ""Guanghwi Kim"", ids = ""1516849296""); list(name = ""Jung Kim"", ids = ""5727402""); list(name = ""Yun Seob Kim"", ids = ""81539573"")",,,Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

58b39ce9ed626cd9cae81ee954c2f0c87817467f,Joint Association of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Variants with Abdominal Obesity in American Indians: The Strong Heart Family Study,"Cigarette smoke is a strong risk factor for obesity and cardiovascular disease. The effect of genetic variants involved in nicotine metabolism on obesity or body composition has not been well studied. Though many genetic variants have previously been associated with adiposity or body fat distribution, a single variant usually confers a minimal individual risk. The goal of this study is to evaluate the joint association of multiple variants involved in cigarette smoke or nicotine dependence with obesity-related phenotypes in American Indians. To achieve this goal, we genotyped 61 tagSNPs in seven genes encoding nicotine acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in 3,665 American Indians participating in the Strong Heart Family Study. Single SNP association with obesity-related traits was tested using family-based association, adjusting for traditional risk factors including smoking. Joint association of all SNPs in the seven nAChRs genes were examined by gene-family analysis based on weighted truncated product method (TPM). Multiple testing was controlled by false discovery rate (FDR). Results demonstrate that multiple SNPs showed weak individual association with one or more measures of obesity, but none survived correction for multiple testing. However, gene-family analysis revealed significant associations with waist circumference (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0001) and waist-to-hip ratio (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0001), but not body mass index (pâ€Š=â€Š0.20) and percent body fat (pâ€Š=â€Š0.29), indicating that genetic variants are jointly associated with abdominal, but not general, obesity among American Indians. The observed combined genetic effect is independent of cigarette smoking per se. In conclusion, multiple variants in the nAChR gene family are jointly associated with abdominal obesity in American Indians, independent of general obesity and cigarette smoking per se.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yun Zhu"", ids = ""144057177""); list(name = ""Jingyun Yang"", ids = ""47988509""); list(name = ""Fawn Yeh"", ids = ""2996041""); list(name = ""S.

f52710d6e72f22d08675d77a3e93ea4ffd713c8c,Abstract P6-05-02: Identification of microRNAs differentially expressed in brain metastasis secondary to breast cancer,"Background: Despite sequential improvements in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer (BC), recurrence and metastasis remains a major clinical problem and in particular, brain metastasis (BCBM). A number of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been linked to the metastatic process in BC, but to date there is limited work on the microRNAs involved in BCBM. The current study aim to identify differentially expressed miRNAs within primary breast cancer who did not recur (BCNR) versus primary BC cases which did recur (BCR) and their matched BCBM cases. Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material was collected of 12 primary BCNRs from the Liverpool tissue bank and of 40 paired primary BCR samples and their matched BCBM from the Walton Research Tissue Bank and RCSI National Breast Cancer Bioresource. miRNA was extracted (Qiagen miRNeasy FFPE kit) and profiled using the NanoStringâ„¢ nCounterâ„¢ miRNA Expression Assay (Human v3 miRNA). The differentially expressed miRNAs between BCNR versus BCR and BCR versus their matched BCBM were identified by significance of microarray analysis (SAM) on the MeV4.9 software. Pathway analysis was performed using the DIANA-mirPath v3.0 software and the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to identify a network of genes/pathways regulated by the differentially expressed miRNAs. Results: 12 BCNR and 30 matched pairs of BCR and BCBM passed the quality control and normalisation processes. Principal component analysis (PCA) performed on 166 miRNAs after QC/normalisation clearly distinguishes the BCNR and the primary BCR from the matched BCBM cases, whereas SAM revealed 58 differentially expressed miRNAs with a 10% FDR (false discovery rate) and an absolute log2 fold-change (FC) >1 between BCNR and BCR and 11 between the matched BCs and BCBMs. Pathway clustering revealed that these differentially expressed miRNAs (10% FDR, log2FC>1) within both BCNR vs BCR and BCR vs BCBM cohorts are highly enriched for genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interactions, proteoglycans, adherens junctions, TGF-Î², p53 and Hippo signalling. IPA identified a network of genes, implicated in the processes of breast cancer invasion and metastasis, regulated by the identified miRNAs, such as, TWIST, MET, TP53, MYC, EZH2, ZEB1, TAGLN and BIRC5. Four of the significantly differentially expressed miRNAs, hsa-miR-132-3p, hsa-miR-199a-5p, hsa-miR-150-5p and hsa-miR-155-5p were present within both cohorts (BCNR vs BCR and BCR vs BCBM) and regulate genes involved in Hippo and TGF-Î² signalling (DIANA-mirPath v3.0 analysis: p=5.23x10-08 and p=2.67x10-07 respectively). Conclusion: The current study, utilising a large cohort of paired BCR and BCBM cases, provides novel insight into the molecular mechanisms and role of miRNAs in BCBM. Four miRNAs (hsa-miR-132-3p, hsa-miR-199a-5p, hsa-miR-150-5p and hsa-miR-155-5p) in particular could be potentially used to identify patients with increased risk of developing brain metastasis and help facilitate the development of specific treatments for BCBM, which to date have proved elusive. The miRNAs identified require further exploration as potential biomarkers as well as novel therapeutic targets.

0679d4b6248c21368db0ec0b71088c8cb5fefefe,Identification of nine novel loci related to hematological traits in a Japanese population,"Recent genome-wide association studies have identified various genetic variants associated with hematological traits. Although it is possible that quantitative data of hematological traits are varied among the years examined, conventional genome-wide association studies have been conducted in a cross-sectional manner that measures traits at a single point in time. To address this issue, we have traced blood profiles in 4,884 Japanese individuals who underwent annual health check-ups for several years. In the present study, longitudinal exome-wide association studies were conducted to identify genetic variants related to 13 hematological phenotypes. The generalized estimating equation model showed that a total of 67 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were significantly [false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.01] associated with hematological phenotypes. Of the 67 SNPs, nine SNPs were identified as novel hematological markers: rs4686683 of SENP2 for red blood cell count (FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.008, P = 5.5 Ã— 10-6); rs3917688 of SELP for mean corpuscular volume (FDR = 0.005, P = 2.4 Ã— 10-6); rs3133745 of C8orf37-AS1 for white blood cell count (FDR = 0.003, P = 1.3 Ã— 10-6); rs13121954 at 4q31.2 for basophil count (FDR = 0.007, P = 3.1 Ã— 10-5); rs7584099 at 2q22.3 (FDR = 2.6 Ã— 10-5, P = 8.8 Ã— 10-8), rs1579219 of HCG17 (FDR = 0.003, P = 2.0 Ã— 10-5), and rs10757049 of DENND4C (FDR = 0.008, P = 5.6 Ã— 10-5) for eosinophil count; rs12338 of CTSB for neutrophil count (FDR = 0.007, P = 2.9 Ã— 10-5); and rs395967 of OSMR-AS1 for monocyte count (FDR = 0.008, P = 3.2 Ã— 10-5).",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yoshiki Yasukochi"", ids = ""8544496""); list(name = ""Jun Sakuma"", ids = ""46764062""); list(name = ""Ichiro Takeuchi"", ids = ""3046458""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Mitsutoshi Oguri"", ids = ""5005355""); list(name = ""Tetsuo Fujimaki"", ids = ""49996701""); list(name = ""Hideki Horibe"", ids = ""3512685""); list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""51026510"")",dc6f042fbb348945bf9f7d716c5dc1c0cad89a3a; 740896698975351c52d47a7083a7b880b6ece2e1,,Physiological Genomics,50,758 - 769

Methods: DNA methylation (DNAm) of participants from multigenerational databases (Bergen centre ECRHS/RHINESSA n=98/95) was quantified in whole blood using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Robust multivariate linear model was used with offspring DNAm as outcome and paternal smoking as exposure, including relevant covariates (offspring/maternal smoking) and cell type proportion. ToppGene and topKEGG was used for pathway analysis. Results: Ever-smoking prevalence was 54% in offspring (mean age 31.3 years) and 42.1% in fathers. At False Discovery Rate (FDR) Conclusion: FathersÂ´smoking was associated with differential methylation in their children, in particular located to genes involved in Tobacco Use Disorder and ADHD, suggesting an epigenetic contribution and a paternal role in addiction susceptibility and behavioral dysfuntion.

965bcced82fc1d924152c29c1195908de572cb57,Bayesian Methods for Multiple Change-Point Detection with Reduced Communication,"In many modern applications, large-scale sensor networks are used to perform statistical inference tasks. In this paper, we propose Bayesian methods for multiple change-point detection using a sensor network in which a fusion center (FC) can receive a data stream from each sensor. Due to communication limitations, the FC monitors only a subset of the sensors at each time slot. Since the number of change points can be high, we adopt the false discovery rate (FDR) criterion for controlling the rate of false alarms, while minimizing the average detection delay (ADD). We propose two Bayesian detection procedures that handle the communication limitations by monitoring the subset of the sensors with the highest posterior probabilities of change points having occurred. This monitoring policy aims to minimize the delay between the occurrence of each change point and its declaration using the corresponding posterior probabilities. One of the proposed procedures is more conservative than the second one in terms of having lower FDR at the expense of higher ADD. It is analytically shown that both procedures control the FDR under a specified tolerated level and are also scalable in the sense that they attain an ADD that does not increase asymptotically with the number of sensors. In addition, it is demonstrated that the proposed detection procedures are useful for trading off between reduced ADD and reduced average number of observations drawn until discovery. Numerical simulations are conducted for validating the analytical results and for demonstrating the properties of the proposed procedures.",2020,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Eyal Nitzan"", ids = ""144469677""); list(name = ""Topi Halme"", ids = ""46200267""); list(name = ""Visa Koivunen"", ids = ""1731624"")",,b87fca1f7c41b791f5925b04a679c56f87289eef; 72d999b37470ca58c0e7b025060e32257f667e51; 8a3d8d68e70e5fc9ba67e884aaa243e4fd425bde; bad5edaf45a55e64491aaddb8238d1da38d36f80; 664d8d05369bfe665b5867b57b938d8f818f57fc; 03fd67e5a0f741aa19d474c18b9fed71d6e67c7d; d2ba3c3e96ef71a0485e620c275a1d393a49f8cf; 2def5ea8b905c5742e989279f14bab82e560a07e; abe66acf41edfe54bf26219b6e9eb0df5150ece8; 116390185ea443ef6aba99aded638cfe9fa14159; 44d86f3ba9167f4931dae729d814c13fbc7a0efb; 5a69ae6594e17b3e0087a720b06bb729fbe0ae5e; a93ff2c2d7ef562bebd359c2cb8c558caa39a267; c330004361bb25aeee6fce16c82e4dec98a9f738; ef4907244079876c6737eb6afcd92c846c7b9e69; f8b5bd3f0ded71e64e73d10a7f017550f6d93177; c4ee9cfd0794d9b85489846c5583102bde6ef723; 2073e1c897a6067c662f6889b815427555e1395c; a15285dd0df7b883ada2774c69a108cad54e352c; d22d6772d7b74ab78350051dd6342a8b4e95e201; ae3c60cf4066589d91256d52c6f568665f70568e; 05dbbfdf498f06d252c5958c4f11d519fb497800; e790ebe6f140c07a51a48da44345a43912bf6dc5; 2c8ae3d243b001f75e6ac94cebbe4bc7b2b6bed2; 3aa7770a2e6f371ac6abe4fa0c7bba65103f9dc3; b469b7253ed95354e44b56f5e4b9d83f9c7ca7f6; bcf79e65e7703a7da223e595ccd151bb1051d643; 386fae612a1b6aed53e90a07fad6c2ed80478f13; 613e1ad9490415af0b3bcfb44b640bced9da2de1; 8d9f581be529c46e6cbca7f3b08e49618502f70a; 3cf0ae41c9be3bd615ef2b7156132ff104daa803; cb0944d340c7a3580a7e446139d5e2a9c748f929; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 377797f2f838cef001eadb34b25eb576d4f3ac61; 43b253777599e07b1985947b8523b78527fd4837; 970df5b6189d2c084fa7b63d8f1f534044fdffe1,ArXiv,abs/2003.11062,

To identify novel loci, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) including 133,384 breast cancer cases and 113,789 controls, plus 18,908 BRCA1 mutation carriers (9,414 with breast cancer) of European ancestry, using both standard and novel methodologies that account for underlying tumor heterogeneity by estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status and tumor grade. We identified 32 novel susceptibility loci (P<5.0Ã—10-8), 15 of which showed evidence for associations with at least one tumor feature (false discovery rate <0.05). Five loci showed associations (P<0.05) in opposite directions between luminal- and non-luminal subtypes. In-silico analyses showed these five loci contained cell-specific enhancers that differed between normal luminal and basal mammary cells. The genetic correlations between five intrinsic-like subtypes ranged from 0.35 to 0.80. The proportion of genome-wide chip heritability explained by all known susceptibility loci was 37.6% for triple-negative and 54.2% for luminal A-like disease. These findings provide an improved understanding of genetic predisposition to breast cancer subtypes and will inform the development of subtype-specific polygenic risk scores.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Haoyu Zhang"", ids = ""49724454""); list(name = ""Thomas U.

70baf0766b23e6147da153d731d0db06e3ca1151,Loci Contributing to Boric Acid Toxicity in Two Reference Populations of Drosophila melanogaster,"Populations maintain considerable segregating variation in the response to toxic, xenobiotic compounds. To identify variants associated with resistance to boric acid, a commonly-used household insecticide with a poorly understood mechanism of action, we assayed thousands of individuals from hundreds of strains. Using the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR), a multi-parental population (MPP) of inbred genotypes, we mapped six QTL to short genomic regions containing few protein-coding genes (3-188), allowing us to identify plausible candidate genes underlying resistance to boric acid toxicity. One interval contains multiple genes from the cytochrome P450 family, and we show that ubiquitous RNAi of one of these genes, Cyp9b2, markedly reduces resistance to the toxin. Resistance to boric acid is positively correlated with caffeine resistance. The two phenotypes additionally share a pair of QTL, potentially suggesting a degree of pleiotropy in the genetic control of resistance to these two distinct xenobiotics. Finally, we screened the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) in an attempt to identify sequence variants within mapped QTL that are associated with boric acid resistance. The approach was largely unsuccessful, with only one QTL showing any associations at QTL-specific 20% False Discovery Rate (FDR) thresholds. Nonetheless, these associations point to a potential candidate gene that can be targeted in future validation efforts. Although the mapping data resulting from the two reference populations do not clearly overlap, our work provides a starting point for further genetic dissection of the processes underlying boric acid toxicity in insects.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael A.

9461a1f27dcec2f3b949cccc97062adb6b057656,Evaluation of the serum metabolome of patients with alkaptonuria before and after two years of treatment with nitisinone using LCâ€QTOFâ€MS,"Background
The homogentisic acid-lowering therapy nitisinone is being evaluated for the treatment of alkaptonuria (AKU) at the National Centre for AKU. Beyond hypertyrosinemia, the wider metabolic consequences of its use are largely unknown. The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of nitisinone on the serum metabolome of patients with AKU after 12 and 24â€‰months of treatment.


Methods
Deproteinized serum from 25 patients with AKU (mean age[Â±SD] 51.1 Â±â€‰14.9â€‰years, 12 male) was analyzed using the 1290 Infinity II liquid chromatography system coupled to a 6550 quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Agilent, UK). Raw data were processed using a batch targeted feature extraction algorithm and an accurate mass retention time database containing 469 intermediary metabolites (MW 72-785). Matched entities (Â±10 ppm theoretical accurate mass and Â±0.3â€‰minutes retention time window) were filtered based on their frequency and variability (<25% CV) in group quality control samples, and repeated measures statistical significance analysis with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate adjustment was used to assess changes in metabolite abundance.


Results
Eight metabolites increased in abundance (log2 fold change [FC] 2.1-15.2, P <â€‰.05); 7 of 8 entities were related to tyrosine metabolism, and 13 decreased in abundance (log2 FC 1.5-15.5, P <â€‰.05); including entities related to tyrosine (n = 2), tryptophan (n = 3), xanthine (n = 2), and citric acid cycle metabolism (n = 2).


Conclusions
Evaluation of the serum metabolome of patients with AKU showed a significant difference in the abundance of several metabolites following treatment with nitisinone, including a number that have not been previously reported; several of these were not related to the tyrosine metabolic pathway.

eb61bb3cf38dbe6e63f602b85764801166cc5258,Selenium and vitamin E: cell type- and intervention-specific tissue effects in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND
Secondary analyses of two randomized, controlled phase III trials demonstrated that selenium and vitamin E could reduce prostate cancer incidence. To characterize pharmacodynamic and gene expression effects associated with use of selenium and vitamin E, we undertook a randomized, placebo-controlled phase IIA study of prostate cancer patients before prostatectomy and created a preoperative model for prostatectomy tissue interrogation.


METHODS
Thirty-nine men with prostate cancer were randomly assigned to treatment with 200 microg of selenium, 400 IU of vitamin E, both, or placebo. Laser capture microdissection of prostatectomy biopsy specimens was used to isolate normal, stromal, and tumor cells. Gene expression in each cell type was studied with microarray analysis and validated with a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry. An analysis of variance model was fit to identify genes differentially expressed between treatments and cell types. A beta-uniform mixture model was used to analyze differential expression of genes and to assess the false discovery rate. All statistical tests were two-sided.


RESULTS
The highest numbers of differentially expressed genes by treatment were 1329 (63%) of 2109 genes in normal epithelial cells after selenium treatment, 1354 (66%) of 2051 genes in stromal cells after vitamin E treatment, and 329 (56%) of 587 genes in tumor cells after combination treatment (false discovery rate = 2%). Validation of 21 representative genes across all treatments and all cell types yielded Spearman correlation coefficients between the microarray analysis and the PCR validation ranging from 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.31 to 0.79) for the vitamin E group to 0.87 (95% CI = 0.53 to 0.99) for the selenium group. The increase in the mean percentage of p53-positive tumor cells in the selenium-treated group (26.3%), compared with that in the placebo-treated group (5%), showed borderline statistical significance (difference = 21.3%; 95% CI = 0.7 to 41.8; P = .051).


CONCLUSIONS
We have demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of the preoperative model and its power as a hypothesis-generating engine. We have also identified cell type- and zone-specific tissue effects of interventions with selenium and vitamin E that may have clinical implications.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dimitra Tsavachidou"", ids = ""2162988""); list(name = ""Timothy J.

An environment-wide association study (EWAS) may be useful to comprehensively test and validate associations between environmental factors and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in an unbiased manner.


METHODS
Data from cross-sectional cohorts from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2004) were randomly 50:50 split into training set and testing set. A value of ankle-brachial index (ABI) <1.0 or >1.4 defined PAD. We performed multiple linear regression analyses associating each of the 417 environmental and self-reported factors with PAD in the training set (false discovery rate <5%). Significant findings were validated in the testing set (p < 0.05) and entered into a logistic regression model with penalized likelihood based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).


RESULTS
Overall, 6819 participants >40 years old were included. The validated factors comprised positive associations with smoking-associated factors (cigarette smoker, family smoker and smoked >100 cigarettes, urinary cotinine), cadmium, urinary albumin, C-reactive protein, blood o-xylene and thyroxine 4, and inverse associations with Î±-carotene and trans-/cis-Î²-carotene for PAD. Finally, only 4 of these factors were nominally significant in the AIC-selected model: cadmium (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.12-1.45), cis-Î²-carotene (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72-0.91), CRP (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03-1.38) and urinary albumin (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04-1.38).


CONCLUSIONS
Our systematic evaluation provides new knowledge on the complex array of environmental correlates of PAD. These identified correlates need to be probed in further observational and interventional studies.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaodong Zhuang"", ids = ""144752211""); list(name = ""Ao Ni"", ids = ""40484277""); list(name = ""Lizhen Liao"", ids = ""14372447""); list(name = ""Yue Guo"", ids = ""143887169""); list(name = ""Wei Dai"", ids = ""143716168""); list(name = ""Yunxi Jiang"", ids = ""50262511""); list(name = ""Huimin Zhou"", ids = ""1994683""); list(name = ""Xun Hu"", ids = ""5840863""); list(name = ""Zhi-min Du"", ids = ""3696365""); list(name = ""Xueqin Wang"", ids = ""1977336""); list(name = ""Xinxue Liao"", ids = ""4081038"")",da4eecada274eda8687c948baeeb195f7bc1ac65; e0aac4d1cbd9e7a293298226091494b9d8933f26; 3687ee3f563536b59929f4a3b3eb51002e2a7f48; 25e6a0f6b9663ecdbc0e9b0813ddcec3058059e9; fbbfe526dd25962d16eb673b391d5fad08ab048b; 35d9e409fded747a20f85a8ce59dd107f05d7a56,,Atherosclerosis,269,"

Cancer-related cognitive dysfunction has mostly been attributed to chemotherapy; this explanation, however, fails to account for cognitive dysfunction observed in chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve patients. In a controlled, longitudinal, multisite study, we tested the hypothesis that cognitive function in breast cancer patients is affected by cancer-related post-traumatic stress.


Methods
Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and healthy control subjects, age 65 or younger, underwent three assessments within one year, including paper-and-pencil and computerized neuropsychological tests, clinical diagnostics of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and self-reported cognitive function. Analysis of variance was used to compare three groups of participants-patients who did or did not receive chemotherapy and healthy control subjects-on age- and education-corrected cognitive performance and cognitive change. Differences that were statistically significant after correction for false discovery rate were investigated with linear mixed-effects models and mediation models. All statistical tests were two-sided.


Results
Of 226 participants (166 patients and 60 control subjects), 206 completed all assessment sessions (attrition: 8.8%). Patients demonstrated overall cognitive decline (group*time effect on composite z -score: -0.13, P = .04) and scored consistently worse on Go/Nogo errors. The latter effect was mediated by PTSD symptoms (mediation effect: Bâ€‰=â€‰0.15, 95% confidence interval = 0.02 to 0.38). Only chemotherapy patients showed declined reaction time on a computerized alertness test. Overall cognitive performance correlated with self-reported cognitive problems at one year ( T = -0.11, P = .02).


Conclusions
Largely irrespective of chemotherapy, breast cancer patients may encounter very subtle cognitive dysfunction, part of which is mediated by cancer-related post-traumatic stress. Further factors other than treatment side effects remain to be investigated.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kerstin Hermelink"", ids = ""8218402""); list(name = ""Markus Buehner"", ids = ""48800799"");

a9420739e2533c4c2837516298b6ff3087a0ae78,A flexible two-stage procedure for identifying gene sets that are differentially expressed,"MOTIVATION
Microarray data analysis has expanded from testing individual genes for differential expression to testing gene sets for differential expression. The tests at the gene set level may focus on multivariate expression changes or on the differential expression of at least one gene in the gene set. These tests may be powerful at detecting subtle changes in expression, but findings at the gene set level need to be examined further to understand whether they are informative and if so how.


RESULTS
We propose to first test for differential expression at the gene set level but then proceed to test for differential expression of individual genes within discovered gene sets. We introduce the overall false discovery rate (OFDR) as an appropriate error rate to control when testing multiple gene sets and genes. We illustrate the advantage of this procedure over procedures that only test gene sets or individual genes.",2009,Computer Science; Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ruth Heller"", ids = ""144622349""); list(name = ""Elisabetta Manduchi"", ids = ""2389727""); list(name = ""Gregory R.

These changes have not been fully identified. This is the first Metabolome-Wide Association Study of the human plasma for the longitudinal change in memory in healthy adults. METHODS Ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry with liquid chromatography was performed on 207 University employeesâ€™ plasma. RESULTS From 10,201 measured metabolic features, 558 differed between those experiencing change vs no change in memory (False Discovery Rate, FDR< 0.2). Differentially abundant metabolites were observed in lipid and fatty acid metabolism pathways: glycerophospholipid (p=0.0003), fatty acid (p=0.0003) and linoleate (p=0.0003) pathways. Within these pathways, higher homocysteine (OR for memory decline=1.09, FDR=0.19) and lower arachidonic acid (OR=0.97, FDR=0.19), sterol (OR=0.92, FDR=0.02), acetylcholine (OR=0.78, FDR=0.19), carnitine (OR=0.75, FDR=0.19) and linoleic acid (OR=0.74, FDR=0.19) were associated memory decline.

749220e36e5dc43b08ad1915eff20e09dd6913a9,Increased susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis in Koreans heterozygous for HLA-DRB1*0405 and *0901.,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the association of susceptibility and protective HLA-DRB1 alleles with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its clinical markers in an Asian population.


METHODS
All RA patients (n = 574) and control subjects (n = 392) were Korean. HLA-DRB1 typing and further subtyping of all alleles was performed by polymerase chain reaction, sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization, and direct DNA sequencing analysis. We used a relative predispositional effects (RPEs) method and a false discovery rate correction method for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
The DRB1*0405 and *0901 alleles showed the most significant associations with RA (P = 7.83 x 10(-24), odds ratio [OR] 4.40 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 3.24-5.99], and P = 3.76 x 10(-9), OR 2.47 [95% CI 1.82-3.36], respectively). The RPEs test showed that the DRB1*0401 and *0410 alleles conferred susceptibility and that the DRB1*0701, *0802, *1301, *1302, *1403, and *1405 alleles showed significant protective effects. Susceptibility and protective alleles both showed a pattern consistent with additive genetic effects, and each influenced RA independently of the other. The compound heterozygote DRB1*0405/*0901 was associated with the highest risk of RA (corrected P = 1.81 x 10(-11), OR 58.2 [95% CI 7.95-425.70]). The mean age at disease onset was approximately 4 years earlier or was 3 years earlier, respectively, in patients with at least 1 copy of the DRB1*0405 or the DRB1*0901 allele. Radiographic changes (stages II-IV) were more frequent in patients with at least 1 copy of DRB1*0405 (P = 0.032, 92.6% versus 84.3%, OR 2.33 [95% CI 1.24-4.39]).

f43cae5096ab1f5720f849946646c8647c768414,Evaluation of differentially expressed genes by shear stress in human osteoarthritic chondrocytes in vitro.,"BACKGROUND
The pathogenesis of osteoarthritis is related to abnormal mechanical stresses that alter cartilage metabolism and chondrocyte survival. Among the mechanical stresses, shear stress is held responsible for the development of arthritis.


METHODS
Monolayer cultures of human osteoarthritic chondrocytes were subjected to fluid-induced shear stress in vitro. A cDNA microarray technology was used to screen the differentially regulated genes and quantitative real-time poly-merase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) was used to confirm the results. The significance of the expression ratio for each gene was determined on the lowest associated false discovery rate calculated from the changes of gene expression in relation to the standard deviation of repeated measurements for that gene.


RESULTS
Exposure of human osteoarthritic chondrocytes to shear stress (0.82 Pa) for 2 hours differentially regulated 373 and 227 clones in two independent microarray analyses with at least a 1.7-fold change. By comparing the differentially regulated clones, 14 upregulated and 6 downregulated genes were identified. Many of the differentially expressed genes were related to cell proliferation/differentiation (TGF-beta, acidic FGF), cell survival/apoptosis (CYP1B1, BCL2L3, TNFRSF11B, chemokine ligands, ADM), and matrix homeostasis (DCN, SDC2, MGP, WISP2).


CONCLUSION
The gene expression patterns following shear stress show a high similarity to the gene expression in the reparative process of osteoarthritis chondrocytes. Using microarray analysis, this study suggests a close interaction between shear stress and the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mel S Lee"", ids = ""6250409""); list(name = ""Ming-Tsung Sun"", ids = ""1880857""); list(name = ""See-Tong Pang"", ids = ""144364894""); list(name = ""Steve W.

2e141a30d87439989da6b839c2db85777b99cc6a,Nonparametric estimation of the density of the alternative hypothesis in a multiple testing setup. Application to local false discovery rate estimation,"In a multiple testing context, we consider a semiparametric mixture model with two components where one component is known and corresponds to the distribution of $p$-values under the null hypothesis and the other component $f$ is nonparametric and stands for the distribution under the alternative hypothesis. Motivated by the issue of local false discovery rate estimation, we focus here on the estimation of the nonparametric unknown component $f$ in the mixture, relying on a preliminary estimator of the unknown proportion $\theta$ of true null hypotheses. We propose and study the asymptotic properties of two different estimators for this unknown component. The first estimator is a randomly weighted kernel estimator. We establish an upper bound for its pointwise quadratic risk, exhibiting the classical nonparametric rate of convergence over a class of H\""older densities. To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing convergence as well as corresponding rate for the estimation of the unknown component in this nonparametric mixture. The second estimator is a maximum smoothed likelihood estimator. It is computed through an iterative algorithm, for which we establish a descent property. In addition, these estimators are used in a multiple testing procedure in order to estimate the local false discovery rate. Their respective performances are then compared on synthetic data.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Van Hanh Nguyen"", ids = ""47371317""); list(name = ""Catherine Matias"", ids = ""3222913"")",537aef561443c68de003b1235779f8a174924b24; 054ec1ed66ad695cb85095dcc3be119c99a76c9b; 1837a713040ac277509635842713e76a05cc909d; a990d6a91a7a1c0a11dafc34753b9af143c1de56,379daa0dabeffa72b9a0d8c48b361236c03fb302; 886d0844172e5fdd27a1f49e25592588c2c36414; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 422adc24881a92ba1d934dc7bc1b686764e6336e; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; 30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98; 19191f20f38818c898c99bcfa1c4722679e1d0ae; 81b701cffbe068270e50481a4c97a2d584c9ad52; bdfb57141b2141095ed942b28be24808aeba8d54; a0184a212d95b35ab6c58900707046eefb3e2b9d; 4c9b493adfd44f2359722273ec14e6303c72d877; b211079aac55cd6ddb136e4f37b4f90f2ccefda4; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; 92b17cce35f36051f2eb22710ea8fc2123ae63f3; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; 28a64cf5b569ede94dc2eaf242f1f23381145575; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; d0001d0cad4b1ac2b98230bbeab6aef822379293; 1d5996f89ca5b84a53e655b35df10636aa12805a; 0cb64a5dc4b4ebca3a3e1d3d50c4ae74ce7c5af2; fd3d628f90e73744621c26421869d90e7eddeb3f; e090e8cac0b2c79f3d53f6d61952bbd2d5d69c86; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; d60004fb5fe01f2ae4aacbb5f3839ed97d307661,arXiv: Applications,,584-612
f998a9a31230a626eb14096c72373b7cb9b42198,Use of variation in sex steroid methyl transferases to predict efficacy of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in advanced prostate cancer.,"14 Background: We evaluated the association of germline variation in genes regulating hormonal pathways with duration of treatment response in prostate cancer patients receiving ADT, focusing on genes in the androgen biosynthesis (the C4 Î”; C5 Î”; C21 CYP pathways and the alternate ""backdoor pathway"") and metabolism pathways.


METHODS
We successfully genotyped 747 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 84 genes in a cohort of 304 patients with advanced prostate cancer who progressed on ADT. Tagging SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of >5% and r2 â‰¥0.8 were selected from HapMap, NIEHS and Seattle SNP databases. The primary endpoint was time to ADT failure, and we conducted a gene-level test (principal components), along with individual SNP level tests adjusted for patient age and Gleason score. To account for multiple testing, we calculated the false discovery rate (FDR), and FDRs of 0.10 were considered noteworthy.


RESULTS
The median age of the cohort at ADT failure was 72 years (range 65-78 years), and the overall median time to ADT failure was 3.21 years (IQ [25-75]: 1.54-6.20 years). At the gene level, TRMT11 (tRNA methyltransferase 11 homologue) showed the strongest association with time to ADT failure (p<0.0008; adjusted p-value for FDR-0.068). Two of four TRMT11 tag SNPs were associated with time to ADT failure. The first was the intronic SNP rs1268121 (A>G) with a MAF of 15%, for which there was a positive association of median time to ADT failure with the number of variant alleles (p=0.023): 3.1 years for 0, 4.1 years for 1, and 5.9 years for 2 variant alleles. The second was the SNP rs6900796 (A>G) in the 3' untranscribed region with a MAF of 49%, for which the median time to ADT failure was 2.6 years for 0, 2.5 years for 1, and 3.8 years for 2 variant alleles (p=0.023). Four additional genes showed an association with ADT response at the p<0.10 level, including LOC390956, PRMT3, SLC7A6OS, and WBSCR22, although all FDRs were >0.95.


CONCLUSIONS
Variation in TRMT11 was associated with time to ADT failure. Confirmation of these findings in an independent cohort is needed.

Background: Thyroid cancer cells typically harbor multiple genomic aberrations that drive malignant transformation. The goal of this study was to identify novel genetic markers to improve preoperative discrimination between benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms.

Methods: Using Illumina HumanHap550 BeadChip with 561,446 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markÂ¬ers, we estimated copy number (CN) across the genome on 39 thyroid tumors with matched normal tissue, which included 14 benign tumors (follicular adenomas, FAs) and 25 malignant tumors (13 follicular variant papillary thyroid cancers, FVPTCs, and 12 papillary thyroid cancers, PTCs). The CirÂ¬cuÂ¬lar Binary SegÂ¬menÂ¬taÂ¬tion (CBS) algoÂ¬rithm was applied to calculate copy number variation (CNV) based on Log R Ratio (LRR) values. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis was performed by using LOH Score plug-in in BeadStudio program. Within the regions showing CNV, candidate genes were further examined by real-time PCR.

Results: The comprehensive genetic profile of 39 thyroid tumors was defined, and tumor -specific somatic change assessed using matched normal thyroid tissue as reference. With strict control of the false discovery rate, significant alterations averaged 32 CNVs in benign FAs, and 8 in malignant thyroid cancer (PTCs and FVPTCs), including 17 gains in FAs and 3 gains in cancers, and 2.9 losses in FAs and 4.4 losses in cancers. Additionally, an average of 12 copy-neutral LOHs per FA and 1 LOH per cancer were detected. Among the CNVs, we found 60 focal alterations that were specific either for benign FAs, or for thyroid cancers. We used empirical Bayes modified ANOVA to identify genes for which copy number was associated with tumor type. Increases in copy number on chromosome 12 were much more common in FAs than in cancers. GDF3, a candidate gene located in 12p13.31, was further validated by quantitative real time PCR, which showed results consistent with our SNP array results. Overall, follicular adenomas showed considerably higher levels of copy number variation than the two malignant tumor subtypes studied, i.e. PTCs and FVPTCs.

Conclusions: Benign and malignant thyroid tumors may possess characteristic and distinguishable genomic profiles. The genetic changes identified in this study may allow the development of biomarkers for differentiation of benign and malignant thyroid nodules.

In the next phase of this study, we will perform a transcriptome-wide expression analysis on the same tissue sample set used for the SNP array study, and perform an integrated analysis combining DNA genetic alterations and differential gene expression to further refine the identification of candidate molecular changes that may be used in differentiating benign from malignant thyroid lesions.

ea7b4946daccdcffc3c4f58c1f933152f79ca902,First-trimester multimarker prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus using targeted mass spectrometry,"Aims/hypothesisGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia, macrosomia and the future development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in both mother and child. Although an early and accurate prediction of GDM is needed to allow intervention and improve perinatal outcome, no single protein biomarker has yet proven useful for this purpose. In the present study, we hypothesised that multimarker panels of serum proteins can improve first-trimester prediction of GDM among obese and non-obese women compared with single markers.MethodsA nested caseâ€“control study was performed on first-trimester serum samples from 199 GDM cases and 208 controls, each divided into an obese group (BMI â‰¥27Â kg/m2) and a non-obese group (BMI <27Â kg/m2). Based on their biological relevance to GDM or type 2 diabetes mellitus or on their previously reported potential as biomarkers for these diseases, a number of proteins were selected for targeted nano-flow liquid chromatography (LC) MS analysis. This resulted in the development and validation of a 25-plex multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) MS assay.ResultsAfter false discovery rate correction, six proteins remained significantly different (p<0.05) between obese GDM patients (n=135) and BMI-matched controls (n=139). These included adiponectin, apolipoprotein M and apolipoprotein D. Multimarker models combining protein levels and clinical data were then constructed and evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. For the obese, non-obese and all GDM groups, these models achieved marginally higher AUCs compared with adiponectin alone.Conclusions/interpretationMultimarker models combining protein markers and clinical data have the potential to predict women at a high risk of developing GDM.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tina Ravnsborg"", ids = ""11283377""); list(name = ""Lise Lotte Torvin Andersen"", ids = ""3730490""); list(name = ""Natacha D.

9bcedeb03df94488a0d4d42b253368cae9cf0dc6,GPA: A Microbial Genetic Polymorphisms Assignments Tool in Metagenomic Analysis by Bayesian Estimation,"Identifying antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria in metagenomics samples is essential for public health and food safety. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has provided a powerful tool in identifying the genetic variation and constructing the correlations between genotype and phenotype in humans and other species. However, for complex bacterial samples, there lacks a powerful bioinformatic tool to identify genetic polymorphisms or copy number variations (CNVs) for given genes. Here we provide a Bayesian framework for genotype estimation for mixtures of multiple bacteria, named as Genetic Polymorphisms Assignments (GPA). Simulation results showed that GPA has reduced the false discovery rate (FDR) and mean absolute error (MAE) in CNV and single nucleotide variant (SNV) identification. This framework was validated by whole-genome sequencing and Pool-seq data from Klebsiella pneumoniae with multiple bacteria mixture models, and showed the high accuracy in the allele fraction detections of CNVs and SNVs in AMR genes between two populations. The quantitative study on the changes of AMR genes fraction between two samples showed a good consistency with the AMR pattern observed in the individual strains. Also, the framework together with the genome annotation and population comparison tools has been integrated into an application, which could provide a complete solution for AMR gene identification and quantification in unculturable clinical samples.

822ff547d0b938c8b19b3027fbbcaa3617d981b1,Comments on: Control of the false discovery rate underÂ dependence using the bootstrap and subsampling,"I would like to commend the authors on a really nice piece of work. It is well written and gives a very general solution to the problem of bootstrap adjustment for multiplicity while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). At the time that I was working on the normal-theory FDR controlling procedure (Troendle 2000), I had ideas about resampling-based FDR control. However, I have reservations about using FDRcontrolling procedures in applications, which led me to discontinue my research on them. The false discovery proportion (FDP) seems like the most natural thing to control when control of the familywise error rate is not needed. In applications there is only one FDP generated, and the bottom line question is â€œwhat can you claim about the likelihood of a large FDP with this set of rejected hypotheses?â€ Even with exact (as opposed to asymptotic) FDR control, the answer is â€œnot much.â€ That is because the FDR is an expected value and says nothing about the tail behavior of the FDP. A simple realistic example give in Korn et al. (2004) showed that a procedure controlling the FDR at 0.1 has an actual FDP â‰¥ 0.29 with probability 0.1. One exciting possibility to take from this paper is that the subsampling ideas given in Sect. 6 might be extended to control of the FDP. The fact that the subsampling procedure did not behave well in the simulations for fairly small sample sizes is discouraging, but perhaps that can be overcome. It may take a lot of computation to get satisfactory results because the sample size should be large (for approximately asymptotic behavior to be expected), while the subsample size should also be large yet small relative to the sample size. There are a tremendous number of such subsets",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""James F. Troendle"", ids = ""143998675"")",0725893c81e1ea0131e27ffab61c31900f9bef05,,TEST,17,456-457
e1114f881d2f84b1b0d787a66ea654a5bfd80d4a,A mixture model approach to sample size estimation in two-sample comparative microarray experiments,"BackgroundChoosing the appropriate sample size is an important step in the design of a microarray experiment, and recently methods have been proposed that estimate sample sizes for control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR). Many of these methods require knowledge of the distribution of effect sizes among the differentially expressed genes. If this distribution can be determined then accurate sample size requirements can be calculated.ResultsWe present a mixture model approach to estimating the distribution of effect sizes in data from two-sample comparative studies. Specifically, we present a novel, closed form, algorithm for estimating the noncentrality parameters in the test statistic distributions of differentially expressed genes. We then show how our model can be used to estimate sample sizes that control the FDR together with other statistical measures like average power or the false nondiscovery rate. Method performance is evaluated through a comparison with existing methods for sample size estimation, and is found to be very good.ConclusionA novel method for estimating the appropriate sample size for a two-sample comparative microarray study is presented.

5af0d232011bf85d7dc88223fb88fee9d0b895a1,Decreased EEG Spectral Power and Increased Cortico-Cortical Connectivity Correlate with Structural MRI Changes in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (P2.036),"Objective: To identify the changes in the neural activity and cortico-cortical connectivity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using high-density electroencephalography and its correlates with structural MRI. Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of upper and/or lower motor neurons with white matter changes in the corticospinal, corticobulbar, commissural and frontotemporal regions. Evaluation of functional cortical connectivity can shed light on the underlying affected brain regions and networks, and hence the disease pathophysiology. Design/Methods: Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 128 channels in 3 sets (2 minutes each) from 100 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (78 spinal onset, 15 bulbar onset, 7 ALS-FTD, age: 60.2 Â± 11.1), 8 patients with frontotemporal dementia (separately recruited and analysed), and 34 age-matched healthy individuals. The ALS-specific functional connectivity was quantified using frequency-domain cortico-cortical coherence and spectral power of the EEG. Results: The patient groups showed: lower spectral power in Î¸ band but higher coherence in Î¸ and Î³ bands. This decrease in the spectral power was mapped to specific brain sources in each frequency band. These findings were statistically significant as assessed by adaptive false discovery rate, fdr, (q = 0.05) and were confirmed by empirical Bayesian inference for the changes in spectral power and cortico-cortical coherence. Structural MRI scores were correlated with EEG changes in a subset of 51 spinal-onset patients. Degeneration in motor cortical regions and corticospinal tracts were primarily correlated with changes in spectral power, whereas increased coherences on EEG correlated with extra-motor regions on MRI Conclusions: The decreased spectral power in motor areas are a direct consequence of the structural degeneration and the increased coherences reflect increased functional connectivity in the brain networks which may be a compensatory neural activity. Spectral EEG is a promising biomarker of neurodegeneration, and provides additional information that complements structural changes detected by MRI.

RATIONALE: The prevalence of eczema among children of industrialized countries is increasing. There is some evidence that DNAmethylation plays a role in eczema, however, there is lack of epi-genome-wide study on their association. METHODS: Association between eczema and DNA methylation was studied in 18year-old subjects (n5366) from the Isle of Wight (IOW) birth Cohort. To efficiently screen cytosine-phospate-guanine (CpG) sites in epi-genome-wide, we applied the approach of random forest (RF) ensemble. A total of 307,357 CpGs were subjected to random forest data reduction, repeatedly dropping 50% of variables with lowest variable importance measures until the misclassification rate showed a significant increase. Functional annotation and pathway analyses along with logistic regressions were performed to further evaluate the selected RF-CpG sites. RESULTS: The RF method yielded 75 CpGs, 72 of which are linked to eczema corroborated by logistic regression. Eczema-associated CpGs, e.g., in genes PARD3 and GUCY1A3, were significantly enriched within the pathways â€˜Tight junctionâ€™ and â€˜Gap junctionâ€™ (P values 0.0008 and 0.002 respectively, after correcting for multiple testing with false discovery rate of 0.05). It has been shown that genes in these pathways are correlated to allergic and immune related diseases. CONCLUSIONS: TheRFEnsemblemethodwas successfully utilized for epigenome-wide scanning to identify epigenetic loci associated with eczema, detecting both previously known and novel CpG sites. The significant enrichment of differentially methylated CpGs within tight and gap junction pathway genes implicates epigenetic regulation in epidermal barrier dysfunction in eczema.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Elizabeth Simms"", ids = ""21248274""); list(name = ""Christopher D.

a74af33581cdf4fcdb33b2dec65f294ab644a9d5,Association between two polymorphisms of CD166/ALCAM gene and breast cancer risk in Chinese women,"We read with great interest the article by Zhou et al. [1], which investigated two polymorphisms of CD166/ALCAM gene and breast cancer risk in Chinese women. This study was very important as it represented the first study exploring the association of this gene with breast cancer risk. Their results suggested that rs6437585 polymorphism was significantly associated with breast cancer risk under dominant genetic model (CT?TT vs. CC: odds ratio=1.38, 95% confidence interval = 1.11â€“1.72). However, no significant association was detected for rs11559013 polymorphism. The gene expression experiment further supported the significant association between rs6437585 polymorphism and breast cancer risk. However, we have other two comments on the study. First, as they investigated two polymorphisms and three comparisons for each polymorphism (taking rs6437585 as an example, three comparisons included TT vs. CC, CT vs. CC, CT?TT vs. CC, respectively). Totally, they performed six comparisons for the two polymorphisms, i.e. rs6437585 and rs11559013 polymorphisms. Therefore, an adjustment for multiple testing was required to avoid false positive findings [2, 3]. The methods for adjustment for multiple comparisons included Bonferroni correction, permutation test and false discovery rate test [4]. Second, in the statistical analysis section, they stated that the geneâ€“gene and geneâ€“environmental interactions were evaluated with logistic regression model. However, in the results section, they just claimed that â€˜The increased risk of breast cancer associated with the rs6437585 polymorphism was found to vary according to an individualâ€™s age, age at menarche, menstrual history, BMI, and family history of breast cancerâ€™ and â€˜For the rs11559013 polymorphism, no significant associations were found in any of the subgroupsâ€™. Why the detailed results were not presented in the full text? In our opinion, geneâ€“gene and geneâ€“environmental interactions analyses are more important than single locus analysis, as the comprehensive analyses with consideration of both gene and environment could provide us with more deeply understanding of the pathogenesis of breast cancer [5]. Third, in the discussion section, they stated that â€˜We also achieved over 90% study power (two-sided test, a = 0.05) in detecting an OR of 1.38 for the rs6437585 TT?CT genotypes (which occurred at a frequency of 21.7% in the controls), relative to the rs6437585 CC genotypeâ€™. However, the power calculation is usually performed with a prior test but not a post test. In addition, what was the statistical power for rs11559013 polymorphism? Although the several issues existed in the article, it first demonstrated the association between CD166/ALCAM rs6437585 polymorphism and breast cancer risk and it will provide us with some insights in the mechanism of breast cancer. Further well-designed studies with large sample size are still needed to confirm the association in other ethnic populations.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Qinglong Li"", ids = ""48933849""); list(name = ""Feng Xu"", ids = ""143702409"")",1bad012d595ea6ee1527caab48d0b7a1c2b03709,c6d442e325d21fbdd57103589d9aea44407cafcc; 20564e507aced1cb204e59894d70fd7b6ec3adc4; f29ef6b0a8328740ca33d8f811c5b4ccb7062a7d; 1c717b51702647b0933eeaf55d6a85e62f4ffa02,Breast Cancer Research and Treatment,129,645-647
44a399ac9524bd4ed61615b888259538a5aabef4,Associations of Radiomic Data Extracted from Static and Respiratory-Gated CT Scans with Disease Recurrence in Lung Cancer Patients Treated with SBRT,"Radiomics aims to quantitatively capture the complex tumor phenotype contained in medical images to associate them with clinical outcomes. This study investigates the impact of different types of computed tomography (CT) images on the prognostic performance of radiomic features for disease recurrence in early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). 112 early stage NSCLC patients treated with SBRT that had static free breathing (FB) and average intensity projection (AIP) images were analyzed. Nineteen radiomic features were selected from each image type (FB or AIP) for analysis based on stability and variance. The selected FB and AIP radiomic feature sets had 6 common radiomic features between both image types and 13 unique features. The prognostic performances of the features for distant metastasis (DM) and locoregional recurrence (LRR) were evaluated using the concordance index (CI) and compared with two conventional features (tumor volume and maximum diameter). P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate procedure. None of the FB radiomic features were associated with DM, however, seven AIP radiomic features, that described tumor shape and heterogeneity, were (CI range: 0.638-0.676). Conventional features from FB images were not associated with DM, however, AIP conventional features were (CI range: 0.643-0.658). Radiomic and conventional multivariate models were compared between FB and AIP images using cross validation. The differences between the models were assessed using a permutation test. AIP radiomic multivariate models (median CI = 0.667) outperformed all other models (median CI range: 0.601-0.630) in predicting DM. None of the imaging features were prognostic of LRR. Therefore, image type impacts the performance of radiomic models in their association with disease recurrence. AIP images contained more information than FB images that were associated with disease recurrence in early stage NSCLC patients treated with SBRT, which suggests that AIP images may potentially be more optimal for the development of an imaging biomarker.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Elizabeth Huynh"", ids = ""4699641""); list(name = ""Thibaud P Coroller"", ids = ""3649776""); list(name = ""Vivek Narayan"", ids = ""122499470""); list(name = ""Vishesh Agrawal"", ids = ""7865880""); list(name = ""John Romano"", ids = ""145643511""); list(name = ""Idalid Franco"", ids = ""32149499""); list(name = ""Chintan Parmar"", ids = ""40470674""); list(name = ""Ying Hou"", ids = ""144196063""); list(name = ""Raymond H.

885ece3e379f1adb28bc8e0f0237083374e5e3db,DNA methylation and hormone receptor status in breast cancer,"BackgroundWe examined whether differences in tumor DNA methylation were associated with more aggressive hormone receptor-negative breast cancer in an ethnically diverse group of patients in the Breast Cancer Care in Chicago (BCCC) study and using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).ResultsDNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples on 75 patients (21 White, 31 African-American, and 23 Hispanic) (training dataset) enrolled in the BCCC. Hormone receptor status was defined as negative if tumors were negative for both estrogen and progesterone (ER/PR) receptors (Nâ€‰=â€‰22/75). DNA methylation was analyzed at 1505 CpG sites within 807 gene promoters using the Illumina GoldenGate assay. Differential DNA methylation as a predictor of hormone receptor status was tested while controlling for false discovery rate and assigned to the gene closest to the respective CpG site. Next, those genes that predicted ER/PR status were validated using TCGA data with respect to DNA methylation (validation dataset), and correlations between CpG methylation and gene expression were examined. In the training dataset, 5.7Â % of promoter mean methylation values (46/807) were associated with receptor status at Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05; for 88Â % of these (38/46), hypermethylation was associated with receptor-positive disease. Hypermethylation for FZD9, MME, BCAP31, HDAC9, PAX6, SCGB3A1, PDGFRA, IGFBP3, and PTGS2 genes most strongly predicted receptor-positive disease. Twenty-one of 24 predictor genes from the training dataset were confirmed in the validation dataset. The level of DNA methylation at 19 out 22 genes, for which gene expression data were available, was associated with gene activity.ConclusionsHigher levels of promoter methylation strongly correlate with hormone receptor positive status of breast tumors. For most of the genes identified in our training dataset as ER/PR receptor status predictors, DNA methylation correlated with stable gene expression level. The predictors performed well when evaluated on independent set of samples, with different racioethnic distribution, thus providing evidence that this set of DNA methylation biomarkers will likely generalize to prospective patient samples.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Elizaveta V Benevolenskaya"", ids = ""4003299""); list(name = ""Abul B.M.M.K.

However, resistance to endocrine therapies remains a major problem in the management of ER-positive breast cancer. Recently, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) show promise as cancer therapeutics, but the full scope of their utility remains unknown. Experimental Design: In order to search for critical genes in developing resistance to AI, a microarray study was performed on AI resistant cells derived from MCF-7aro cells that overexpress aromatase and on AI resistant tumors from our mouse experiments. Moreover, using MCF-7aro cells that are resistant to anastrozole (Ana-R), letrozole (Let-R), and exemestane (Exe-R), as well as LTEDaro, we evaluated the significance of NFKB1 and several regulatory genes in AI resistance, and the anti-NFÎºB1 activity of HDACi LBH589 in vitro and in vivo. Results: Significant changes (Fold change cutoff > 1.5, false discovery rate in vitro and in vivo models of acquired AI resistance. NFKB1 is a key player in one of three networks, including 11 genes, and is functionally up-regulated in all AI resistant cells. NFÎºB1 knockdown suppresses the proliferation of AI resistant cells more than that of MCF-7aro cells. Moreover, AI resistant cell lines are highly sensitive to LBH589 treatment and apoptosis is induced in these cell lines. LBH589 suppressed NFÎºB1 as demonstrated at both the mRNA and protein levels in LTEDaro and other AI resistant cell lines. Furthermore, the LBH589 treatment abrogated tumor growth in mice, and was associated with significant decreased levels of NFKB1 in tumors. Conclusions: Our findings provide new insights into how the NFÎºB1-mediated networks play roles in AI resistance, and strongly support that LBH589 offers a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with AI resistant breast cancer.

In the current study DNA microarrays were used to evaluate global mRNA expression in liver tissue of male chicken embryos that exhibited the above mentioned effects. Injected doses were dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle control, 7.6 or 45 Î¼g TDCPP/g egg. TDCPP caused significant changes in the expression of five genes at the low dose and 47 genes at the high dose (False Discovery Rate p â‰¤ 0.1, fold change â‰¥ 1.5). The gene expression analysis suggested a compromised immune function, a state of cholestatic liver/biliary fibrosis, and disrupted lipid and steroid metabolism. Circulating bile acid levels were elevated, which is an indication of liver dysfunction, and plasma cholesterol levels were reduced; however, hepatic bile acid and cholesterol levels were unaltered. Interactome analyses identified apolipoprotein E, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha as key regulatory molecules involved in the effects of TDCPP. Our results demonstrate a targeted effect of TDCPP toxicity on lipid metabolism, including cholesterol, that helps explain the aforementioned phenotypic effects, as chicken embryos are highly dependent on yolk lipids for growth and maintenance throughout development. Finally, our results are in concordance with the literature that describes TDCPP as a cancer-causing agent, since the majority of dysregulated genes were involved in cancer pathways.",2014,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Amani Farhat"", ids = ""10224468""); list(name = ""Julie K.

d3b7d718bfabcda00dd31c36233393493639c7c1,QuickMod: A tool for open modification spectrum library searches.,"MS2 library spectra are rich in reproducible information about peptide fragmentation patterns compared to theoretical spectra modeled by a sequence search tool. So far, spectrum library searches are mostly applied to detect peptides as they are present in the library. However, they also allow finding modified variants of the library peptides if the search is done with a large precursor mass window and an adapted Spectrum-Spectrum Match (SSM) scoring algorithm. We perform a thorough evaluation on the use of library spectra as opposed to theoretical peptide spectra for the identification of PTMs, analyzing spectra of a well-annotated modification-rich test data set compiled from public data repositories. These initial studies motivate the development of our modification tolerant spectrum library search tool QuickMod, designed to identify modified variants of the peptides listed in the spectrum library without any prior input from the user estimating the modifications present in the sample. We built the search algorithm of QuickMod after carefully testing different SSM similarity scores. The final spectrum scoring scheme uses a support vector machine (SVM) on a selection of scoring features to classify correct and incorrect SSM. After identification of a list of modified peptides at a given False Discovery Rate (FDR), the modifications need to be positioned on the peptide sequence. We present a rapid modification site assignment algorithm and evaluate its positioning accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that QuickMod performs favorably in terms of speed and identification rate when compared to other software solutions for PTM analysis.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Erik AhrnÃ©"", ids = ""47842974""); list(name = ""FrÃ©dÃ©ric Nikitin"", ids = ""2508611""); list(name = ""FrÃ©dÃ©rique Lisacek"", ids = ""2258235""); list(name = ""Markus MÃ¼ller"", ids = ""50098432"")",5561b3b7327722697d79e0ca76b15638148945f5; ca68a0546d34b71fd7947b3e80bd99821487c412; 9d6e00124021f60a29f34ea8dc3ab5d35bda5ecc; b7c52b880b41a77c82d2f9d917adee1867496d44; 9c67b5dd41c31ff37d6e2a89935eb7eb3df27a38; 5b1acc92e8eee4556a84ab7ebc6230794a55c93a; fcfecfd9e216f2f2d0736625e7249af5d0ede908; 0173401e7dcc73eb2f610bc79c0e24cf212e85bc; 904fc9dd87401daece9dcd0c30e0c00d88b1bd8a; a4c5dda96c9237eb9eef796ef4c343f98dc1e50b; deb9bd5c453437f31e72eea77884029780d1a042; 91cbc7367f291e1836f21ba5a75dce2453bd8da4; e418cb8a3881f73501b3d3e84a9e028aa7c4fc52; f965f0ea0d7ae12f0fc0443a574ce7d450c40a1b; 273cc1549b285dc5999c70eef1e8d6b4c88dbd5d; de3ec55bb6525a869b022e0763a355d26001e25f; 496a6eb35e578ad7ace17a8eb5063d29fb00ebc7; b89b686c89129e1298daffd9c21072cbf346b714; 93dcd59dd4d2978173d50dd96994169396271068; 01a7c972aff1c5463acc17f1eb5796789a9a5d61; 06445d1c1d28c7658a7649cffb9d302bfa709f6d; aade96416d759fb38681e7886b93e6849eda3112; ce086a320436d8610e413397829f2204d26ddd7b; 997f59c159bd90b0ac03b628a16f532f8aeeeb9e; ea40dfcff7af12f43188703c269ad2c350dfc875; a3a8da2e39a5ec224719bb0f65898c258f9f1da1; 362acd5fcf13c1d0e5cf4d4f9ac7bc7cee7981e7; e133a7269aface4dc172c64eea8d743326f5f3be; 3767243e735b57b2f62632aebf1c1d13e629a6f5,,Journal of proteome research,10 7,"

9cfeef63648dcf8e3ae885cc3a3c4743326741d7,Suppression of skeletal muscle turnover in cancer cachexia: evidence from the transcriptome in sequential human muscle biopsies.,"PURPOSE
The mechanisms underlying muscle wasting in patients with cancer remain poorly understood, and consequently there remains an unmet clinical need for new biomarkers and treatment strategies.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Microarrays were used to examine the transcriptome in single biopsies from healthy controls (n = 6) and in paired biopsies [pre-resection baseline (weight-loss 7%) and 8 month post-resection follow-up (disease-free/weight-stable for previous 2 months)] from quadriceps muscle of patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer (UGIC; n = 12).


RESULTS
Before surgery, 1,868 genes were regulated compared with follow-up (false discovery rate, 6%). Ontology analysis showed that regulated genes belonged to both anabolic and catabolic biologic processes with overwhelming downregulation in baseline samples. No literature-derived genes from preclinical cancer cachexia models showed higher expression in baseline muscle. Comparison with healthy control muscle (n = 6) revealed that despite differences in the transcriptome at baseline (941 genes regulated), the muscle of patients at follow-up was similar to control muscle (2 genes regulated). Physical activity (step count per day) did not differ between the baseline and follow-up periods (P = 0.9), indicating that gene expression differences reflected the removal of the cancer rather than altered physical activity levels. Comparative gene expression analysis using exercise training signatures supported this interpretation.


CONCLUSIONS
Metabolic and protein turnover-related pathways are suppressed in weight-losing patients with UGIC whereas removal of the cancer appears to facilitate a return to a healthy state, independent of changes in the level of physical activity.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Iain Gallagher"", ids = ""2368386""); list(name = ""Nathan A.

Materials and Methods: Pathway data were obtained from the Reactome database. Next, the average Z algorithm was utilized to compute the iPAS. The disrupted pathways in a PE sample were identified by means of t test according to the pathway statistics values of normal and PE samples. In addition, we screened the differential expressed genes (DEGs) using SAMR package and constructed the differential co-expression network comprising DEGs. Subsequently, topological analysis for the co-expression network was conducted to identify hub genes. Results: Under the threshold of false discovery rate <0.05, 69 disrupted pathways were selected. Among them, formation of tubulin-folding intermediates by containing t-complex polypeptide 1 (CCT)/TCP1 ring complex (TriC) was the most remarkable pathway. Degree analysis for co-expression network of DEGs suggested that there were several hub-disrupted pathway-related genes, for instance, TCP1 and TUBA1A. More importantly, these two hub genes were enriched in the most significant pathway of formation of tubulin-folding intermediates by CCT/TriC. Conclusion: The iPAS method is suitable for identifying disrupted pathways in PE. Pathway of formation of tubulin folding intermediates by CCT/TriC might play important roles in PE.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ying Luo"", ids = ""51076142""); list(name = ""Xiao-chen Ma"", ids = ""9279871""); list(name = ""Qing Gao"", ids = ""145173780""); list(name = ""Lu-Quan Cao"", ids = ""66749257"")",,,Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics,14,1644 - 1649

Coupled with an abundant and pure source of HLA, we set out to detect and identify ligands that are at or below the sensitivity of T-cell detection. The overall objective of this study was to apply cutting-edge proteomics techniques to dramatically improve our understanding of the peptide ligands that are presented by HLA of infected cells. Methods To identify HLA presented peptide ligands at high sensitivity, we utilized Deep Ligand Sequencing (DLS), an approach that funnels milligrams of HLA into a lingand pool that are analyzed in a two-dimensional LCMS system. Here, the characterized HLA was sHLA-A*02:01 harvested from T. gondii infected THP-1 cells. Peptide ligands were released from A*02:01 with an acid boil and separated into 40 fractions by RP-HLPC at pH10. Peptides in each of these 40 fractions were separated again using nano RP-HPLC at pH2, and the peptides were analyzed with an AB Sciex 5600 triple TOF mass spectrometer as they eluted from the nano column. Peptide sequences are determined using PEAKS and MASCOT at a 1% False Discovery Rate. All T. gondii sequences were validated with fragmentation of corresponding synthetic peptides. Results The DLS technique found that 201 novel T. gondii ligands from 97 proteins are presented by A*02:01. Of these ligands, 15% (31/201) came from the known antigenic dense granular proteins and 36 of the ligands were from 21 different hypothetical T. gondii proteins, confirming the expression of these hypothetical proteins. Strikingly, an additional 113 ligands share sequence between T. gondii and H. sapiens. Conclusions Cutting-edge mass spectrometers coupled to nano HPLC systems and high throughput bioinfromatic software has allowed us to survey the ligandome with an unprecedented depth. Here we applied these techniques to an intracellular pathogen and identified over 200 novel T. gondii ligands from a single HLA. These data will revolutionize T cell therapies for targeting infected cells. C. McMurtrey: Consultant; Company/Organization; Pure Protein LLC . W.

In some applications, covariates have natural grouping structures, where those in the same group have correlated measurements or related functions. Under such settings, variable selection should be conducted at both the group-level and within-group-level, that is, a bi-level selection. In this study, we propose the adaptive sparse group Lasso (adSGL) method, which combines the adaptive Lasso and adaptive group Lasso (GL) to achieve bi-level selection. It can be viewed as an improved version of sparse group Lasso (SGL) and uses data-dependent weights to improve selection performance. For computation, a block coordinate descent algorithm is adopted. Simulation shows that adSGL has satisfactory performance in identifying both individual variables and groups and lower false discovery rate and mean square error than SGL and GL.

In this study, a semi-online 2-D LC separation strategy based on three-step fractionation of the enriched peptides on strong anion-exchange trap column was developed. It was demonstrated that the sensitivity and phosphoproteome coverage obtained by this fractionating method with strong anion-exchange trap column is much higher than those by the conventional methods based on C18 trap column. In addition, when the same amount of sample was loaded, the number of identified phosphopeptides had increased 108%. Combination of this three-step fractionation method with RPLC-MS/MS analysis by 300 min RP-gradient separation was applied to phosphoproteome analysis of human liver proteins, and 853 unique phosphopeptides was positively identified from 500 microg tryptic digest of human liver proteins. After three cycles' consecutive analyses, 1554 unique phosphopeptides and 1566 phosphorylated sites were totally identified from 735 phosphorylated proteins at a false discovery rate of <1% in about 54 h of analysis time.",2010,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Fangjun Wang"", ids = ""6872342""); list(name = ""Guanghui Han"", ids = ""2626307""); list(name = ""Zhiyuan Yu"", ids = ""98228048""); list(name = ""Xinning Jiang"", ids = ""2702237""); list(name = ""Shutao Sun"", ids = ""1839048""); list(name = ""Rui Chen"", ids = ""144313206""); list(name = ""Mingliang Ye"", ids = ""8493740""); list(name = ""Hanfa Zou"", ids = ""3694471"")",2b1180904a896dc1940129e4ac680e9f563f4302; fa28e7929016103d177426c1d3d84403d3e11451; 3342c2b60b3f1a731604f1274fdfbdfc6e4371a6; 24860210d435899580fb4cc46e52035badd1a43b; 5d651af061eee9d85667af99105647dba2cf61c5; 03733f08e79acfaa1caf646a6750136f6979c9e9,,Journal of separation science,33 13,"

Materials and Methods T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images of 97 patients with schizophrenia (29 women; mean Â± standard deviation age, 41 years Â± 11.5; range, 16-66 years; illness duration, 16.3 years Â± 10.9; range, 0-50 years) and 126 age- and sex-matched (38 years Â± 14.9; range, 18-68 years; 42 women) healthy control subjects were evaluated. The causal network of structural covariance was used to assess the causal relationships of structural changes in patients with schizophrenia. This was accomplished by applying Granger causality analysis to the morphometric T1-weighted images ranked according to duration of disease. Results With greater disease duration, reduction in gray matter volume began in the thalamus and progressed to the frontal lobe, and then to the temporal and occipital cortices as well and the cerebellum (P < .00001, false discovery rate corrected). The thalamus was shown to be the primary hub of the directional network and exhibited positive causal effects on the frontal, temporal, and occipital regions as well as on the cerebellum (P < .05, false discovery rate corrected). The frontal regions, which were identified to be transitional points, projected causal effects to the occipital lobe, temporal regions, and the cerebellum and received causal effects from the thalamus (P < .05, false discovery rate corrected). Conclusion Schizophrenia shows progression of gray matter abnormalities over time, with the thalamus as the primary hub and the frontal regions as prominent nodes.

To evaluate the role of COMT gene variants as potential risk factors in a group of patients affected with chronic temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain.


METHODS
We sequenced COMT gene in 182 Italian subjects (50 affected by TMD and 132 controls). The study population consisted of patients affected by myogenous and/or arthrogenous pain (RDC/TMD: Ia, Ib, IIIa, IIIb diagnostic categories).


RESULTS
We detected 40 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) variants (18 novel). Three SNPs, all located in the promoter regions, were more frequently present in cases than in controls (rs 4646310 P=0.018, rs165656 P=0.001, rs 165722 P=0.007). After the False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction rs165656 remained significantly associated with TMD (P=0.049). In addition, the rs 4646310 (AG vs GG, P=0.015) and rs 165656 (GG vs CC, P=0.001) were at binary logistic regression analysis independently associated with TMD, conferring a risk disease of 2.6 (CI= 1.2-5.6) and of 5.3 (CI= 2.0-13.7) respectively.


DISCUSSION
Our data extend the number of SNPs present in the promoter region that could play a regulatory role in COMT gene and suggest that the genetic polymorphisms rs 165656 and rs 4646310 exert a role in TMD susceptibility.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ambrosina Michelotti"", ids = ""2410456""); list(name = ""Rosario Liguori"", ids = ""15890825""); list(name = ""Mario Toriello"", ids = ""3806822""); list(name = ""Vincenzo D'AntÃ²"", ids = ""1401214396""); list(name = ""Dino Vitale"", ids = ""46531444""); list(name = ""Giuseppe Castaldo"", ids = ""2485375""); list(name = ""Lucia Sacchetti"", ids = ""33155897"")",ac94e71bf819385a5d4254926e5649e582137138; 63349f6a69e48a8e002fde1517d76a178257ab41; 708073288bcafd7acbee2bc6d3585a2ef616ddc8; a891ef589c38d301ac93ba394293a23df216bb29; 5c500a035f33c4e2f13861401eef400b9b63804f; ad71e380feab827890d6eaaf8a2d17a71a982936; be6f5d46ac317d9a5081d328bdfd3d4bd949ebc8; 8eaa0d22ea7a6e62ef4e2b238adfb3ae3d8d20c2; 04df0514c5007e60e4eba7f05d492a73d62b86f4; 039b462f4e46026af75a2876486d23e2f4391b22; a46ea3272c8aa24c38a5699cd11f13d7eaf7f834; de95c286a8deaaa1a0d1deed006c9cf5c07968ef,04a69d418bcd245bd96fa20cf2d8f6c0441d6839; 4a54f47ca410fe2468218383a1c288f293db7389; 09f96e7bc6192a74185be7e84eba18c3cc71be8e; b1978abc3e40d242aea055b8ef9bf58b3dc6e458; 351f800c4ef5ffb1108574b36002aebe025f0596; a439471e2209902296e6497cd6a33f27449be760; 030b277c96334e44911b6b3905507807ac44a17f; a98a40485c94a700260f8867f83d6d8942c873a1; c0b25e54d3ccef9070e9a84dec2032871aa2148a; ad4b2b063615b41e234ee0024f84b9079ba28be3; 6bfc3be6d364e9f334817be93b529f3c8cec884a; 8a98184b6f3ee1ac03d46cc5c3d208570901f159; 0dd3f765bbb45d1396c0a61d65ea5ce6a69237b2; 6098bfe07b1f175f8d9e8293d84d41fe581cb138; 9e8db3f1656596978a14719aeba4f19c6aa5c0ae; bbcd6f62d8417efb849318d94179561802ac9a8c; 34d2a59006fff29f38e9cb2fb7037462c262cef0; e963804872ee18c2ced6ec52aa2960dc1a6c6414; 8f4728220e21556ccda1a1e8101ea1330161cdad; f9af42c6640b524d49f2bc7a20fbb447892ce85e; 51a5bb8cd7b19c6ca1504f807879074a61e8be12; abd41d071fac48c0d199f4bf4ce4ab7ca37420b2; 17c29ba6a990dbb0bb3cdd83f8fb3dd872fd6528; 6eb4929cecf157c3564119e347c78f4419ebe3cc; ea9fa26d70a0b2770c68c65693e9468df4c2b2bd; 959ddf3e516540c7b6790d41455340b1f9e1f639; 83e0e1c41a3f01d02042c6660b8f12b92daf5cf3; 8582ed4f5d216a43d4a4b7340184e0c475575145; bf12c55f31443606a8e85b72ad378c45dfece8b9,The Clinical journal of pain,30 2,"

6e05c1896f79d86f6ffe6dad18831c2a330f9c4c,False Discovery Rate Control of Stepâ€Upâ€Down Tests with Special Emphasis on the Asymptotically Optimal Rejection Curve,".â€‚ This paper is concerned with exact control of the false discovery rate (FDR) for step-up-down (SUD) tests related to the asymptotically optimal rejection curve (AORC). Since the system of equations and/or constraints for critical values and FDRs is numerically extremely sensitive, existence and computation of valid solutions is a challenging problem. We derive explicit formulas for upper bounds of the FDR and show that under a well-known monotonicity condition, control of the FDR by a step-up procedure results in control of the FDR by a corresponding SUD procedure. Various methods for adjusting the AORC to achieve finite FDR control are investigated. Moreover, we introduce alternative FDR bounding curves and study their connection to rejection curves as well as the existence of critical values for exact FDR control with respect to the underlying FDR bounding curve. Finally, we propose an iterative method for the computation of critical values.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Helmut Finner"", ids = ""2839900""); list(name = ""Veronika Gontscharuk"", ids = ""4714530""); list(name = ""Thorsten Dickhaus"", ids = ""46649155"")",47d1f32aa0e760d570fdd57a95280f0618f1003a; 5f979b16d652f594af251c830cb0436aa5814a22; c117971e646e96ba2577f8a7f39246f021e08544; 0427e897a10582f7822e0c1ab5bef0459d8dfe59; 92f3a9e69314d9b6368a30feeb07bafc8b8dc0cf; 86f7e3884dc7c5921ead7c9531851595bdc98cd0; 451c2b09f99f7f99046863e8df49627776838e54; 4757f6e2038748d6b4f11e21bc96eae6e6b417eb; 0ac8035938e2077d300b5ca64f7303df2d2e54fd,,Scandinavian Journal of Statistics,39,382-397
af1737e74a53bf4ea2a3b8ac02122ff8dbeca221,Differential analyses for RNA-seq: transcript-level estimates improve gene-level inferences,"High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is used extensively to characterize the transcriptome of cells. Many transcriptomic studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest, such as genes or transcripts. Various quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential gene expression analyses on simple count matrices but thatÂ this can be addressed by incorporating offsets derived from transcript-level abundance estimates. We also show that the problem is relatively minor in several real data sets. Finally, we provide an R package ( tximport) to help users integrate transcript-level abundance estimates from common quantification pipelines into count-based statistical inference engines.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Charlotte Soneson"", ids = ""2761556""); list(name = ""Michael I.

e24f8c0d2ffdb98c56364a5d58b47b583bcf9987,Significance testing and genomic inflation factor using highâ€density genotypes or wholeâ€genome sequence data,"Significance testing for genome-wide association study (GWAS) with increasing SNP density up to whole-genome sequence data (WGS) is not straightforward, because of strong LD between SNP and population stratification. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate genomic control and different significance testing procedures using data from a commercial pig breeding scheme. A GWAS was performed in GCTA with data of 4,964 Large White pigs using medium density, high density or imputed whole-genome sequence data, fitting a genomic relationship matrix based on a leave-one-chromosome-out approach to account for population structure. Subsequently, genomic inflation factors were assessed on whole-genome level and the chromosome level. To establish a significance threshold, permutation testing, Bonferroni corrections using either the total number of SNPs or the number of independent chromosome fragments, and false discovery rates (FDR) using either the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure or the Benjamini and Yekutieli procedure were evaluated. We found that genomic inflation factors did not differ between different density genotypes but do differ between chromosomes. Also, the leave-one-chromosome-out approach for GWAS or using the pedigree relationships did not account appropriately for population stratification and gave strong genomic inflation. Regarding different procedures for significance testing, when the aim is to find QTL regions that are associated with a trait of interest, we recommend applying the FDR following the Benjamini and Yekutieli approach to establish a significance threshold that is adjusted for multiple testing. When the aim is to pinpoint a specific mutation, the more conservative Bonferroni correction based on the total number of SNPs is more appropriate, till an appropriate method is established to adjust for the number of independent tests.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sanne J P Van den Berg"", ids = ""9872291""); list(name = ""JÃ©rÃ©mie Vandenplas"", ids = ""4559197""); list(name = ""Fred A van Eeuwijk"", ids = ""1918088""); list(name = ""Marcos S Lopes"", ids = ""34036790""); list(name = ""Roel F.

b41124290666faaeef9113cd05fda8471a1f9a6d,Interpreting Black Box Models via Hypothesis Testing.,"While many methods for interpreting machine learning models have been proposed, they are often ad hoc, difficult to interpret, and come with limited guarantees. This is especially problematic in science and medicine, where model interpretations may be reported as discoveries or guide patient treatments. As a step toward more principled and reliable interpretations, in this paper we reframe black box model interpretability as a multiple hypothesis testing problem. The task is to discover ""important"" features by testing whether the model prediction is significantly different from what would be expected if the features were replaced with uninformative counterfactuals. We propose two testing methods: one that provably controls the false discovery rate but which is not yet feasible for large-scale applications, and an approximate testing method which can be applied to real-world data sets. In simulation, both tests have high power relative to existing interpretability methods. When applied to state-of-the-art vision and language models, the framework selects features that intuitively explain model predictions. The resulting explanations have the additional advantage that they are themselves easy to interpret.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Collin Burns"", ids = ""90909974""); list(name = ""Jesse Thomason"", ids = ""2665873""); list(name = ""W.

4eca5320e33f99226aa17925d7f2d6bdfe22a548,Identification of early molecular pathways affected by paraquat in rat lung.,"We have used global gene expression profiling, combined with pathway analysis tools, to identify in rats the molecular events associated with paraquat toxicity in the lung. Early (2, 8 and 18h) gene expression changes induced following intraperitoneal (i.p.) exposure to paraquat were measured in the caudal lobe of lungs using Affymetrix rat genome GeneChips (31,042 probe sets). A single high dose of paraquat dichloride (20mg/kg) was used that has been shown previously to cause in rats extensive lung fibrosis after 10 days. Hierarchical clustering of 543 paraquat-responsive genes (false discovery rate<0.05) revealed that under these conditions of exposure paraquat induces a staged transcriptional response in the rat lung that precedes the appearance of lung damage. We report here that many of the transcriptional responses to paraquat were rapid (being maximal at 2h post-dose), and that the predominant molecular functions and biological processes associated with these genes include membrane transport, oxidative stress, lung development, epithelial cell differentiation and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signalling. These data provide novel insights into the molecular pathways that lead to toxicity after exposure of the rat lung to paraquat.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""G. D.

9e2598783cff6d32bdb184c3230c2ead8ab96dec,Deciphering the luteal transcriptome: potential mechanisms mediating stage-specific luteolytic response of the corpus luteum to prostaglandin Fâ‚‚Î±.,"The objective of this study was to identify prostaglandin F(2Î±) (PG)-induced changes in the transcriptome of bovine corpora lutea (CL) that are specific to mature, PG-responsive (day 11) CL vs. developing (day 4) CL, which do not undergo luteolysis in response to PG administration. CL were collected at 0, 4, and 24 h after PG injection on days 4 and 11 of the estrous cycle (n = 5 per day and time point), and microarray analysis was performed with GeneChip Bovine Genome Arrays. Data normalization was performed with affy package and significance testing with maanova from Bioconductor. Significance (relative to 0 h time point) was declared at fold change >2.0 or <0.5 and false discovery rate of <5%. At 4 and 24 h after PG, 221 (day 4) and 661 (day 11) and 248 (day 4) and 1,421 (day 11) regulated genes, respectively, were identified. The accentuated gene expression response in day 11 CL was accompanied by specific enrichment of PG-regulated genes in distinctive gene ontology categories (immune related and other), particularly at 24 h after injection. Specificity in putative transcription factor binding sites was observed among PG-regulated genes on day 11 vs. day 4, including a potential association of ETS transcription factors with acute PG-induced gene expression specific to day 11 CL. Temporal and PG-induced regulation of abundance of mRNA for ETS transcription factor family members linked to the stage-specific response to PG was not observed. Increased abundance of protein and/or mRNA for six PG-regulated putative ETS-responsive genes was noted in day 11 but not day 4 CL.

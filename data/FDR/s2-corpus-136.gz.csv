0c41af6741f0ac850b76bfd8893ff6515912b9c6,On the chance accuracies of large collections of classifiers,"We provide a theoretical analysis of the chance accuracies of large collections of classifiers. We show that on problems with small numbers of examples, some classifier can perform well by random chance, and we derive a theorem to explicitly calculate this accuracy. We use this theorem to provide a principled feature selection criterion for sparse, high-dimensional problems. We evaluate this method on microarray and fMRI datasets and show that it performs very close to the optimal accuracy obtained from an oracle. We also show that on the fMRI dataset this technique chooses relevant features successfully while another state-of-the-art method, the False Discovery Rate (FDR), completely fails at standard significance levels.",2008,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Mark Palatucci"", ids = ""1752252""); list(name = ""Andrew Carlson"", ids = ""143818235"")",5f56a28ef01e874f531ba5a2dfc2d3e1e0b4862d; f7043a5fc7371fe0c0c3ea330d3f363271744085; 3d897929e413e68d6a2ae416ae7b59c6ec1341df; b31429041c8c14eab61a49cec6648dea4b963627; 903c0dc35b1ff464d1698df12b740c858dfbf8ba,9aa921b0203e06e98b49bf726a33e124f4310ea3; 5c28b24b0ecb610c6a527b32c3acb2c03b1bc184; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 65ba8fd8ef9c2a70cee99d2e5cab9302d0307a1e; bde19a3f30bbafb2495a0022b22c3a33f9213994; ca78cb7c1d841d6bde6cd54a6b50ff9157b0cd63; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 9dc134b18c06577354d50c12a8972b965d3bbacd; bb63f7e39ebef20cdc6f71596eb4309e9dbf4816; 4ed3c548dc2769f04f0d109a32b28441bef32121; d8384f7ef288d2d5cb267128471c5427fc98b54b,,,744-751
468d0e702357a717e7bb06effc460acaa55fe9ef,Multiple Influential Point Detection in High-Dimensional Spaces,"Influence diagnosis is an integrated component of data analysis, but is severely under-investigated in a high-dimensional setting. One of the key challenges, even in a fixed-dimensional setting, is how to deal with multiple influential points giving rise to the masking and swamping effects. This paper proposes a novel group deletion procedure referred to as MIP by studying two extreme statistics based on a marginal correlation based influence measure. Named the Min and Max statistics, they have complimentary properties in that the Max statistic is effective for overcoming the masking effect while the Min statistic is useful for overcoming the swamping effect. Combining their strengths, we further propose an efficient algorithm that can detect influential points with a prespecified false discovery rate. The proposed influential point detection procedure is simple to implement, efficient to run, and enjoys attractive theoretical properties. Its effectiveness is verified empirically via extensive simulation study and data analysis. An R package implementing the procedure is freely available.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Junlong Zhao"", ids = ""48019224""); list(name = ""Chao Liu"", ids = ""40430624""); list(name = ""Lu Niu"", ids = ""46937587""); list(name = ""Chenlei Leng"", ids = ""145727325"")",dd61a760fe4e2a98227f73f178e8ecbb8634a69c,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; d9802fab13b5ce5f9fb860b278bb3abac16955ad; 5f0d051ffcbde45f92daee6395883cd476777ad9; 91f5ded1564bfa2ee677699a662d9c43d6de7516; 36a0eff4ef8c322cc1eb57ee956ecd58902b28fc; 75064e4c00e051b13893fedccc130c4c5af14039; fbc993e50927db7d9afa328ad6545be5d97a7ca5; 7263fc3bdd506157d8169663c1e791996ac042cc; e5208097b88a4f0d73c28c3c669b17ed8f369c22; 3accd0b572e3267e6b2832c70ac8c4aa92064f5c; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 5b2c4084eea63062d1d81f203c3a3c0849ad2cdb; ea3962c3001218e43ae4ff368f96697b32611dde; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; 45574c2b8f3438735bf12ed003c1e524351ea8d4; b573c7cc9a69504e3fbe9ee3574dc645155080a3; b68111d2e692bbc1e5708b9d0de346e9e12577d4; 635b811fed36d98dafad025175947e2700dfdbfc; 497de05718257c700b423d8dac168b0f9db66848; 2f29f896deac1d8190f9474ac268b42eca010804,arXiv: Methodology,,

A less ideal feature of NPMLE is its step-function form. In this paper, we propose two nonparametric density estimators based on the Bernstein-type polynomials of the NPMLE. The proposed estimators have relatively simple forms and easy implementation. They have satisfactory smoothness as well as estimation efficiency. Numerical examples demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed estimators compared to existing methods.

3a1cb4ebb11a4ec4a8de1c2fa295a88561076b0b,Alterations in microRNA expression associated with alcohol consumption in rectal cancer subjects,"PurposeAlcohol consumption has been purported to influence many diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may be influenced by compounds found in alcohol. In this investigation, we test the hypothesis that total alcohol, beer, wine, and hard liquor influence miRNA expression.MethodsWe studied 1447 colorectal (CR) cancer cases with normal CR mucosa and carcinoma miRNA expression data along with alcohol consumption data. We analyzed long-term and long-term and current (LTC) alcohol use for beer, liquor, and wine with miRNA expression between paired carcinoma and normal colon and rectal tissues, adjusting for multiple comparisons using the positive false discovery rate q-value. MiRNAs associated significantly with alcohol were examined with all-cause mortality (ACM). MiRNAs associated significantly with ACM were examined with RNA-Seq data.ResultsExpression of 84 miRNAs was associated significantly with LTC wine use in normal rectal mucosa. Higher expression of two of these miRNAs significantly worsened ACM: hsa-miR-210 (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.12, 95% CI (1.03, 1.21), p-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.004), and hsa-miR-92a-1-5p (HR 1.20, 95% CI (1.04, 1.38), p-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.013). These miRNAs were downregulated across levels of LTC wine consumption.ConclusionsOur results suggest that wine influences miRNA expression in rectal cancer, supporting the hypothesis that components in alcohol influence miRNA expression.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lila E Mullany"", ids = ""6198042""); list(name = ""Jennifer S.

7ef3866571423e5a0e83a3399ee5847fd476d39b,The Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Mendelian Randomization Research Portal,"Background Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method for exploring observational associations to find evidence of causality. Objective To apply MR between multiple risk factors/phenotypic traits (exposures) and Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) in a large, unbiased manner, and to create a public resource for research. Methods We used two-sample MR in which the summary statistics relating to SNPs from genome wide association studies (GWASes) of 5,839 exposures curated on MR Base were used to assess causal relationships with PD. We selected the highest quality exposure GWASes for this report (n=401). For the disease outcome, summary statistics from the largest published PD GWAS were used. For each exposure, the causal effect on PD was assessed using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, followed by a range of sensitivity analyses. We used a false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-value of <0.05 from the IVW analysis to prioritize traits of interest. Results We observed evidence for causal associations between twelve exposures and risk of PD. Of these, nine were causal effects related to increasing adiposity and decreasing risk of PD. The remaining top exposures that affected PD risk were tea drinking, time spent watching television and forced vital capacity, but the latter two appeared to be biased by violations of underlying MR assumptions. Discussion We present a new platform which offers MR analyses for a total of 5,839 GWASes versus the largest PD GWASes available (https://pdgenetics.shinyapps.io/pdgenetics/). Alongside, we report further evidence to support a causal role for adiposity on lowering the risk of PD.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Alastair Noyce"", ids = ""6202875""); list(name = ""Sara BandrÃ©s-Ciga"", ids = ""1390074828""); list(name = ""Jonggeol Jeffrey Kim"", ids = ""49476396""); list(name = ""Karl Heilbron"", ids = ""5357514""); list(name = ""Demis A.

b41c446ec29a9b74b75da37f4d2b64694f768684,Pregnancy exposure to atmospheric pollution and meteorological conditions and placental DNA methylation.,"BACKGROUND
Air pollution exposure represents a major health threat to the developing foetus. DNA methylation is one of the most well-known molecular determinants of the epigenetic status of cells. Blood DNA methylation has been proven sensitive to air pollutants, but the molecular impact of air pollution on new-borns has so far received little attention.


OBJECTIVES
We investigated whether nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10), temperature and humidity during pregnancy are associated with differences in placental DNA methylation levels.


METHODS
Whole-genome DNA-methylation was measured using the Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in the placenta of 668 newborns from the EDEN cohort. We designed an original strategy using a priori biological information to focus on candidate genes with a specific expression pattern in placenta (active or silent) combined with an agnostic epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). We used robust linear regression to identify CpGs and differentially methylated regions (DMR) associated with each exposure during short- and long-term time-windows.


RESULTS
The candidate genes approach identified nine CpGs mapping to 9 genes associated with prenatal NO2 and PM10 exposure [false discovery rate (FDR) pâ€¯<â€¯0.05]. Among these, the methylation level of 2 CpGs located in ADORA2B remained significantly associated with NO2 exposure during the 2nd trimester and whole pregnancy in the EWAS (FDR pâ€¯<â€¯0.05). EWAS further revealed associations between the environmental exposures under study and variations of DNA methylation of 4 other CpGs. We further identified 27 DMRs significantly (FDR pâ€¯<â€¯0.05) associated with air pollutants exposure and 13 DMRs with meteorological conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
The methylation of ADORA2B, a gene whose expression was previously associated with hypoxia and pre-eclampsia, was consistently found here sensitive to atmospheric pollutants. In addition, air pollutants were associated to DMRs pointing towards genes previously implicated in preeclampsia, hypertensive and metabolic disorders. These findings demonstrate that air pollutants exposure at levels commonly experienced in the European population are associated with placental gene methylation and provide some mechanistic insight into some of the reported effects of air pollutants on preeclampsia.",2018,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""EÌ\201milie Abraham"", ids = ""50876819""); list(name = ""Sophie Rousseaux"", ids = ""4363521""); list(name = ""Lydiane Agier"", ids = ""50477938""); list(name = ""Lise Giorgis-Allemand"", ids = ""1399386793""); list(name = ""JÃ¶rg Tost"", ids = ""2063330""); list(name = ""Julien Galineau"", ids = ""3720278""); list(name = ""AgnÃ©s Hulin"", ids = ""153637527""); list(name = ""ValÃ©rie Siroux"", ids = ""4475234""); list(name = ""Daniel Vaiman"", ids = ""5195434""); list(name = ""Marie-Aline Charles"", ids = ""143899108""); list(name = ""Barbara Heude"", ids = ""4365405""); list(name = ""Anne Forhan"", ids = ""4655900""); list(name = ""Joel Schwartz"", ids = ""1972998""); list(name = ""Florent Chuffart"", ids = ""1806800""); list(name = ""Ekaterina Bourova-Flin"", ids = ""1404945798""); list(name = ""Saadi Khochbin"", ids = ""4953670""); list(name = ""RÃ©my Slama"", ids = ""34893849""); list(name = ""Johanna Lepeule"", ids = ""5213791"")",974cbb02d37abdb80a4870a88b6124126d4d19d5; 6b7db077f0b5039c590d2e37c26e8ea79b63aafb; c9fc4bf4141bfc6d4be903961908e5299c9f5f37; 6659d79a18f08ea622f38703339db2f717dae7c8; 6bf4505cfa2ef399133c993e1f96851e00f47c49; b70b488f2becb3caec26965c379a76b11fcf2ecf; f6e10bdd4d8c9dfc884d7ff45ef4d82d3834d783; c40a267244814a17c88f1364c04001c243e9c520; 6e13ed33adda5abc0fa40a6baf310a7b2a7ba73e; 50686e0c3266ef0df9ee8681a30e171d1df24c5a; fd914a838aab8fb1373b0d76443f3027347578f2; 8271832a98bb4b6aaeb2c9d0c9614ecbc8090459; e08473c9082384f3b750bd603efcbc1183d9e1a6; b820db4b8c8b895a626dc1e26fd177ac8c8c9ea2,,Environment international,118,"

ffee2458fafe66060d94767e708470d814286d5e,Identification of rare DNA variants using SRMA,"It is still challenging to identify rare functional DNA variants. Custom array-based resequencing has an advantage of processing hundreds of individuals at reasonable cost and has been used for medical sequencing studies with targeted genes. However, high false positive rate (FPR âˆ¼3%) in detection of heterozygous signals limited the application of this technology. We have previously developed novel statistical methodology for resequencing array data to largely reduce false discovery rate of single nucleotide variants (FPR< 10âˆ’5, false negative rate < 10%). We have established an analysis pipeline for Affymetrix resequencing microarray data analysis and assembled an R package named â€˜SRMAâ€™ (sequence robust multi-array analysis). The package contains five modules of quality control, data normalization, single array analysis, multi-array analysis, and output analysis. This tool allows for processing array-based sequencing data and identifying the footprint effects, insertions/deletions, and rare DNA single nucleotide variations (SNV) with high accuracy. We demonstrate the work flow of the SRMA package in this manual.",2012,,"list(name = ""Nianxiang Zhang"", ids = ""2023367""); list(name = ""Wenyi Wang"", ids = ""49337065"")",,c61bf7414278ad46459990f68100375ae4639bdb; 31385db8c610f6b8632b6af9940c1dc7371cce16; 5e46b9a7da5078b662eaab8754f71d85b687055e; f16841e022038e94a59f7e0a82002102b78d79a4; 71ee9edadec02aed109c1e9142f31ef49d5e81e2; 114e1354cee7a687ae694f7d8134c7afc87abb47; 35fa23c9f5577761ff79fd14356736570c43b68a; e43ccdaa8837f96b0b09db5b8cd993a6d4bfb161; 46c5f4f196012dc41a9b87c39d16782c3d86f374,,,

Eye movements recognized based on the EOG signal pattern are utilized to govern the HCI system and do a specific job based on the type of eye movement. With the knowledge of various related examinations, this paper intends a novel model for eye movement recognition based on EOG signals by utilizing Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) with neural network (NN). Here, the GWO is used to minimize the error function from the classifier. The performance of the proposed methodology was investigated by comparing the developed model with conventional methods. The results reveal the loftier performance of the adopted method with the error minimization analysis and recognition performance analysis in correspondence with varied performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, false-positive rate (FPR), false-negative rate (FNR), negative predictive value (NPV), false discovery rate (FDR) and the F1 score.",2019,Engineering; Medicine,"list(name = ""Harikrishna Mulam"", ids = ""27072495""); list(name = ""Malini Mudigonda"", ids = ""35393605"")",,42e27657e6f624f33dcf03351341a77cc7d9a544; f0fc458275f54ede8517c168bb19c7be71c55b6f; be20815aa5edb3831aaca98db5016cf38e0d7bea; ff14f050f1c218ed8b86a2f4289ff6ae0a27aaa7; c2373a768ec7f7c0a86220ebb53b7a3b2049b31b; cc16183182c8367215f3f2346e19dc09a6648657; 8bd6dd23b76b0803e3ee34aad1296370ecc1fb90; 150a0229022d31722e702397893b431999fd1d30; 9dedc198b4e9c1286a75a87099d084255c64bc3c; 4f6299a21fad9eba599d11bf0a81262dfbe81e14; 0980e9f6262e1839fb2fd3b61a51130b5dc85c1a; 29e42fae33fabe7ae318014ee36d82d08c5a5f57; c04a391b20840c72dec5053ef0604c20387b8ddb; a517a999c4a7710d22abb2e887a6f10975785772; b10a389935dc8bca099e3334030b8af8fb0913c0; dddfbabf14e8e3dc46c671ae39296130a1175ea5; dbb011bf2fe5808ed81c05b034a3d028e88aabad; d67ac3c65f61b44b837928e8b2f800443c885c65; 2bd3c07f66c6903e5ecc2a77a38476bca2c2c378; 695bd9bb89df717227357a4ee8d15843a11f3609; 4dc185ac2781458e73be981599bafab76d639da7; bae497bc97aa81811591d9fade76c12540a894b4; c9e4618862a17c86fbc054471f4e61b9ec78f442; 7f0efcb99a3fb15fdf76ed5f9aeab6fe9fec3cff; 7a82c500812ea4097a475ad1c102e3c1105a184c; 7ffb885203c07867704c85c5124ac97ee9e8659a; 4133358150648350b991b31f0198f1ab773fd193; 58568997bd31b6f5befb74dbbdb9100862061678; 8e003d4cc1b3c576865be86f50799a381e101abf; 25c0b0510db20a70872d53f145ac497631cc576f; d5aa679d1c8964851356d5ae3315fbe9efe25c8e; 6c2cc6c229a1828475f3a27ffaae44be7a2615bf,Biomedical Engineering / Biomedizinische Technik,65,11 - 22

To identify transcriptomic changes in type 2 diabetic islets, the Innovative Medicines Initiative for Diabetes: Improving beta-cell function and identification of diagnostic biomarkers for treatment monitoring in Diabetes (IMIDIA) consortium (www.imidia.org) established a comprehensive, unique multicentre biobank of human islets and pancreas tissues from organ donors and metabolically phenotyped pancreatectomised patients (PPP).MethodsAffymetrix microarrays were used to assess the islet transcriptome of islets isolated either by enzymatic digestion from 103 organ donors (OD), including 84 non-diabetic and 19 type 2 diabetic individuals, or by laser capture microdissection (LCM) from surgical specimens of 103 PPP, including 32 non-diabetic, 36 with type 2 diabetes, 15 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 20 with recent-onset diabetes (<1 year), conceivably secondary to the pancreatic disorder leading to surgery (type 3c diabetes). Bioinformatics tools were used to (1) compare the islet transcriptome of type 2 diabetic vs non-diabetic OD and PPP as well as vs IGT and type 3c diabetes within the PPP group; and (2) identify transcription factors driving gene co-expression modules correlated with insulin secretion ex vivo and glucose tolerance in vivo. Selected genes of interest were validated for their expression and function in beta cells.ResultsComparative transcriptomic analysis identified 19 genes differentially expressed (false discovery rate â‰¤0.05, fold change â‰¥1.5) in type 2 diabetic vs non-diabetic islets from OD and PPP. Nine out of these 19 dysregulated genes were not previously reported to be dysregulated in type 2 diabetic islets. Signature genes included TMEM37, which inhibited Ca2+-influx and insulin secretion in beta cells, and ARG2 and PPP1R1A, which promoted insulin secretion. Systems biology approaches identified HNF1A, PDX1 and REST as drivers of gene co-expression modules correlated with impaired insulin secretion or glucose tolerance, and 14 out of 19 differentially expressed type 2 diabetic islet signature genes were enriched in these modules. None of these signature genes was significantly dysregulated in islets of PPP with impaired glucose tolerance or type 3c diabetes.Conclusions/interpretationThese studies enabled the stringent definition of a novel transcriptomic signature of type 2 diabetic islets, regardless of islet source and isolation procedure. Lack of this signature in islets from PPP with IGT or type 3c diabetes indicates differences possibly due to peculiarities of these hyperglycaemic conditions and/or a role for duration and severity of hyperglycaemia.

2a8eb0c10f3410e110d01ccc13f7bf8f0be2e42a,"Microbial Communities in Sediments of Lagos Lagoon, Nigeria: Elucidation of Community Structure and Potential Impacts of Contamination by Municipal and Industrial Wastes","Estuarine sediments are significant repositories of anthropogenic contaminants, and thus knowledge of the impacts of pollution upon microbial communities in these environments is important to understand potential effects on estuaries as a whole. The Lagos lagoon (Nigeria) is one of Africa's largest estuarine ecosystems, and is impacted by hydrocarbon pollutants and other industrial and municipal wastes. The goal of this study was to elucidate microbial community structure in Lagos lagoon sediments to identify groups that may be adversely affected by pollution, and those that may serve as degraders of environmental contaminants, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Sediment samples were collected from sites that ranged in types and levels of anthropogenic impacts. The sediments were characterized for a range of physicochemical properties, and microbial community structure was determined by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes. Microbial diversity (species richness and evenness) in the Apapa and Eledu sediments was reduced compared to that of the Ofin site, and communities of both of the former two were dominated by a single operational taxonomic unit (OTU) assigned to the family Helicobacteraceae (Epsilonproteobacteria). In the Ofin community, Epsilonproteobacteria were minor constituents, while the major groups were Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, which were all minor in the Apapa and Eledu sediments. Sediment oxygen demand (SOD), a broad indicator of contamination, was identified by multivariate analyses as strongly correlated with variation in alpha diversity. Environmental variables that explained beta diversity patterns included SOD, as well as levels of naphthalene, acenaphthylene, cobalt, cadmium, total organic matter, or nitrate. Of 582 OTU identified, abundance of 167 was significantly correlated (false discovery rate qâ‰¤ 0.05) to environmental variables. The largest group of OTU correlated with PAH levels were PAH/hydrocarbon-degrading genera of the Oceanospirillales order (Gammaproteobacteria), which were most abundant in the hydrocarbon-contaminated Apapa sediment. Similar Oceanospirillales taxa are responsive to marine oil spills and thus may present a unifying theme in marine microbiology as bacteria adapted for degradation of high hydrocarbon loads, and may represent a potential means for intrinsic remediation in the case of the Lagos lagoon sediments.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chioma C.

Significant disrupted connectivities are detected by controlling the false discovery rate. Discoveries identified by the hierarchical Bayesian model are further compared with those detected by the empirical Bayes approach, and a conformity of results is established. Methodological developments are illustrated with a large data set from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE), which includes 361 subjects from 8 medical centers. We observe significantly different functional connectivities involving the Primary Auditory, Visual and Motor Cortexes in the autistic group compared to the control group. Multiple hubs of disruptions are also found to inform investigators for possible targets for interventions or development of therapeutic interventions.

DIA with SWATH generates comprehensive MS and MS/MS data throughout the entire chromatograms and all study samples. Hence, chromatograms can be extracted based on precursors or fragments which provided some benefits in terms of assay specificity in some cases. SWATH acquisition offers flexible experimental design with variable Q1 isolation windows. Liquid chromatography as well as SWATH settings were optimized to cover the lipidome of human platelets. The flexibility of the SWATH experiment design was utilized to implement target SWATH windows with narrow 5â€¯Da Q1 precursor ion selection width (multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-like SWATH windows) for the detection of low abundant oxidized phospholipids. Data processing was performed with MS-DIAL, and its feasibilities and caveats are discussed by illustrative examples. Thereby, identification of lipids is still a bottleneck in non-targeted lipidomics workflow. MS-DIAL, however, offers automatic identification via spectral matching using an in silico library. In total 1971 molecular features were detected cross the samples of which 611 were identified (total score >70%). The quality of the acquired data was validated with embedded quality control samples (nâ€¯=â€¯11). 80.3% of all features detected in the QC samples showed a coefficient of variation of below 30%. Multivariate statistics were used to visualize differences in the lipidome of distinct sample groups at a false discovery rate of 5%.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""JÃ¶rg Schlotterbeck"", ids = ""32337016""); list(name = ""Madhumita Chatterjee"", ids = ""2112112""); list(name = ""Meinrad Gawaz"", ids = ""47806830""); list(name = ""Michael LÃ¤mmerhofer"", ids = ""4941689"")",cdff86cce543f075963f1ec7070a55dc3f91820a,,Analytica chimica acta,1046,"

4be22f04382f177b992adedc54fa79ef685ee35d,MDR1 gene polymorphisms are associated with ulcerative colitis in a cohort of Serbian patients with inflammatory bowel disease,"BACKGROUND
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease of unknown etiology in which genetic factors contribute to development of disease. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene encoding transporter P-glycoprotein have been associated with IBD, but their role in disease susceptibility remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of three MDR1 polymorphisms, C1236T (rs1128503), G2677T/A (rs2032582) and C3435T (rs1045642), with Serbian IBD patients.


METHODS
A total of 206 IBD patients, 107 Crohn's disease (CD) and 99 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 255 healthy controls were included in the study. All subjects were genotyped using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. Comparisons between the groups were performed using the Pearson Chi-square test. False discovery rate according to Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
Carriers of T allele of all three MDR1 SNPs were more common in UC patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting predisposing role of T allele of these SNPs in UC pathogenesis. Consistently, TT genotype of C1236T and TTT haplotype were also found more frequently in UC patients. On the other hand, C allele and CC genotype of C1236T and C3435T, as well as G allele and GG genotype of G2677T/A were more frequent in healthy subjects, implying protective role of these variants in UC. Likewise, CGC haplotype and CGC/CGC diplotype were more frequent in controls. Contrary to UC, no statistical difference was observed between CD patients and controls in any of the SNPs analyzed.


CONCLUSION
MDR1 gene variants and haplotypes were associated with UC in Serbian IBD patients, further supporting their potential role in susceptibility to UC.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dragana D.

0724d5e0fff354fd3dca9936a2b4c0ea209b20b1,Changes in brain morphology in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea.,"BACKGROUND
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common disease that leads to daytime sleepiness and cognitive impairment. Attempts to investigate changes in brain morphology that may underlie these impairments have led to conflicting conclusions. This study was undertaken to aim to resolve this confusion, and determine whether OSA is associated with changes in brain morphology in a large group of patients with OSA, using improved voxel-based morphometry analysis, an automated unbiased method of detecting local changes in brain structure.


METHODS
60 patients with OSA (mean apnoea hypopnoea index 55 (95% CI 48 to 62) events/h, 3 women) and 60 non-apnoeic controls (mean apnoea hypopnoea index 4 (95% CI 3 to 5) events/h, 5 women) were studied. Subjects were imaged using T1-weighted 3-D structural MRI (69 subjects at 1.5 T, 51 subjects at 3 T). Differences in grey matter were investigated in the two groups, controlling for age, sex, site and intracranial volume. Dedicated cerebellar analysis was performed on a subset of 108 scans using a spatially unbiased infratentorial template.


RESULTS
Patients with OSA had a reduction in grey matter volume in the right middle temporal gyrus compared with non-apnoeic controls (p<0.05, corrected for topological false discovery rate across the entire brain). A reduction in grey matter was also seen within the cerebellum, maximal in the left lobe VIIIb close to XI, extending across the midline into the right lobe.


CONCLUSION
These data show that OSA is associated with focal loss of grey matter that could contribute to cognitive decline. Specifically, lesions in the cerebellum may result in both motor dysfunction and working memory deficits, with downstream negative consequences on tasks such as driving.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mary J.

Affymetrix SNP arrays, which are widely used for CNV studies, significantly depend on accurate copy number (CN) estimation. Nevertheless, CN estimation may be biased by several factors, including cross-hybridization and training sample batch, as well as genomic waves of intensities induced by sequence-dependent hybridization rate and amplification efficiency. Since many available algorithms only address one or two of the three factors, a high false discovery rate (FDR) often results when identifying CNV. Therefore, we have developed a new CNV detection pipeline which is based on hybridization and amplification rate correction (CNVhac).MethodsCNVhac first estimates the allelic concentrations (ACs) of target sequences by using the sample independent parameters trained through physicochemical hybridization law. Then the raw CN is estimated by taking the ratio of AC to the corresponding average AC from a reference sample set for one specific site. Finally, a hidden Markov model (HMM) segmentation process is implemented to detect CNV regions.ResultsBased on public HapMap data, the results show that CNVhac effectively smoothes the genomic waves and facilitates more accurate raw CN estimates compared to other methods. Moreover, CNVhac alleviates, to a certain extent, the sample dependence of inference and makes CNV calling with appreciable low FDRs.ConclusionCNVhac is an effective approach to address the common difficulties in SNP array analysis, and the working principles of CNVhac can be easily extended to other platforms.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Quan Wang"", ids = ""47598827""); list(name = ""Peichao Peng"", ids = ""38401610""); list(name = ""Minping Qian"", ids = ""144655405""); list(name = ""Lin Wan"", ids = ""144363231""); list(name = ""Minghua Deng"", ids = ""1709706"")",533ea012d9f8e3417a1185cbe39a306e035d98e7; 2971ff4c11d5ab8be8f04d5a1343d2134750de36; 6f17a95561ca0e0210c4294b892bdf349b161d0c; 8d506b1e306476bbd6d055f559f8a91635bbff80,b95c8bdf18e34ee2c96df0129f8abdd5134299b5; b11498a05f9fac15c24dc33215c886bb7b35d75f; d48123326b2a0ef2b05c473c82e6e91f05a2e175; bf32b023bfbb7a37af6628b6b85a74c2d5dd97f1; 8f4142a8358e554fe3a8279acf75556d737ba8a5; 4dd42112bf3ec0e6ae0563499903a3f2bdc9a1a0; 961fef95d5f28e39d315fed51c2d5db8b8b25941; 8e8a20980b1570cb488a73bc37f31823fcd79b0f; adcbfb014c154fb257bf702850cdeb37b0ac66e5; e6cbfde812b630bb52b50292404029b1d2b4b3ef; 4101ff7a7e52216aaebf8d7828639b4a83be7a81; 58325327c417f7836bc1d44e9647a58cc95fb185; ecf023b4341e6fa243bfc4ba50532c8f77319b2d; 5ac5bf942947c6ec74eb3b98b716de252cf22da1; 102b64c99d826109b53f71c7f61f8717b02d90e7; 30da597448f22358fc53ff6ac831410899adeb1d; e462182080b96336bf55801d393549391e94735c; 8fe2ea0a67954f1380b3387e3262f1cdb9f9b3e5; 582a2b7ff90c3cb7a1a02ac698462a7ed443c5a4; 36b40e07dbd0fd44e16328154469011b8c1f8b0f; 05a612245405257d564c356ab9b0617ac0f53c8f; 5970218e7abbf8965e547acfaa95441d0bd0b565; 24022c31a448ee8cee610c5686fb7883c3efb060; 2fffc4d5e4d764ff5db2503c4b2e3222faffdd65; 415b08a187702717e0b8bc20e4f0266d3da6672c; 000551662c3902ed66709be879053d95dafc0211; 6e6da621f0200daa484c5b6ada9e3debf1c369af; a70a05dc860131ee8c3aea8ef220651de00c0803; 22557421fba8b3e9878a9c6ec56205b5c0803079; d6492dec020f082c9e1200242401d8d9d12ae5f0; 427eaafcd47b3abc620b953ff021f25925ff0e62; f688d5308963e72270f0e36f77efe64ba99c30d7; 14f78e30fd63cab6dd5af4c94d9379b6d297118a; 3bd835e6110f3c00ad9c35efa406ccaffa9c6483; 7b27a91e8bca7fc900c5b2b8365c819530c87000; 49409df130f420165422e5ba0798d31e76e9a870; afa8fe1a6d2dea2769486b87ac571d528fa1e73a; b3b4871e5c4b4e04f371ab6c6563c4c6b6ad379b; 4f6306d6ef36c9fb079a045c20c467c52a351aeb; d68bb77f29ce1b19e13166f16c81e3841f03d8db; df6d93d37dcfa54d1fa9f9cca4a8b0b1f827eca7; 533ea012d9f8e3417a1185cbe39a306e035d98e7; 9d3a22b070de6352d428b4b820502ce1fff3ce3a; dc7032ebfeff2ca816240e1d73e3ad1726c935db; 86c4e00c7dcf76cd80938f872fe1c9d40dd2da1b; 0ce53cf2bb1ef3f307cd08bffec14d792e553370; 0712642a045f7efaded177961b481ddd5af9b934; 00df2c7f58e1f5e7651b383c0f3e1370fbf306c6; 28664acb1f054a87170e6d2417c2ba3d0649f351; d6192e1949844607c9450818abd09c5212464880; 6bf0cd7cdeabedd5093bc4956fabd9be9717eabc; f27200e013b6d0c42d7b84dcdadcf0f23bbc1a12; c1d348bf0b1fcbbf85cb1869075fcbf5c32cb745,BMC Medical Genomics,5,24 - 24
f6fc73da141325113c95e29e05b9be7872dbbe18,A nutrient-wide association study on blood pressure.,"BACKGROUND
A nutrient-wide approach may be useful to comprehensively test and validate associations between nutrients (derived from foods and supplements) and blood pressure (BP) in an unbiased manner.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Data from 4680 participants aged 40 to 59 years in the cross-sectional International Study of Macro/Micronutrients and Blood Pressure (INTERMAP) were stratified randomly into training and testing sets. US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) four cross-sectional cohorts (1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-2004, 2005-2006) were used for external validation. We performed multiple linear regression analyses associating each of 82 nutrients and 3 urine electrolytes with systolic and diastolic BP in the INTERMAP training set. Significant findings were validated in the INTERMAP testing set and further in the NHANES cohorts (false discovery rate <5% in training, P<0.05 for internal and external validation). Among the validated nutrients, alcohol and urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio were directly associated with systolic BP, and dietary phosphorus, magnesium, iron, thiamin, folacin, and riboflavin were inversely associated with systolic BP. In addition, dietary folacin and riboflavin were inversely associated with diastolic BP. The absolute effect sizes in the validation data (NHANES) ranged from 0.97 mm Hg lower systolic BP (phosphorus) to 0.39 mm Hg lower systolic BP (thiamin) per 1-SD difference in nutrient variable. Inclusion of nutrient intake from supplements in addition to foods gave similar results for some nutrients, though it attenuated the associations of folacin, thiamin, and riboflavin intake with BP.


CONCLUSIONS
We identified significant inverse associations between B vitamins and BP, relationships hitherto poorly investigated. Our analyses represent a systematic unbiased approach to the evaluation and validation of nutrient-BP associations.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ioanna Tzoulaki"", ids = ""145781843""); list(name = ""Chirag J.

Detection depends on experimental design, lab platforms, parameters and analysis algorithms. However, NGS-based somatic mutation detection is prone to erroneous calls, with reported validation rates near 54% and congruence between algorithms less than 50%. Here, we developed an algorithm to assign a single statistic, a false discovery rate (FDR), to each somatic mutation identified by NGS. This FDR confidence value accurately discriminates true mutations from erroneous calls. Using sequencing data generated from triplicate exome profiling of C57BL/6 mice and B16-F10 melanoma cells, we used the existing algorithms GATK, SAMtools and SomaticSNiPer to identify somatic mutations. For each identified mutation, our algorithm assigned an FDR. We selected 139 mutations for validation, including 50 somatic mutations assigned a low FDR (high confidence) and 44 mutations assigned a high FDR (low confidence). All of the high confidence somatic mutations validated (50 of 50), none of the 44 low confidence somatic mutations validated, and 15 of 45 mutations with an intermediate FDR validated. Furthermore, the assignment of a single FDR to individual mutations enables statistical comparisons of lab and computation methodologies, including ROC curves and AUC metrics. Using the HiSeq 2000, single end 50 nt reads from replicates generate the highest confidence somatic mutation call set.",2012,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Martin LÃ¶wer"", ids = ""3276622""); list(name = ""Bernhard Y.

The model serves us to address the multiple testing problem in the presence of many group or cluster effects. This is carried out through a specialized Bayesian false discovery rate procedure. The likelihood is simplified by an approximation based on Laplace's approximation for integrals and a trace approximation for the determinants. The posterior marginals are estimated using this approximated likelihood. In particular, we obtain credible regions for the parameters, as well as probability estimates for the difference between risks (Poisson intensities) associated with different groups or clusters, or different levels of the fixed effects.

b28601fcf04a44a22722ce530161d87f3ec8655c,Efficient Two-Stage Genome-Wide Association Designs Based on False Positive Report Probabilities,"Despite recent advances, very-high-throughput (VHT) technologies capable of genotyping hundreds of thousands of SNPs in individual samples remain prohibitively expensive for the large studies necessary to screen substantial sections of the genome for variants with modest effects on disease risk. This paper presents a two-stage strategy, where a portion of available samples are genotyped with VHT technology, and a small number of the most promising variants are genotyped with standard high-throughput techniques in the remaining samples as an independent replication study. The sample sizes in the first and second stages and the corresponding significance levels are chosen to limit False Positive Report Probability (FPRP), while maximizing the number of Expected True Positives (ETPs). (The FPRP is the conditional probability that a marker is not truly associated with disease, given the a significant test for disease-marker association.) For a fixed budget, the two-stage strategy has greater power (a larger number of ETPs) than the single-stage strategy (where all subjects are genotyped using expensive VHT technology). Furthermore, concentrating on the FPRP leads to considerable savings relative to strategies designed to control the family-wise error (e.g. Bonferonni correction). The FPRP and number of ETPs can also accommodate researchers' prior beliefs about the number of causal loci and the magnitude of their effects. The expected number of false positives does not change if the true number and effects of causal loci differs from the specified prior (although the false discovery rate will vary), thus limiting the absolute amount of resources spent chasing ""false leads.""",2006,Computer Science; Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Peter Kraft"", ids = ""143832374"")",12e2d9c94bffe840cee77b17aecc9247a0b8ffa5; 5cea3127ca1124cb22b11b1585df4c686997f6ee; 514c6b06a96623eb3c75c42c5ee0cf5c5ba0d4de; 9ff2c673eea46393a79aaf9445d556df1f9aeb15; f285aebe92d5d881b4b3f3855c01481452016dad; 4031c328b5559b24f94dd03c9ada21d09920fd91; 8e35f1bce2279e3d16e6b0af047c5a119b6903bd; 96299bab9b0d52dd0a9f80c11b73f0b24ba1bf03; 9a573736c35db3c1b595af21f022998b76b1fa3e; 6409a75766a2ae809c17823c91abaf58cc09292b; 9ad58f245db7ec4d3da6267033dcadfab1489bbf; 85a0abe3699f70ca687b8a46a4e22239bad31d37; dc562be126fa5b0447fd583e95865ce3bfc2693e; afb77d5b9a50c3a50a0bb413e9fc8ea4c8cb3220; 72e70c5344fee9f099506f6bd9c478a1fcd6435a; 177951df0f6223d05a50fbec605d6c71bfd14e01; ce6e06311f7b86fedb6b9adc54df7dd8371e0d60; 7dd559fc7a2d83cb688107e64dc6e92afc2d42dc,,Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

fa8f00421716829aece9ad4cd6e914c303361617,Sex Differences in Genetic Associations With Longevity,"IMPORTANCE
Sex differences in genetic associations with human longevity remain largely unknown; investigations on this topic are important for individualized health care.


OBJECTIVE
To explore sex differences in genetic associations with longevity.


DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS
This population-based case-control study used sex-specific genome-wide association study and polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses to examine sex differences in genetic associations with longevity. Five hundred sixty-four male and 1614 female participants older than 100 years were compared with a control group of 773 male and 1526 female individuals aged 40 to 64 years. All were Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study participants with Han ethnicity who were recruited in 1998 and 2008 to 2014.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Sex-specific loci and pathways associated with longevity and PRS measures of joint effects of sex-specific loci.


RESULTS
Eleven male-specific and 11 female-specific longevity loci (P < 10-5) and 35 male-specific and 25 female-specific longevity loci (10-5 â‰¤ P < 10-4) were identified. Each of these loci's associations with longevity were replicated in north and south regions of China in one sex but were not significant in the other sex (P = .13-.97), and loci-sex interaction effects were significant (P < .05). The associations of loci rs60210535 of the LINC00871 gene with longevity were replicated in Chinese women (P = 9.0 Ã— 10-5) and US women (P = 4.6 Ã— 10-5) but not significant in Chinese and US men. The associations of the loci rs2622624 of the ABCG2 gene were replicated in Chinese women (P = 6.8 Ã— 10-5) and European women (P = .003) but not significant in both Chinese and European men. Eleven male-specific pathways (inflammation and immunity genes) and 34 female-specific pathways (tryptophan metabolism and PGC-1Î± induced) were significantly associated with longevity (P < .005; false discovery rate < 0.05). The PRS analyses demonstrated that sex-specific associations with longevity of the 4 exclusive groups of 11 male-specific and 11 female-specific loci (P < 10-5) and 35 male-specific and 25 female-specific loci (10-5 â‰¤P < 10-4) were jointly replicated across north and south discovery and target samples. Analyses using the combined data set of north and south showed that these 4 groups of sex-specific loci were jointly and significantly associated with longevity in one sex (P = 2.9 Ã— 10-70 to 1.3 Ã— 10-39) but not jointly significant in the other sex (P = .11 to .70), while interaction effects between PRS and sex were significant (P = 4.8 Ã— 10-50 to 1.2 Ã— 10-16).


CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE
The sex differences in genetic associations with longevity are remarkable, but have been overlooked by previously published genome-wide association studies on longevity. This study contributes to filling this research gap and provides a scientific basis for further investigating effects of sex-specific genetic variants and their interactions with environment on healthy aging, which may substantially contribute to more effective and targeted individualized health care for male and female elderly individuals.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yi Zeng"", ids = ""144492744""); list(name = ""Chao Nie"", ids = ""35864916""); list(name = ""Junxia Min"", ids = ""48445735""); list(name = ""Huashuai Chen"", ids = ""46254822""); list(name = ""Xiaomin Liu"", ids = ""46522651""); list(name = ""Rui Ye"", ids = ""47466129""); list(name = ""Zhihua Chen"", ids = ""1410170478""); list(name = ""Chen Bai"", ids = ""46567493""); list(name = ""Enjun Xie"", ids = ""35037307""); list(name = ""Zhaoxue Yin"", ids = ""65866941""); list(name = ""Yuebin Lv"", ids = ""13742022""); list(name = ""Jiehua Lu"", ids = ""5623489""); list(name = ""Jianxin Li"", ids = ""47785906""); list(name = ""Ting Ni"", ids = ""2952927""); list(name = ""L.

After the gene expression is measured, investigators may try to identify these genes for which there is differential expression across groups. Controlling the overall Type I error (Î±) is an important issue in the multiple hypotheses testing. The family-wise error rate (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR) are commonly used to difne the overall Type I error. Benjamini & Hochberg (1995) developed a FDR controlling procudure (BH procedure). However, when the number of true alternative hypotheses increse, the BH procedure becomes very conservative. Therefore, Benjamini & Hochberg (2000) proposed an adaptive FDR controlling procedure (Adaptive BH procedure) that incorporates the proportion of ture null hypotheses (Ï€0) and the procedure is shown to have ability in controlling error. Nevertheless, Ï€0 is unknown. Hence, how to estimate Ï€0 is the pivotal issue. Allison et al. (2002) proposed using the mixture beta model to model the corresponding p values from the multiple hypotheses. Under the null hypothesis, the distribution of p values is uniform on the interval [0,1]. On the contrary, under the alternative hypothesis, the distribution of p values can be modeled as a mixture of V separate component beta distributions. Allison et al. (2002) model the p-values with a uniform distribution plus a beta distribution in there simulations. However, when the correlation between gene expression levels increases, the corresponding p values from the null hypotheses tend to cluster closer to one than to zero. That causes the improper use of the uniform distribution. This thesis suggests replacing the uniform distribution by a regular beta distribution in the mixed beta model. Monte Carlo simulations show that the model without uniform distribution has more robust and accurate performance in highly correlated situations. The estimation method proposed by Benjamini & Hochberg (2000) is also compared.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""æž—è‚²è\210\210"", ids = ""79854385"")",,,,,1-43
1b5491fd5a81646c9eb5f09fda29d7fb7a705533,Multiple sclerosis: changes in microarchitecture of white matter tracts after training with a video game balance board.,"PURPOSE
To determine if high-intensity, task-oriented, visual feedback training with a video game balance board (Nintendo Wii) induces significant changes in diffusion-tensor imaging ( DTI diffusion-tensor imaging ) parameters of cerebellar connections and other supratentorial associative bundles and if these changes are related to clinical improvement in patients with multiple sclerosis.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The protocol was approved by local ethical committee; each participant provided written informed consent. In this 24-week, randomized, two-period crossover pilot study, 27 patients underwent static posturography and brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at study entry, after the first 12-week period, and at study termination. Thirteen patients started a 12-week training program followed by a 12-week period without any intervention, while 14 patients received the intervention in reverse order. Fifteen healthy subjects also underwent MR imaging once and underwent static posturography. Virtual dissection of white matter tracts was performed with streamline tractography; values of DTI diffusion-tensor imaging parameters were then obtained for each dissected tract. Repeated measures analyses of variance were performed to evaluate whether DTI diffusion-tensor imaging parameters significantly changed after intervention, with false discovery rate correction for multiple hypothesis testing.


RESULTS
There were relevant differences between patients and healthy control subjects in postural sway and DTI diffusion-tensor imaging parameters (P < .05). Significant main effects of time by group interaction for fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity of the left and right superior cerebellar peduncles were found (F2,23 range, 5.555-3.450; P = .036-.088 after false discovery rate correction). These changes correlated with objective measures of balance improvement detected at static posturography (r = -0.381 to 0.401, P < .05). However, both clinical and DTI diffusion-tensor imaging changes did not persist beyond 12 weeks after training.


CONCLUSION
Despite the low statistical power (35%) due to the small sample size, the results showed that training with the balance board system modified the microstructure of superior cerebellar peduncles. The clinical improvement observed after training might be mediated by enhanced myelination-related processes, suggesting that high-intensity, task-oriented exercises could induce favorable microstructural changes in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Luca Prosperini"", ids = ""5585676""); list(name = ""Fulvia Fanelli"", ids = ""39329511""); list(name = ""Nikolaos Petsas"", ids = ""6787836""); list(name = ""E.

4ab2a01faac9491f3e61bcc78e255812078a61f3,Interaction Between AGTR1 and PPARÎ³ Gene Polymorphisms on the Risk of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.,"AIMS
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an important public health issue worldwide. Several recent studies have reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ (PPARÎ³) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1) variants are associated with NAFLD occurrence, but the results have been inconsistent. The aim of this study was to analyze the interactions between PPARÎ³ and AGTR1 polymorphisms and their associations with NAFLD in Chinese adults.


METHODS
Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the PPARÎ³ gene and 5 SNPs of the AGTR1 gene were selected and genotyped in 1591 unrelated Chinese adults. The SNPAssoc package of R was used to examine the relationships between the selected SNPs and NAFLD.


RESULTS
After adjusting the covariance, the results from the overdominant model showed that participants carrying the T/C genotype of rs2638360 in AGTR1 have a decreased risk of NAFLD compared with those with T/T-C/C genotypes (odds ratio: 0.70, 95% confidence interval: 0.49-1.00). However, our results showed that none of the selected PPARÎ³ variants were significantly associated with the risk of NAFLD after applying a false discovery rate correction. Among the 12 selected SNPs from PPARÎ³ and AGTR1, model-based multifactor dimensionality reduction (MB-MDR) analyses for gene-gene interactions revealed that all the models were significantly associated with the increased risk of NAFLD (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) except the 2-, 10-, 11-, and 12-locus models. Further, among the 10 SNPs negatively associated with NAFLD, the four-locus model (rs13431696 and rs3856806 in PPARÎ³, and rs5182, rs1492100 in ATGR1) and the five-locus model (rs9817428, rs1175543, rs13433696, and rs2920502 in PPARÎ³, and rs1492100 in ATGR1) were closely related with NAFLD susceptibility (pâ€‰=â€‰0.019 and pâ€‰=â€‰0.048, respectively).


CONCLUSION
Our present study suggests that interactions among multiple AGTR1 and PPARÎ³ polymorphisms are associated with the risk of NAFLD in the Chinese population.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Peifu Zhu"", ids = ""24980959""); list(name = ""Honghong Lu"", ids = ""81970301""); list(name = ""Yang Jing"", ids = ""1779037""); list(name = ""Hui Zhou"", ids = ""46544514""); list(name = ""Yi Ding"", ids = ""143769931""); list(name = ""Jie Wang"", ids = ""49605135""); list(name = ""Daoxia Guo"", ids = ""4128829""); list(name = ""Zhirong Guo"", ids = ""49694554""); list(name = ""Chen Dong"", ids = ""143896280"")",,,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,23 3,"

83a7f9e2089941f810c896228cee7623562b2f9f,Erratum: sample size determination for the false discovery rate,"We have made corrections to the routines that were provided to implement Pounds and Cheng (2005) method to determine the sample size for a microarray experiment that uses the false discovery rate as the ultimate measure of statistical significance. Some routines in the original R and S-plus libraries did not properly account for differences between the definition of the noncentrality parameter in Equations (18) and (19) of Pounds and Cheng (2005) and the definition of the non-centrality parameter used by the internal R or S-plus function to evaluate the cumulative distribution function of the non-central F-distribution. A corrected version of the R routine library is now available for download from www.stjuderesearch.org/depts/biostats/fdrsampsize/index.html. To avoid confusion, all routines in the revised library use the definition of Equations (18) and (19) of Pounds and Cheng (2005). For a variety of settings involving a single two-sided test, the accuracy of the revised routine library has been checked by comparing the results of the avepow.oneway routine to the results of proc power in SAS and the built-in R function power.anova.test (Appendix). Corrected results of the simulation studies of Pounds and Cheng (2005) are reported in Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 1. Table 1 gives the simulation estimate of the expected value (EV) of the average power, i.e. the EV of the ratio D of the number of true discoveries to the number of false null hypotheses when sample size is determined using the true values of the proportion Ï€ of null hypotheses that are true and the effect size Î· of the false null hypotheses. The SD of D observed over 1000 simulation replications is also reported. In all but two settings, the determined sample size gives an estimate of the average power that is greater than or equal to the desired average power Î´. In two settings, the simulation estimate of average power is slightly less than the desired average power. Table 2 reports the corrected results of a series of simulations that generated F-statistics for a background study with per-group sample size 4 from the assumed setting. The background F-statistics, instead of the actual effect size parameters, were used to determine sample with the method of Pounds and Cheng (2005).

The study was conducted as a prospective caseâ€“control study in a medical center in southern Taiwan. The patient group consisted of 145 male patients with smoking-related COPD and a control group of 139 resistant smokers from July 2004 to September 2009. We compared allele and genotype frequencies of three tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the TNF-Î± gene promoter region at âˆ’308, âˆ’863, and âˆ’1031 in all subjects. We also analyzed the influence of each genetic variant on pulmonary function parameters, body mass index (BMI), serum TNF-Î± levels, and outcomes among heavy smokers with or without COPD. COPD patients had a significantly lower A allele frequency (9.7 vs. 15.1%, ORÂ =Â 0.6, pÂ =Â 0.048, false discovery rate qÂ =Â 0.144) and a significantly lower A carrier genotype frequency (19.3 vs. 30.2%, ORÂ =Â 0.52, pÂ =Â 0.042, qÂ =Â 0.135) than resistant smokers. The âˆ’863 CA genotype was associated with a better FEV1/FVC ratio (79 vs. 71.5%, pÂ =Â 0.034), and higher BMI (24.9 vs. 23.6Â kg/m2, pÂ =Â 0.048). In addition, COPD patients with the âˆ’1031 C carrier genotype had higher serum TNF-Î± levels (20.9 vs. 16.2Â pg/ml, pÂ =Â 0.01). BMI (hazard ratioÂ =Â 0.84, 95% CIÂ =Â 0.74â€“0.96, pÂ =Â 0.008) was the only independent predictor for mortality.

49c3e7aedcff30130a7b5de481319e5510141602,Plasma sphingolipids in HIV-associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"INTRODUCTION
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant cause of morbidity in persons living with HIV (PLWH) and HIV appears to uniquely cause COPD, independent of smoking. The mechanisms by which HIV leads to COPD are not clear. The objective of this study was to identify metabolomic biomarkers and potential mechanistic pathways of HIV-associated COPD (HIV-COPD).


METHODS
We performed case-control metabolite profiling via mass spectrometry in plasma from 38 individuals with HIV-COPD (cases), comparing to matched controls with/without HIV and with/without COPD. Untargeted metabolites of interest were identified with liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/mass spectrometry (MS)), and targeted metabolomics for tryptophan (Trp) and kynurenine (Kyn) were measured by selective reaction monitoring (SRM) with LC-MS/MS. We used mixed-effects models to compare metabolite concentrations in cases compared with controls while controlling for relevant biological variables.


RESULTS
We identified 1689 analytes associated with HIV-COPD at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 10%. In PLWH, we identified 263 analytes (10% FDR) between those with and without COPD. LC MS/MS identified Trp and 17 lipids, including sphingolipids and diacylglycerol. After adjusting for relevant covariates, the Kyn/Trp ratio measured by SRM was significantly higher in PLWH (p=0.022), but was not associated with COPD status (p=0.95).


CONCLUSIONS
There is a unique metabolite profile in HIV-COPD that includes sphingolipids. Trp metabolism is increased in HIV, but does not appear to independently contribute to HIV-COPD.

The probabilistic assessment about the set of possible trajectories that the variable may follow over time is summarized by the simultaneous confidence region generated from its forecast generating distribution. However, if the null model is only approximative or altogether unavailable, one cannot derive analytic expressions for this confidence region, and its non-parametric estimation is impractical given commonly available predictive sample sizes. Instead, this paper derives the approximate rectangular confidence regions that control false discovery rate error, which are a function of the predictive sample covariance matrix and the empirical distribution of the Mahalanobis distance of the path-forecast errors. These rectangular regions are simple to construct and appear to work well in a variety of cases explored empirically and by simulation. The proposed techniques are applied to provide confidence bands around the Fed and Bank of England real-time path-forecasts of growth and inflation.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ã’scar JordÃ "", ids = ""69854972""); list(name = ""Malte KnÃ¼ppel"", ids = ""46223106""); list(name = ""Massimiliano Marcellino"", ids = ""1855261"")",8d9aa48904e60a4bff7a94435d42ae72e1fd90f3; d3c08079bbfe16bbe19148c72fe0b19124dbec9f; 642a83d0942b3ef1aaef6d0ebddb7c3e9d00d4d1; 12813c2c3f72e84f7f94f6623e1b254631550a19; cac8950e3caf686d58a09ac4f018adb318b4af22; e22d267edbef07634ce6ae930ecdb3640ba8c4bd; 5cb1f32f409901635aa9bbcd32309b51d6e5feb8; 98773a337bebf32cd480d8c78cbdc30dec2bcf42; 35ec2cf1fcd7f584379fe3d63d1c5ec94d41f5de; e367d94f25ce190b3559028b70e1dc3d7c1e970f; e5ff7500d45e288a261781e4af2a475e6a42a218,11f0716e44f3b5c983cff84acbbac762b5a9466f; 18509452e7d4455ed4be63612c7d9a2de444a8c0; 0a8a4247d6546b49e964c8d20783180940d1c39e; 3d4eaf434506fe0728f538927d859214004930cb; ee0c9602c838879ef77d5fedbe3e870fd7f07d00; 87787d2f0a373c745544c8d1bede6f88c3d69262; 389c5016c5bc7a16df1de93a6fef2d12de3b4e5c; 03077fa113d8c3bb7bf818d73d439cc94b5cab4e; 7302febdec049235971895db54aef77e7624dc3e; 3727abc784d9d72016d4aba1c25e9c98cf6c1c5a; 24f3e29d9feab95e78f3f47364c4edbae34adfd2; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4a67426d7041aea781115423ce7722fc3fc52089; 13a33954e08c3973a6f2362185a47ca997a78992; 0bd2de0f430bee53bc18be84b2b5e0c47b149ba3; 398092720fb3d0c22e0e20a99c480962f15a30c7; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 7db3b97090de2f978602089d9611988b844a93ea; 0c23fcc92e87c71d28209a639c21bf80dd6fa4c8; 943e5982a309e5c48f40304fcef087c68b1e6c58; 70ef75d9aca90d949ff4ba25bb0fc54e80db0bbb; 4a3d6918aa76a5d772fb80e98c371630dd1fb610; f49ba4c077809221aee01a861c7cb0280176f792; c831d142e57b83a0ddd75955b03822767d23d1cf; 94726fa607fcec59ef4344e99a324e4e5f8dba16; a724caea6819c848e32cdf5b5da1f0351f2e4637; 9c7458e29e9f56f52a52253714e38cabe3d82b5e,,,

Adjusted random coefficient models were used to analyze the relationship between SNPS and obesity phenotypes. False discovery rate q-values were calculated to account for multiple testing. Significance of the associations was defined as a q-value â©½0.20.Results:Two SNPs (in NR1H4 and SMARCA2 in women only) were significantly associated with both BMI and waist circumference. In addition, two SNPs (in SIRT1 and SCAP in women only) were associated with BMI alone. A functional SNP, in IL6, was strongly associated with waist.Conclusion:In this explorative study among participants of a large population-based cohort, five SNPs, mainly located in transcription mediator genes, were strongly associated with obesity phenotypes. The results from whole genome and candidate gene studies support the potential role of NR1H4, SIRT1, SMARCA2 and IL6 in obesity. Although replication of our findings and further research on the functionality of these SNPs and underlying mechanism is necessary, our data indirectly suggest a role of GATA transcription factors in weight control.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""S W van den Berg"", ids = ""46764696""); list(name = ""Martijn E.

0aa80cafe91bbbe45bc30abb1b9073d8a0eaeb87,Gene expressionâ€based classifications of fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumours of the breast,"Fibroepithelial tumors (FTs) of the breast are a heterogeneous group of lesions ranging from fibroadenomas (FAD) to phyllodes tumors (PT) (benign, borderline, malignant). Further understanding of their molecular features and classification might be of clinical value. In this study, we analysed the expression of 105 breast cancer-related genes, including the 50 genes of the PAM50 intrinsic subtype predictor and 12 genes of the Claudin-low subtype predictor, in a panel of 75 FTs (34 FADs, 5 juvenile FADs, 20 benign PTs, 5 borderline PTs and 11 malignant PTs) with clinical follow-up. In addition, we compared the expression profiles of FTs with those of 14 normal breast tissues and 49 primary invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs). Our results revealed that the levels of expression of all breast cancer-related genes can discriminate the various groups of FTs, together with normal breast tissues and IDCs (False Discovery Rate < 5%). Among FTs, the levels expression of proliferation-related genes (e.g. CCNB1 and MKI67) and mesenchymal/epithelial-related (e.g. CLDN3 and EPCAM) genes were found to be most discriminative. As expected, FADs showed the highest and lowest expression of epithelial- and proliferation-related genes, respectively, whereas malignant PTs showed the opposite expression pattern. Interestingly, the overall profile of benign PTs was found more similar to FADs and normal breast tissues than the rest of tumours, including juvenile FADs. Within the dataset of IDCs and normal breast tissues, the vast majority of FADs, juvenile FADs, benign PTs and borderline PTs were identified as Normal-like by intrinsic breast cancer subtyping, whereas 7 (63.6%) and 3 (27.3%) malignant PTs were identified as Claudin-low and Basal-like, respectively. Finally, we observed that the previously described PAM50 risk of relapse prognostic score better predicted outcome in FTs than the morphological classification, even within PTs-only. Our results suggest that classification of FTs using gene expression-based data is feasible and might provide clinically useful biological and prognostic information.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Maria Nieves Calvo Vidal"", ids = ""91449346""); list(name = ""Vicente Peg"", ids = ""4020074""); list(name = ""Patricia GalvÃ¡n"", ids = ""122974086""); list(name = ""Alejandro Tres"", ids = ""4996683""); list(name = ""Javier CortÃ©s"", ids = ""93450872""); list(name = ""Santiago RamÃ³n Y Cajal"", ids = ""4371083""); list(name = ""Isabel T.

437b1a14ff2427d14b78446acd1b0c0f7f47bb1c,Extensive transcriptome changes during seasonal leaf senescence in field-grown black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa Nisqually-1),"To better understand the molecular control of leaf senescence, we examined transcriptome changes during seasonal leaf senescence in Populus trichocarpa Nisqually-1, the Populus reference genome, growing in its natural habitat. Using monthly (from May to October) transcriptomes for three years (2009, 2015, and 2016), we identified 17,974 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; false discovery rate <0.05; log-fold change cutoff = 0) from 36,007 expressed Populus gene models. A total of 14,415 DEGs were directly related to transitions between four major developmental phases â€“ growth, senescence initiation, reorganization, and senescence termination. These DEGs were significantly (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) enriched in 279 gene ontology (GO) terms, including those related to photosynthesis, metabolic process, catalytic activity, protein phosphorylation, kinase activity, pollination, and transport. Also, there were 881 differentially expressed transcription factor (TF) genes from 54 TF families, notably bHLH, MYB, ERF, MYB-related, NAC, and WRKY. We also examined 28 DEGs known as alternative splicing (AS) factors that regulate AS process, and found evidence for a reduced level of AS activity during leaf senescence.

To examine potential vulnerabilities in foreskin epithelial structure, we used Wilcoxon paired tests adjusted using the false discovery rate method to compare inner and outer foreskin samples from 20 healthy, sexually active Peruvian males who have sex with males or transgender females, ages 21-29, at elevated risk of HIV infection. No evidence of epithelial microtrauma was identified, as assessed by keratinocyte activation, fibronectin deposition, or parakeratosis. However, multiple suprabasal tight junction differences were identified: 1) inner foreskin stratum corneum was thinner than outer (pâ€Š=â€Š0.035); 2) claudin 1 had extended membrane-bound localization throughout inner epidermis stratum spinosum (pâ€Š=â€Š0.035); 3) membrane-bound claudin 4 was absent from inner foreskin stratum granulosum (pâ€Š=â€Š0.035); and 4) occludin had increased membrane deposition in inner foreskin stratum granulosum (pâ€Š=â€Š0.042) versus outer. Together, this suggests subclinical inflammation and paracellular transport modifications to the inner foreskin. A setting of inflammation was further supported by inner foreskin epithelial explant cultures secreting higher levels of GM-CSF (pâ€Š=â€Š0.029), IP-10 (pâ€Š=â€Š0.035) and RANTES (pâ€Š=â€Š0.022) than outer foreskin, and also containing an increased density of CCR5+ and CD4+ CCR5+ cells (pâ€Š=â€Š0.022). Inner foreskin dermis also secreted more RANTES than outer (pâ€Š=â€Š0.036), and had increased density of CCR5+ cells (pâ€Š=â€Š0.022). In conclusion, subclinical changes to the inner foreskin of sexually active males may support an inflammatory state, with availability of target cells for HIV infection and modifications to epidermal barriers, potentially explaining the benefits of circumcision for STI prevention.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Maria Eduarda Peixoto Lemos"", ids = ""49212411""); list(name = ""Javier R.

66a864ca0e744d46b06d7d45b2eb4195f9ad9dac,Untargeted Plasma Metabolomics Identifies Endogenous Metabolite with Drug-like Properties in Chronic Animal Model of Multiple Sclerosis*,"We performed untargeted metabolomics in plasma of B6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) at the chronic phase of the disease in search of an altered metabolic pathway(s). Of 324 metabolites measured, 100 metabolites that mapped to various pathways (mainly lipids) linked to mitochondrial function, inflammation, and membrane stability were observed to be significantly altered between EAE and control (p < 0.05, false discovery rate <0.10). Bioinformatics analysis revealed six metabolic pathways being impacted and altered in EAE, including Î±-linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolism (PUFA). The metabolites of PUFAs, including Ï‰-3 and Ï‰-6 fatty acids, are commonly decreased in mouse models of multiple sclerosis (MS) and in patients with MS. Daily oral administration of resolvin D1, a downstream metabolite of Ï‰-3, decreased disease progression by suppressing autoreactive T cells and inducing an M2 phenotype of monocytes/macrophages and resident brain microglial cells. This study provides a proof of principle for the application of metabolomics to identify an endogenous metabolite(s) possessing drug-like properties, which is assessed for therapy in preclinical mouse models of MS.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Laila M.

6b2308c5b880014ed2eaa1cdf0b9f496fa051c5f,HiChIP-Peaks: A HiChIP peak calling algorithm.,"MOTIVATION
HiChIP is a powerful tool to interrogate 3D chromatin organization. Current tools to analyse chromatin looping mechanisms using HiChIP data require the identification of loop anchors to work properly. However, current approaches to discover these anchors from HiChIP data are not satisfactory, having either a very high false discovery rate or strong dependence on sequencing depth. Moreover, these tools do not allow quantitative comparison of peaks across different samples, failing to fully exploit the information available from HiChIP datasets.


RESULTS
We develop a new tool based on a representation of HiChIP data centred on the re-ligation sites to identify peaks from HiChIP datasets, which can subsequently be used in other tools for loop discovery. This increases the reliability of these tools and improves recall rate as sequencing depth is reduced. We also provide a method to count reads mapping to peaks across samples, which can be used for differential peak analysis using HiChIP data.

6d0fef2d29fd502b3ee99ebacdc03329b3c395e6,Iron Deficiency Modifies Gene Expression Variation Induced by Augmented Hypoxia Sensing,"Abstract 1765 Hypoxia may cause pulmonary and brain edema, pulmonary hypertension, aberrant metabolism and early mortality. To better understand pathological processes associated with hypoxia, we examined gene expression in Chuvash polycythemia blood mononuclear cells. Chuvash polycythemia is a congenital disorder of up-regulated hypoxic response at normoxia wherein VHL R200W homozygosity leads to elevated hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 and HIF-2 levels, thromboses, pulmonary hypertension, lower systemic blood pressure (SBP) and increased mortality. VHL R200W homozygotes are often treated by phlebotomy resulting in iron deficiency, allowing us to evaluate an interaction of augmented hypoxia sensing with iron deficiency. Expression profiling of 8 VHL R200W homozygotes and 17 VHL wildtype individuals, matched for normal iron status as reflected in serum ferritin concentration, revealed altered regulation of 3069 genes at false discovery rate VHL R200W homozygotes. Genes induced by homozygous VHL R200W were enriched in immune response pathways; those repressed in RNA transcription and protein synthesis pathways. Forty-two genes showed a >1.5-fold change in expression level, mostly (74%) an increase. Seven showed a >2-fold increase: CA1 (carbonic anhydrase), SELENBP1 (selenium binding protein 1), IL1B (interleukin 1 beta), SLC4A1 (solute carrier family 4 member 1), HBB (hemoglobin beta), and AHSP (alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein). Additional studies including 16 VHL R200W homozygotes with low ferritin indicated that iron deficiency enhanced the induction effect of VHL R200W for 51 of the 847 upregulated genes and suppressed the induction effect for 108 of the upregulated genes. Genes further upregulated by iron deficiency included CA1 , CSDA (cold shock domain protein A), BCL2L1 (BCL-2 like 1), BPGM (2,3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase), DCAF12 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 12), FECH (ferrochelatase), SELENBP1 and SLC4A1. Genes for which iron deficiency suppressed the induction included inflammatory and immune pathway genes such as CASP5, CXCL16, IFI30, IFI35, IRF5, LILRB1, NOD2, RELT, TCIRG1 and TNFAIP2 . A number of the genes with altered regulation in VHL R200W homozygotes might modify risk of thrombosis (upregulated: F3, SERPINE1, SERPINB2, SERPING1 , PLAUR, THBD; down regulated: SERBP1 ), elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (upregulated: HTR1B, THBS1 ; downregulated: S1PR1, STIM2), or benign hemangioma (downregulated: CCM2). However, expression of these genes tended not to be influenced by iron status. VEGF was induced in VHL R200W homozygotes and surprisingly this induction was suppressed by iron deficiency. Expression relationships suggested a broad effect of VHL R200W in reducing systolic blood pressure through inducing VEGF. We demonstrate that many genes have commensurate changes of their expression by both iron deficiency and VHL R200W associated normoxic up-regulation of HIFs, as expected. However, there are genes that are regulated asynchronously. Further research is needed to define the molecular bases of separate regulation of genes by HIFs and iron status and to define relative risks and benefits of therapeutic phlebotomy for polycythemia. The resulting elucidation of the genomic pathways affecting predisposition to thromboses, pulmonary hypertension, lower systolic blood pressure and the interaction of augmented hypoxia sensing with iron deficiency should have broad implications leading to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of many diseases and the development of targeted therapies.

10d8ff228772cc3d833b1de1e3be3e56a2927240,"Co-exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals, four common polymorphisms in microRNA genes, and their gene-environment interactions: Influences on oxidative damage levels in Chinese coke oven workers.","BACKGROUND
Human are often simultaneously exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals, yet relatively little is known regarding their co-exposure effects on oxidative damage. Genetic factors and the gene-environment interactions can also determine the severity of oxidative damage. Four polymorphisms in microRNA (miRNA) genes (rs11614913, rs2292832, rs2910164, and rs3746444) have been well-studied to be associated with oxidative damage-related diseases.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate the influences of PAH-metal co-exposure, four polymorphisms, and their interactions on oxidative damage levels.


METHODS
We conducted a cross-sectional study in 1385 coke oven workers. We quantified exposure levels of PAHs and metals by urinary monohydroxy-PAHs, plasma benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-albumin adducts, and urinary metals, respectively, and measured oxidative damage levels by 8-iso-prostaglandin-F2Î± and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine. We also genotyped four polymorphisms.


RESULTS
In multiple-pollutant models, 8-iso-prostaglandin-F2Î± and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine were associated with multiple PAH exposure biomarkers, as well as with multiple metals (ptrendâ€¯<â€¯0.05). Metabolites of phenanthrene and pyrene interacted synergistically with lead and zinc to influence 8-iso-prostaglandin-F2Î± (Î²interactionâ€¯>â€¯7.75%, false discovery rate-adjusted pinteractionâ€¯â‰¤â€¯2.25â€¯Ã—â€¯10-5). Significantly higher 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine was observed in carriers of rs11614913 CC variant homozygote than TC carriers (pâ€¯=â€¯0.037). Associations of the number of rs11614913 C allele with increased 8-iso-prostaglandin-F2Î± and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine were significant (Î²stdâ€¯>â€¯0, ptrendâ€¯<â€¯0.05) and more pronounced in workers with lower metals [p for modifying effect (pME) < 0.040]. Positive associations of some PAHs and metals with 8-iso-prostaglandin-F2Î± and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine were weaker in carriers of rs11614913 CC genotype or C allele (pMEâ€¯<â€¯0.05).


CONCLUSION
PAH-metal co-exposure, rs11614913, and their interactions may affect oxidative damage levels in Chinese population in a complex manner that are worthy of further investigation.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yunling Xie"", ids = ""91025252""); list(name = ""Tao Lin"", ids = ""145724660""); list(name = ""Ming Shu Yang"", ids = ""50367623""); list(name = ""Zhaorui Zhang"", ids = ""1740943""); list(name = ""Na Deng"", ids = ""48709439""); list(name = ""Mengqi Tang"", ids = ""47605317""); list(name = ""Yongmei Xiao"", ids = ""2438747""); list(name = ""Huan Guo"", ids = ""1729940""); list(name = ""Qifei Deng"", ids = ""4056042"")",,,Environment international,132,"

fa25b5120ce2b824613f4db97a2782de15285b74,A Semiparametric Bayesian Approach for Estimating the Gene Expression Distribution,"Gene expression microarrays are powerful tools for global comparison and estimation of gene expression. Many microarray studies have demonstrated biologically plausible results with only a few arrays, leading to a misperception that a handful of hybridized arrays can always find something meaningful. From a statistical point of view, it is important to prospectively estimate required sample sizes prior to undertaking a microarray experiment. However, all sample size calculations need to directly or indirectly estimate the unknown distribution of the effect sizes of gene expression intensities. A parametric mixture model has been developed for relating the sample size directly to the false discovery rate (FDR), the most popular multiple-comparison control criteria. In this paper, we extend the parametric mixture model and propose a robust semiparametric Dirichlet process mixture model, where the parametric distribution of gene expressions is no longer specified. This analysis is performed in a Bayesian inference framework using Markov-chain Monte Carlo steps. The usefulness of the method is illustrated by simulations and a real murine lung study.",2010,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Fei Zou"", ids = ""50609115""); list(name = ""Hanwen Huang"", ids = ""2996930""); list(name = ""Joseph G.

93f9e6f7b86a0ad0d8534814f9b92377ca7c03d7,Rejoinder on: Control of the false discovery rate underÂ dependence using the bootstrap and subsampling,"This paper considers the problem of testing s null hypotheses simultaneously while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Benjamini and Hochberg (J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B 57(1):289â€“300, 1995) provide a method for controlling the FDR based on p-values for each of the null hypotheses under the assumption that the p-values are independent. Subsequent research has since shown that this procedure is valid under weaker assumptions on the joint distribution of the p-values. Related procedures that are valid under no assumptions on the joint distribution of the p-values have also been developed. None of these procedures, however, incorporate information about the dependence structure of the test statistics. This paper develops methods for control of the FDR under weak assumptions that incorporate such information and, by doing so, are better able to detect false null hypotheses. We illustrate this property via a simulation study and two empirical applications. In particular, the bootstrap method is competitive with methods that require independence if independence holds, but it outperforms these methods under dependence.

12cfc81349deaed4ec5709e9cc9db28abdfb0298,Gene expression Exploiting sample variability to enhance multivariate analysis of microarray data,"Motivation: Biological and technical variability is intrinsic in any microarray experiment. While most approaches aim to account for this variability, they do not actively exploit it. Here, we consider a novel approach that uses the variability between arrays to provide an extra source of information that can enhance gene expression analyses. Results: We develop a method that uses sample similarity to incorporate sample variability into the analysis of gene expression profiles. This allows each pairwise correlation calculation to borrow information from all the data in the experiment. Results on synthetic and human cancer microarray datasets show that the inclusion of this information leads to a significant increase in the ability to identify previously characterized relationships and a reduction in false discovery rate, when compared to a standard analysis using Pearson correlation. The information carried by the variability between arrays can be exploited to significantly improve the analysis of gene",2007,,"list(name = ""Carla S.

7df504aa16365bf5775b4c57f3c48aa8633274bb,An Example-Based Multi-Atlas Approach to Automatic Labeling of White Matter Tracts,"We present an example-based multi-atlas approach for classifying white matter (WM) tracts into anatomic bundles. Our approach exploits expert-provided example data to automatically classify the WM tracts of a subject. Multiple atlases are constructed to model the example data from multiple subjects in order to reflect the individual variability of bundle shapes and trajectories over subjects. For each example subject, an atlas is maintained to allow the example data of a subject to be added or deleted flexibly. A voting scheme is proposed to facilitate the multi-atlas exploitation of example data. For conceptual simplicity, we adopt the same metrics in both example data construction and WM tract labeling. Due to the huge number of WM tracts in a subject, it is time-consuming to label each WM tract individually. Thus, the WM tracts are grouped according to their shape similarity, and WM tracts within each group are labeled simultaneously. To further enhance the computational efficiency, we implemented our approach on the graphics processing unit (GPU). Through nested cross-validation we demonstrated that our approach yielded high classification performance. The average sensitivities for bundles in the left and right hemispheres were 89.5% and 91.0%, respectively, and their average false discovery rates were 14.9% and 14.2%, respectively.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sang Wook Yoo"", ids = ""7291874""); list(name = ""Pamela Guevara"", ids = ""145129436""); list(name = ""Yong Jeong"", ids = ""144798992""); list(name = ""Kwangsun Yoo"", ids = ""40374140""); list(name = ""Joseph S.

e22fdbc182f6f66c42d940c4a283aee529271c11,"GIMAP GTPase family genes: potential modifiers in autoimmune diabetes, asthma, and allergy.","GTPase of the immunity-associated protein (GIMAP) family members are differentially regulated during human Th cell differentiation and have been previously connected to immune-mediated disorders in animal studies. GIMAP4 is believed to contribute to the Th cell subtype-driven immunological balance via its role in T cell survival. GIMAP5 has a key role in BB-DR rat and NOD mouse lymphopenia. To elucidate GIMAP4 and GIMAP5 function and role in human immunity, we conducted a study combining genetic association in different immunological diseases and complementing functional analyses. Single nucleotide polymorphisms tagging the GIMAP haplotype variation were genotyped in Finnish type 1 diabetes (T1D) families and in a prospective Swedish asthma and allergic sensitization birth cohort. Initially, GIMAP5 rs6965571 was associated with risk for asthma and allergic sensitization (odds ratio [OR] 3.74, p = 0.00072, and OR 2.70, p = 0.0063, respectively) and protection from T1D (OR 0.64, p = 0.0058); GIMAP4 rs13222905 was associated with asthma (OR 1.28, p = 0.035) and allergic sensitization (OR 1.27, p = 0.0068). However, after false discovery rate correction for multiple testing, only the associations of GIMAP4 with allergic sensitization and GIMAP5 with asthma remained significant. In addition, transcription factor binding sites surrounding the associated loci were predicted. A gene-gene interaction in the T1D data were observed between the IL2RA rs2104286 and GIMAP4 rs9640279 (OR 1.52, p = 0.0064) and indicated between INS rs689 and GIMAP5 rs2286899. The follow-up functional analyses revealed lower IL-2RA expression upon GIMAP4 knockdown and an effect of GIMAP5 rs2286899 genotype on protein expression.

31eff82cd31a62ee87d6c85597df84c0708acfb2,Differential expression analysis of JAK/STAT pathway related genes in breast cancer,"Abstract Aberrant activation of intracellular signaling pathways confer malignant properties on cancer cells in humans. The Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is involved in the regulation of various aspects of the hematological system and immune regulation, and thus the JAK/STAT pathway genes are the important component of cytokine signaling. Their function as activators of various mediators of inflammation and their role in carcinogenesis puts them at important junctures with other signaling pathways. Deregulation of the immune system and chronic inflammation are two key aspects of carcinogenesis. Hence, involvement of the JAK/STAT pathway role in breast cancer has been our thrust area of research. Our studies included the analysis of expression level variations of JAK/STAT pathway genes related to various subsets of breast cancer such as invasive (or infiltrating) ductal carcinoma (IDC), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), tubular carcinoma (TC) using Oncomine web resource. Thus for meta analysis, differential expression datasets of breast cancer and normal breast tissue were retrieved based on statistical parameters. False discovery rate limits the data mining efficiency, and thus we defined the P value 2 as a threshold. Functional enrichment analysis based on gene ontology (GO) and network analysis was performed to assess the differentially expressed genes (DEG) hubness based on centrality parameters. The present findings suggest that differentially expressed genes and their role in abrogated pathways in different breast cancers would be the targets for diagnostic and prognostic approaches.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Jemmy Christy"", ids = ""121323686""); list(name = ""L.

1f0f35b260fc79379a4bdc8e88d79a099545a9c6,A signal processing approach for enriched region detection in RNA polymerase II ChIP-seq data,"BackgroundRNA polymerase II (PolII) is essential in gene transcription and ChIP-seq experiments have been used to study PolII binding patterns over the entire genome. However, since PolII enriched regions in the genome can be very long, existing peak finding algorithms for ChIP-seq data are not adequate for identifying such long regions.MethodsHere we propose an enriched region detection method for ChIP-seq data to identify long enriched regions by combining a signal denoising algorithm with a false discovery rate (FDR) approach. The binned ChIP-seq data for PolII are first processed using a non-local means (NL-means) algorithm for purposes of denoising. Then, a FDR approach is developed to determine the threshold for marking enriched regions in the binned histogram.ResultsWe first test our method using a public PolII ChIP-seq dataset and compare our results with published results obtained using the published algorithm HPeak. Our results show a high consistency with the published results (80-100%). Then, we apply our proposed method on PolII ChIP-seq data generated in our own study on the effects of hormone on the breast cancer cell line MCF7. The results demonstrate that our method can effectively identify long enriched regions in ChIP-seq datasets. Specifically, pertaining to MCF7 control samples we identified 5,911 segments with length of at least 4 Kbp (maximum 233,000 bp); and in MCF7 treated with E2 samples, we identified 6,200 such segments (maximum 325,000 bp).ConclusionsWe demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in studying binding patterns of PolII in cancer cells which enables further deep analysis in transcription regulation and epigenetics. Our method complements existing peak detection algorithms for ChIP-seq experiments.",2012,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Zhi Han"", ids = ""144236633""); list(name = ""Lu Tian"", ids = ""144021493""); list(name = ""Thierry PÃ©cot"", ids = ""3158930""); list(name = ""Tim Hui-Ming Huang"", ids = ""153652822""); list(name = ""Raghu Machiraju"", ids = ""1707285""); list(name = ""Kun Huang"", ids = ""145548974"")",318b881e6d18bdb6f0e249c1248a26b007cdeeaa; 06bb9c7a1bce9f8c99c002974d591326b7bf9365; 1f0f35b260fc79379a4bdc8e88d79a099545a9c6,856e2e2e93700a9eac9dffe2ecf902f6e0eded42; 42abddd227d653a0375d7d037ddb885f6c07f66f; d986a985f093614e70451abd84335b3974ee1685; 51fb44cc781d6eeefce29655dcaccde7eddbc6c0; a041be5af6fd2301a029c2d2d5223f4c9385c47b; f1572336f444cd45cef96320d14c250d6d5b865b; 387993749936c23161778e43865aff43354afdc1; baac1c9c5b1d67654799e0bc9915881220d72bc6; 69f27669be485fc73ca044f24fcca8d1180c93dd; 80d2dec00197ad00d9d99e0fd1d43cab299cfc56; c5d15702ed2bed2160e668ce5197c1005db8ca70; 208ebe27e70640de8a94f0638fb13bfda71cd943; 3a7536f9c63af6456d5f757ca755f8234c10ba5c; 1f0f35b260fc79379a4bdc8e88d79a099545a9c6; dd776d9f93a206ef44253b05eb38626d587b1fb9; bb478fc83df4331b8603de59a50085946cf941c1; 191644ccc14385ff062b6595e6b6362589880b2b; 107db2432fbb2e94eb8351c9659056c03d3cea84; a1d9002beb8a069cb3b6ea7b02928bc0baf2f978; 9c842b2926fd60b9e6ff80fee28c65e7c1ae5f1d; 4288430e2db570e9273bc46c7c821eff202ae333; 842204e75e5b04df1b056c62f0c390cea314f13b,BMC Bioinformatics,13,S2 - S2

To evaluate BioGraphâ€™s performance, we run five sequencing replicates of the individual HG002 through the BioGraph variant calling pipeline, as well as two other short-read sv-calling pipelines. BioGraph detects the GIAB benchmark SVs at a peak sensitivity of â‰ˆ59% compared to â‰ˆ42% sensitivity from the other pipelines. The overall precision of BioGraph is lower than other pipelines (â‰ˆ81% and â‰ˆ90%, respectively), however, adjusting for quality score, BioGraph calls were sensitive to a greater number of SV calls given the same false discovery rate compared to the other pipelines. Cumulatively â‰ˆ77% of GIAB benchmark SVs are discovered by BioGraph in at least one replicate. After merging discovered calls and running BioGraph Coverage to create a squared-off project-level VCF, we find â‰ˆ90% percent of discovered true positive alleles have at least 5x coverage in all replicates, thus increasing per-replicate recall of alleles having at least 1x coverage to â‰ˆ76.9%.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Adam C.

ca0d77d85c01096326a07bda69845690716512c7,The presence or absence alone of miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) successfully discriminate amongst the 32 TCGA cancer types,"Previously, we demonstrated that miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) are constitutive and their expression profiles depend on tissue, tissue state, and disease subtype. We have now extended our isomiR studies to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repository. Specifically, we studied whether isomiR profiles can distinguish amongst the 32 cancers. We analyzed 10,271 datasets from 32 cancers and found 7,466 isomiRs from 807 miRNA hairpin-arms to be expressed above threshold. Using the top 20% most abundant isomiRs, we built a classifier that relied on â€œbinaryâ€ isomiR profiles: isomiRs were simply represented as â€˜presentâ€™ or â€˜absentâ€™ and, unlike previous methods, all knowledge about their expression levels was ignored. The classifier could label tumor samples with an average sensitivity of 93% and a False Discovery Rate of 3%. Notably, its ability to classify well persisted even when we reduced the set of used features (=isomiRs) by a factor of 10.

Fetuses overexposed to cortisol have increased risks of disease in later life. DNA methylation may be the underlying association between prenatal cortisol exposure and health effects. We investigated associations between maternal CRH levels and epigenome-wide DNA methylation of cord blood in offsprings and evaluated whether these associations persisted into mid-childhood.MethodsWe investigated mother-child pairs enrolled in the prospective Project Viva pre-birth cohort. We measured DNA methylation in 257 umbilical cord blood samples using the HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip. We tested associations of maternal CRH concentration with cord blood cells DNA methylation, adjusting the model for maternal age at enrollment, education, maternal race/ethnicity, maternal smoking status, pre-pregnancy body mass index, parity, gestational age at delivery, child sex, and cell-type composition in cord blood. We further examined the persistence of associations between maternal CRH levels and DNA methylation in childrenâ€™s blood cells collected at mid-childhood (nâ€‰=â€‰239, age: 6.7â€“10.3 years) additionally adjusting for the childrenâ€™s age at blood drawn.ResultsMaternal CRH levels are associated with DNA methylation variability in cord blood cells at 96 individual CpG sites (False Discovery Rate <0.05). Among the 96 CpG sites, we identified 3 CpGs located near the LEP gene. Regional analyses confirmed the association between maternal CRH and DNA methylation near LEP. Moreover, higher maternal CRH levels were associated with higher blood-cell DNA methylation of the promoter region of LEP in mid-childhood (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, Î²â€‰=â€‰0.64, SEâ€‰=â€‰0.30).ConclusionIn our cohort, maternal CRH was associated with DNA methylation levels in newborns at multiple loci, notably in the LEP gene promoter.

d4027f4ffb1a572ca80f60047ed310c7e57d68a3,Swiss cheese striatum: clinical implications.,"IMPORTANCE
Markedly enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces throughout the striatum appear occasionally on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the elderly, and this type of striatum is known as the Swiss cheese striatum (SCS); however, its clinical impact is unknown.


OBJECTIVE
To determine the clinical features associated with SCS detected on MRI scans.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
A blinded, retrospective case-control study using medical records from 2000 to 2007 obtained from an MRI database at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, of residents 40 years of age or older of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who had extensive Mayo Clinic medical records and MRI reports suggestive of SCS. Cases with a severe form of SCS (nâ€‰=â€‰27) were randomly selected for comparison with age-, sex-, and examination year-matched controls (nâ€‰=â€‰52) with a minimal form of SCS or no SCS.


EXPOSURE
Magnetic resonance imaging.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Associations of clinical and imaging features with the presence of a severe form of SCS. Medical records were reviewed for clinical features such as parkinsonism, dementia, and vascular risk factors. The MRI scans were visually scored for degree of leukoaraiosis, central atrophy, and cortical atrophy.


RESULTS
No significant differences were found between those with a severe form of SCS and controls in rates of parkinsonism (19% vs 17%; odds ratio, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.28-4.16]) or dementia of any type (30% vs 21%; odds ratio, 1.57 [95% CI, 0.48-5.13]). Vascular risk factors were not significantly different between groups. Swiss cheese striatum correlated with degree of leukoaraiosis (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Potential associations with visualized cortical atrophy (Pâ€‰=â€‰.01), nonobstructive urinary incontinence (18.5% vs 3.9%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.04), and syncope (37% vs 9.6%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.01) did not hold up after correction for the false discovery rate.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
Our study suggests that marked cribriform change in the striatum was not associated with the development of extrapyramidal clinical disorders, including parkinsonism. The association of SCS with leukoaraiosis suggests that it is part of a more generalized cerebrovascular process. Skepticism is called for when attributing clinical symptoms to this MRI finding.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Melinda S. Burnett"", ids = ""47871995""); list(name = ""Robert J.

df948b1f8fac6404728e3655a93a6df5f2892fdd,Onset of lactation in the bovine mammary gland: gene expression profiling indicates a strong inhibition of gene expression in cell proliferation,"The mammary gland undergoes dramatic functional and metabolic changes during the transition from late pregnancy to lactation. To better understand the molecular events underlying these changes, we analyzed expression profiles of approximately 23,000 gene transcripts in bovine mammary tissue about day 5 before parturition and day 10 after parturition. At the cutoff criteria of the signed fold change â‰¥2 or â‰¤âˆ’2 and false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤0.1, a total of 389 transcripts (1.6%) were significantly differentially expressed at the two stages. Of these transcripts with significant changes, 105 were up-regulated while 284 were down-regulated. Gene ontology analysis showed that the main up-regulated genes were those associated with transport activity (amino acid, glucose, and ion transporters), lipid and carbohydrate metabolism (lipoprotein lipase, acetyl-Coenzyme A synthetases, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, etc.), and cell signaling factors (protein p8, Rab18, etc.). The main down-regulated genes were associated with cell cycle and proliferation (cyclins, cell division cycle associated proteins, etc.), DNA replication and chromosome organization (centromere proteins, minichromosome maintenance proteins, histone, etc.), microtubule-based processes (microtubule associated protein tau, kinesin, tubulins, etc.), and protein and RNA degradation (proteasome, proteasome activator, RNA binding motif protein, etc.). The increased expression of glucose transporter GLUT1 mRNA during lactation was verified by quantitative reverse transcription/polymerase chain reactin (PCR) (P < 0.05). GLUT1 protein also increased twofold during lactation (P < 0.05). Furthermore, GLUT1 protein was primarily localized in mammary ductal epithelia and blood vessel endothelia before parturition, but was predominantly localized in the basolateral and apical membranes of mammary alveolar epithelial cells during lactation. Our microarray data provide insight into the molecular events in the mammary gland at the onset of lactation, indicating the up-regulation of genes involved in milk synthesis concomitant with the inhibition of those related to cell proliferation.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kiera A.

b8ec56d9bbfe9ad024fa3e973b3ce592eb221429,Salivary Proteins Associated with Periodontitis in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"The objective of this study was to investigate the salivary proteins that are associated with periodontitis in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Volunteers for the study were patients from the Diabetic Unit, University of Malaya Medical Centre, whose periodontal status was determined. The diabetic volunteers were divided into two groups, i.e., patients with periodontitis and those who were periodontally healthy. Saliva samples were collected and treated with 10% TCA/acetone/20 mM DTT to precipitate the proteins, which were then separated using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel images were scanned using the GS-800(TM) Calibrated Densitometer. The protein spots were analyzed and expressed in percentage volumes. The percentage volume of each protein spot was subjected to Mann-Whitney statistical analysis using SPSS software and false discovery rate correction. When the expression of the salivary proteins was compared between the T2DM patients with periodontitis with those who were periodontally healthy, seven proteins, including polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, plastin-2, actin related protein 3, leukocyte elastase inhibitor, carbonic anhydrases 6, immunoglobulin J and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, were found to be differentially expressed (p < 0.01304).

4964fb6bf75a6220d8bf5895f1278c9eb8c3890b,Comparative transcriptome analysis of Triticum aestivum in response to nitrogen stress,"Nitrogen (N) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development. Insufficient supply of N leads to extensive physiological and biochemical changes in plant. However, the molecular mechanisms of response to N are still unknown. In this study, global transcriptome profiles of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaf and root under limited and sufficient N conditions were generated using Illumina RNA-sequencing. Then SeqPrep and Sickle were used to filter the raw reads and genes were assembled and predicted using Trinity. The Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) for wheat transcripts were obtained from GO and KEGG databases, respectively. Clusters of orthologous group terms were obtained using Blastx 2.2.24+ in STRING 9.0. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were then screened using edgeR software with false discovery rate <0.05 and |log2FC| â‰¥ 1, followed by the proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) network construction for DEGs using Cytoscape. As a result, 126956 transcripts were obtained. Among them, 47590 transcripts were categorized into 56 GO terms, such as metabolic process; 25607 transcripts were assigned to 42 KEGG pathways, such as metabolic pathways; and 27194 unique sequences were classified into 25 COG categories, such as transcription. Moreover, 1267 (179 up-regulated and 1088 down-regulated) and 1996 DEGs (868 up-regulated and 1128 down-regulated) were obtained in leaf and root, respectively. In the PPI networks, BRADI1G77050.1, BRADI2G40600.1 and rpl2 were found to be the hub nodes. Thus, these screened DEGs might be associated with N metabolism and stress response in wheat, especially BRADI1G77050.1, BRADI2G40600.1 and rpl2.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""S. C.

This paper presents an in-depth statistical analysis of risk-adjusted mortality of ICU admissions from 2000 to 2010 for the purpose of identifying ICUs with unusual performance.MethodsA cohort of 523,462 patients from 144 ICUs was analysed. For each ICU, the natural logarithm of the standardised mortality ratio (log-SMR) was estimated from a risk-adjusted, three-level hierarchical model. This is the first time a three-level model has been fitted to such a large ICU database anywhere. The analysis was conducted in three stages which included the estimation of a null distribution to describe usual ICU performance. Log-SMRs with appropriate estimates of standard errors are presented in a funnel plot using 5% false discovery rate thresholds. False coverage-statement rate confidence intervals are also presented. The observed numbers of deaths for ICUs identified as unusual are compared to the predicted true worst numbers of deaths under the model for usual ICU performance.ResultsSeven ICUs were identified as performing unusually over the period 2000 to 2010, in particular, demonstrating high risk-adjusted mortality compared to the majority of ICUs. Four of the seven were ICUs in private hospitals. Our three-stage approach to the analysis detected outlying ICUs which were not identified in a conventional (single) risk-adjusted model for mortality using SMRs to compare ICUs. We also observed a significant linear decline in mortality over the decade. Distinct yearly and weekly respiratory seasonal effects were observed across regions of Australia and New Zealand for the first time.ConclusionsThe statistical approach proposed in this paper is intended to be used for the review of observed ICU and hospital mortality. Two important messages from our study are firstly, that comprehensive risk-adjustment is essential in modelling patient mortality for comparing performance, and secondly, that the appropriate statistical analysis is complicated.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Patricia J.

Recent genome-wide association studies have identified a few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are associated with body mass index (BMI)/obesity. This study aimed to examine the identified associations among a population of Chinese children.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Five SNPs (SEC16B rs10913469, SH2B1 rs4788102, PCSK1rs6235, KCTD15 rs29941, BAT2 rs2844479) were genotyped for a group of Chinese children (NÂ =Â 2849, age range 6-18Â years). A total of 1230 obese cases and 1619 controls with normal weight were identified based on the Chinese age- and sex-specific BMI references.


RESULTS
Of five studied variants, only two (SEC16B rs10913469, SH2B1 rs4788102) were nominally associated with indices of adiposity and obesity risk in girls and only SEC16B rs10913469 in children at puberty (pÂ <Â 0Â·05), while no statistical associations was found for three other variants (PCSK1rs6235, KCTD15 rs29941, BAT2 rs2844479). After false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple testing, none were statistically significant. Further analysis indicated that the genetic risk score (GRS) was associated with BMI, waist circumference and risk of obesity (defined by BMI) in girls, even after FDR adjustment for multiple testing. However, there was no statistical association of GRS with indices of adiposity and risk of obesity in children at puberty after multiple comparison correction.


CONCLUSIONS
This study confirmed the synthetic effect of SNPs on the indices of adiposity and risk of obesity in Chinese girls, but failed to replicate the effect of five separate variants. We also did not found cumulative effect of SNPs in children at puberty.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bo Xi"", ids = ""145484805""); list(name = ""Yue Shen"", ids = ""145295898""); list(name = ""Kathleen H Reilly"", ids = ""6309741""); list(name = ""Xiaoyuan Zhao"", ids = ""2470047""); list(name = ""Hong Cheng"", ids = ""144488755""); list(name = ""Dongqing Hou"", ids = ""4597630""); list(name = ""Xingyu Wang"", ids = ""15592063""); list(name = ""Jie Mi"", ids = ""145226181"")",e12b2ad12dfa185fbbec9a786f00ee4a8049f289; 1fcd350b40bb779187a417f4cda017ca1c9a63af; abda1193eb41cb1649b8d6706f6e310a48738c0b; c004584dd4b6f60049f03223ac83a824b814cdee; 30d473d6f64dae954d99c457ebbe9ebe7776badf; 676e8c1b228029e0c4bbec7aebbb5cfd44b30bcc; d316f8ea1c1ba1192f875b80b2daccb59af7fb34; d0f081bba21fb303f4a8362c735900f0adb044f3; c1aea73ebce3e730c76e1f6aa5f96c8c3df74c4e; 5d442d1fb3c5013f2bd2ae070ee7795d0f0cf27c; 0e7f316790f4217a10733af171f75edfa5c764a3; f282b19f71cc7f01734fbb03c2cc13d9e70f246b,,Clinical endocrinology,79 4,"

d623d0fe3995f5c5ae65b295732b3828d55f65cb,Abstract P1-13-05: The association between timing in adjuvant chemotherapy administration and overall survival for women with breast cancer within the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN),"Introduction: Population based studies (eg, Hershman et al. BCRT 2006 and Lohrisch et al. JCO 2006) showed poorer survival associated with long delays in adjuvant chemotherapy (CTX) initiation following definitive surgery (DS) for women with breast cancer (BC). Delays in CTX following diagnosis (DX) have not been evaluated. The ASCO/NCCN quality measures (QMs) recommend CTX Methods: 4,608 women with stage I-III HER2 negative breast cancer diagnosed between 2000 and 2006 at 8 NCCN centers were identified using the NCCN outcomes database. Patients with T3/4 disease or who received neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. The association between CTX timing and OS was evaluated using multivariate Cox models adjusted for CTX type, age, race, BMI, residential distance, insurance, SES, comorbidity, ER/PR, LVI, grade, T stage, and N stage. The impact of CTX timing was evaluated using a >90-day (d) DS-to-CTX threshold, based on poor outcomes observed in prior studies, and a >120d DX-to-CTX threshold, based on the ASCO/NCCN QMs. Results: Median follow-up was 7.2 years and OS at 7 years was 89%. Overall, 401 (8.7%) patients received CTX >120d after DX and 113 (2.4%) patients received CTX >90d after DS. The DX-to-CTX interval was more strongly correlated with the DX-to-DS (r = 0.74) interval than DS-to-CTX (r = 0.54) interval. A >90d DS-to-CTX interval was significantly associated with poorer survival (HR: 1.65, 95% CI 1.04â€“2.60, p = 0.03) in adjusted analyses. Shorter DS-to-CTX thresholds of >60d (n = 636, HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.89â€“1.43, p = 0.319) or >75d (n = 273, HR: 1.05, 95% CI 0.74â€“1.49, p = 0.76) were not associated with OS. The association between a >120d DX-to-CTX interval and OS was not statistically significant (HR: 1.32, 95% CI 0.99â€“1.76, p = 0.06). Patients who received CTX >135d (n = 231, HR 1.25, 95% CI: 0.87â€“1.81, p = 0.22) or >150d (n = 128, HR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.59â€“2.24, p = 0.69) after DX did not display an increased risk of death. Excluding pathological staging factors from the model had no effect on the results. In subgroup analyses stratified by ER/PR, LVI, grade, T stage or N stage, a >120d delay in CTX did not display significant associations with OS. Among ER/PR negative patients, the association between a >120d delay and OS was borderline non-significant after adjusting the p-value for multiple hypothesis testing using the false discovery rate method (HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.16â€“2.79, p = 0.09). Conclusion: Consistent with previous studies, CTX delays of >90 days following surgery were associated with poorer survival. OS was not significantly compromised in patients with DX-to-CTX intervals >120 days although this analysis may have limited power to detect small effects. More variation in the DX-to-CTX interval was attributed to pre-surgery time which may explain the differences observed between the DX-to-CTX and DS-to-CTX intervals. Among patients with ER/PR negative disease, a non-significant association between OS and a >120 day DX-to-CTX interval was observed that warrants further examination.

La dimension et la complexite des donnees issues de ce nouveau type d'etude posent aujourd'hui de nouvelles perspectives statistiques et informatiques necessaires a leur analyse, constituant le principal axe de recherche de cette these. Apres une description introductive des principales problematiques liees aux etudes d'association a grande echelle, nous abordons plus particulierement les approches simple-marqueur avec une etude de puissance des principaux tests d'association, ainsi que de leur combinaisons. Nous considerons ensuite l'utilisation d'approches multi-marqueurs avec le developpement d'une methode d'analyse fondee a partir de la statistique du Score Local. Celle-ci permet d'identifier des associations statistiques a partir de regions genomiques completes, et non plus des marqueurs pris individuellement. Il s'agit d'une methode simple, rapide et flexible pour laquelle nous evaluons les performances sur des donnees d'association a grande echelle simulees et reelles. Enfin ce travail traite egalement du probleme du test-multiple, lie aux nombre de tests a realiser lors de l'analyse de donnees genetiques ou genomiques haut-debit. La methode que nous proposons a partir du Score Local prend en compte ce probleme. Nous evoquons par ailleurs l'estimation du Local False Discovery Rate a travers un simple modele de melange gaussien.

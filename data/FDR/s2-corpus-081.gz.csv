Neurochemical and structural adaptations in brain following chronic MOPr-agonist administration are thought to underlie pathogenesis and persistence of opiate addiction. Many axon guidance molecules, such as integrins, semaphorins, and ephrins may contribute to oxycodone-induced neuroadaptations through alterations in axon-target connections and synaptogenesis, that may be implicated in the behaviors associated with opiate addiction. However, little is known about this important area. The aim of this study is to investigate alterations in expression of selected integrin, semaphorin, ephrins, netrin, and slit genes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and caudate putamen (CPu) of mice following extended 14-day oxycodone self-administration (SA), using RNAseq. Methods: Total RNA from the NAc and CPu were isolated from adult male C57BL/6J mice within 1 h after the last session of oxycodone in a 14-day self-administration paradigm (4h/day, 0.25 mg/kg/infusion, FR1) or from yoked saline controls. Gene expressions were examined using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology. RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Illumina's TruSeqÂ® Stranded Total RNA LT kit. The reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (version mm10) using STAR. DESeq2 was applied to the counts of protein coding genes to estimate the fold change between the treatment groups. False Discovery Rate (FDR) q < 0.1 were used to select genes that have a significant expression change. For selection of a subset of genes related to axon guidance pathway, REACTOME was used. Results: Among 38 known genes of the integrin, semaphorin, and ephrin gene families, RNA-seq data revealed up-regulation of six genes in the NAc: heterodimer receptor, integrins Itgal, Itgb2, and Itgam, and its ligand semaphorin Sema7a, two semaphorin receptors, plexins Plxnd1 and Plxdc1. There was down-regulation of eight genes in this region: two integrin genes Itga3 and Itgb8, semaphorins Sema3c, Sema4g, Sema6a, Sema6d, semaphorin receptor neuropilin Nrp2, and ephrin receptor Epha3. In the CPu, there were five differentially expressed axon guidance genes: up-regulation of three integrin genes, Itgal, Itgb2, Itga1, and down-regulation of Itga9 and ephrin Efna3 were thus observed. No significant alterations in expression of Netrin-1 or Slit were observed. Conclusion: We provide evidence for alterations in the expression of selective axon guidance genes in adult mouse brain following chronic self-administration of oxycodone. Further examination of oxycodone-induced changes in the expression of these specific axon guidance molecules and integrin genes in relation to behavior may provide new insights into development of addiction to oxycodone.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Vadim P Yuferov"", ids = ""46662854""); list(name = ""Yong Zhang"", ids = ""145750062""); list(name = ""Yupu Liang"", ids = ""39084986""); list(name = ""Connie Zhao"", ids = ""4265845""); list(name = ""Matthew Randesi"", ids = ""5715101""); list(name = ""Mary Jeanne Kreek"", ids = ""5273773"")",881a62714ddbd5fb57ff1e6c349ebe7d33865f55; e036949cc081d839dbf101513b62e6070019e0a9; 5358694792364de7e3fc838b1f1eba141fbb8457; d15d7e56a16a0b7af32fafe502939d97e0a8407e; 824fdf965ecee9a0d65e727034150bf41f02046d; 375501df2ec297f90e305956877813e37a375aa3,959dc2cc8f7d954decd7324822111f088118ca19; 45b3b42d18da173f28fab945ec1db458de5015c3; b288393f7109b49976ce88d990b0d9e71399764f; df74346f87c5498545a0580599f1f98bad8e2422; 772f5fca88de0f6f38116d73cc32e23efe780a10; f57b9e2700e13d773841aca8587ee050dd4f8299; d55f4aadd188b22439131d891a30ff7d8f20dbe1; 054524e4740f22d61c3371406242843652255a68; 7aeb36e201ba5e14b59611df993845d75415acf4; cdbe8a265ef4bd8350722d2209fc6cc6290da1b3; e601521a334bffb0797e3942ea2dc4ed352bd0f7; a401affeebb22938308fda6437eb0e0f241a028f; 0b6b47019b1d0e72644d61ed7176e092b112c10d; 59564dc9d6f0549e6ea2d333474b9f6e4d4cfc74; ade8d9747377380e9b7408c90d14e446c8c8745a; 67d51ff72e2bfb1fc2eb57dfcd4bc651421491e5; db798f67acd409bcad4ff330ecce810c3dc6611a; 7aa35e9d0a64aaa711ddf024e2b196d4e59dd933; 781c14b26d0c2a03640886f43bb1ba7d2c9edbf2; 28fd1ecca2addb7353d20656dc07c55129060085; 15552cd19b1bb600743fca8fd59350e9bcfa27fb; ed0a73406ec672826d8f098185034ba1aca96e9b; c571eca7c3aeb1cee7bb28d40082f7eebc34c4d7; c9b94df36183d880403fcaaf5ba8b5b74d022de8; 2a6879998da1241ec1af9fadbd9254384e0393dc; 4c2b0919e6e3c48803914be2e70fbce4ed2089a2; d54afc12277189e35c29f4b732cde99d6283ed21; 962c464a21be8a03030ba43e74d2e9d3ffd3383d; 874f9ab6c43ab6a48e6b0dc74f478dcfdcd402fa; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 5f5426242a8eba77a976e97ab98ef953590c5470; f7d04e7c68e7292f984581027b12d71d0f05bf42; f580e1a11192418ce9a42abe036c3d1fd052d85d; 78ce0c149860363bbbe34306c75a4454ad23828d; b0d428716d09b90af44167fa146ae925848a7ef4; a1879726457dec38c94535bf3850025477b79747; 194d1b7759772637caebcdb8327a4aee907ac6be; 0c58608b8baa4a99b46af752af77adf8a19410fc; cf60cf40cd878f26c83ee5d8dfeee9187a5c64fc; 71528619167ebfc394f607f8b256673ed0a4c63d; 287ec7f4a4e257578cb16ed375deec3a69c02f42; c2f107fdb83d77f854c7db92d63a867d4b01c138; f6b8a15f75a1aca641cc121f62235f8989dfcc42; a6fa2571257f95addc0e7ab58deba9371f30ad6d; 0bea93be0bc1b9b201d388a8f8c7f615b8363444; 72102d251bdb9e714b18ac54d5bc38839981194e; 9d6cb8d0ee840644c6d8fa67a77ef044376ab6cd; db55535a7a7daa79ff01960ee43cf4db8c312e1b; 967df81033e55b818a42a060539e8b99940e8d8a; 977814f53ee141b1ae86428fb8210f989b129a75; 67021c17def2dbc8702f93bfb2c38686be05b7b7; 51e4b84c4e3a19d2e2eaec01a58dec3e78f498cd; 42186bc6c436ac91a861d70a646d01d855e7497a; dba6e8b5f0637bc836465f3eb0a1cbba3b9c9ee4; f37aff0dd075646332050c63267720b2fe7ee0f2; fa5de638f2f7f40eece347da223b1a3c9f181367; df960a2d3c7e6ccbc4c4d7e0d3f35ee85f515f3d; 4d47bec57b66c32f7a0cade945e6d3bbc9a8371a; 3afd9a42f40223c25e66782d57a28a61cb29aed8; ff7c59bbc42ca6d9743397e1d79946d12bdfdb04; ea677514d793dd6b862e28af7a4aef68fff47bd6; 8608044d987e1462d12daead866a9fdf214f3a05; 59b10f9131f17daf1c4c838fb80613452dd899cf,Frontiers in Psychiatry,9,
625b3ae6ba518a81f6abce586fc4b7b950c366df,II-08 Complement receptors 1 and 2 on B cell subsets are negatively associated with lupus disease activity,"Background B cell complement receptor 1 (CR1) and complement receptor 2 (CR2) levels are decreased by âˆ¼50% in subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). CR2 but not CR1 levels have been negatively correlated with lupus disease activity. However, increased CR1 expression on B cells is associated with a protective polymorphism in the CR2 gene. We conducted a longitudinal analysis of B cell CR1 and CR2 to further evaluate an association with lupus disease activity and to determine whether it is driven by specific cell subsets. Methods Thirty-six subjects meeting the revised 1982 ACR criteria for SLE were enrolled. Each subject had a baseline visit and 1 to 4 follow up visits, with additional visits for flares. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stained with a dead cell marker and antibodies to CD19, CD27, and IgD. Antibody binding capacity (ABC) of CR1 and CR2 on live bulk and gated B cells was determined using quantitative flow cytometry (Bang Labs). The frequency of live gated B cells was determined. Disease activity was measured using SLEDAI. Statistical analyses were performed using R. To determine associations between the SLEDAI scores and gate/quadrant signals, negative binomial mixed effect models were fitted using the glmmADMB package. A random effect intercept was included to account for different individual baseline SLEDAI scores. The gate/quadrant signals, in terms of ABC and percentages, were the independent variables. Adjustments were made for age, prednisone dose, and, where relevant, bead lot. To account for multiple testing in bulk B cells, a conservative Bonferroni adjustment was used, whereas in gated cells, the p-values were adjusted to control the false discovery rate according to Benjamini-Hochberg. A p-value of â‰¤0.05 was considered significant. Results CR1 and CR2 ABC on bulk B cells and on IgD +CD27-, IgD +CD27+, and IgD-/CD27 +gated B cells was negatively associated with lupus disease activity, whereas there was no association between CR1 and CR2 ABC on IgD-/CD27- B cells or frequency of any of these gated populations and disease activity (table 1 and data not shown). Conclusions Both CR1 and CR2 levels are negatively associated with lupus disease activity in defined B cell subsets. Although this study does not prove causality, these data suggest that altered levels of these receptors on specific B cell subsets may predict disease flare or be associated with disease remission.

57660a874cfe9e8ac3cc4136ed184715484962f1,MM-Correction: Meta-analysis-Based Multiple Hypotheses Correction in Omic Studies,"The post-Genomic Era is characterized by the proliferation of high-throughput platforms that allow the parallel study of a complete body of molecules in one single run of experiments (omic approach). Analysis and integration of omic data represent one of the most challenging frontiers for all the disciplines related to Systems Biology. From the computational perspective this requires, among others, the massive use of automated approaches in several steps of the complex analysis pipeline, often consisting of cascades of statistical tests. In this frame, the identification of statistical significance has been one of the early challenges in the handling of omic data and remains a critical step due to the multiple hypotheses testing issue, given the large number of hypotheses examined at one time. Two main approaches are currently used: p-values based on random permutation approaches and the False Discovery Rate. Both give meaningful and important results, however they suffer respectively from being computationally heavy -due to the large number of data that has to be generated-, or extremely flexible with respect to the definition of the significance threshold, leading to difficulties in standardization. We present here a complementary/alternative approach to these current ones and discuss performances, properties and limitations.",2008,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Christine Nardini"", ids = ""1691060""); list(name = ""Lei Wang"", ids = ""145131956""); list(name = ""Hesen Peng"", ids = ""1766616""); list(name = ""Luca Benini"", ids = ""1710649""); list(name = ""Michael D.

69eb6925f6a9c5fa24d3072dcd048d443c4532e5,A feature selection approach to case-control genome-wide association studies,"Genome-wide association studies have become possible with the advancement of biotechnology which makes genome-wide typing of SNPs affordable. However, statistical methods for genome-wide association studies are still wanting. The multiple testing approach commonly used for genome-wide studies currently is not really appropriate. In this article, we propose a feature selection approach to genome-wide association studies. This approach consists of a screening procedure and a low-dimensional selection procedure. In the screening procedure, both main and interaction effects are screened by using a L1-penalized likelihood to reduce the number of features to a desirable low level. In the selection procedure, the retained features are ranked by a modified SCAD penalized likelihood (Fan and Li, 2001) and assessed by an extended Bayesian information criterion ( Chen and Chen, 2008). The feature selection approach is compared with a pairwise multiple testing approach recently considered by Marchini et al. (2005). It is demonstrated by simulation studies that the feature selection approach controls the false discovery rate at lower levels and achieves higher positive detection rate compared with the pairwise multiple testing approach.",2009,,"list(name = ""Jingyuan Zhao"", ids = ""1809771""); list(name = ""Zehua Chen"", ids = ""121238823"")",,d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; 40c573b3fb9eddcdc54ba2a42603ab3a2889a225; 80c74a0e0dbe2eef154151370a81bbd4cde0007c; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 1b93cb1032fdf2032c0f2e04d028c7e73f652068; 4f2c661c3b42da700c058b5177dc08339d9f2222; f8ef356045bbc63b2963e8d22a6d728122da10e6; 4958de5901f207aaadf20a3dff294926114858fa; 24779c50338d9947a3d01152cc6597ff4d240513; 6122f1e84c0dab96dc6b31659c29524f8b6f1e66; e2850cb4efd49d6808637d0257ab48ef34bcfb84; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; a8c2d0c2851afafcd8f7dd79c5c3d87b0417e917; 0efd63ecb2d9f6c7bac14890e8f2974bcc2517e6; d4b8d1308fc6490247a0a7b4fc3b38dfa151920d; d440eeaf5a78af05fee03adc77c802332e44a615; 24aa16df87fcfdb540b13fa9b7007f4d95cbcf7f; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 88a2f5129a01f5a7b1a2bb4e802d046822f65a39; 0ddf2646929ce22bb189ef0e6232fcea4e5404c2; b77a86b4786666510a1372fecc0d1cc3c824f843,,,
8c6cff6b3928fe0ca562c03bc811fb3b238e5726,Copy number variations and genome-wide associations reveal putative genes and metabolic pathways involved with the feed conversion ratio in beef cattle,"The use of genome-wide association results combined with other genomic approaches may uncover genes and metabolic pathways related to complex traits. In this study, the phenotypic and genotypic data of 1475 Nellore (Bos indicus) cattle and 941,033 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used for genome-wide association study (GWAS) and copy number variations (CNVs) analysis in order to identify candidate genes and putative pathways involved with the feed conversion ratio (FCR). The GWAS was based on the Bayes B approach analyzing genomic windows with multiple regression models to estimate the proportion of genetic variance explained by each window. The CNVs were detected with PennCNV software using the log R ratio and B allele frequency data. CNV regions (CNVRs) were identified with CNVRuler and a linear regression was used to associate CNVRs and the FCR. Functional annotation of associated genomic regions was performed with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and the metabolic pathways were obtained from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). We showed five genomic windows distributed over chromosomes 4, 6, 7, 8, and 24 that explain 12Â % of the total genetic variance for FCR, and detected 12 CNVRs (chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 10, and 12) significantly associated [false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05] with the FCR. Significant genomic regions (GWAS and CNV) harbor candidate genes involved in pathways related to energetic, lipid, and protein metabolism. The metabolic pathways found in this study are related to processes directly connected to feed efficiency in beef cattle. It was observed that, even though different genomic regions and genes were found between the two approaches (GWAS and CNV), the metabolic processes covered were related to each other. Therefore, a combination of the approaches complement each other and lead to a better understanding of the FCR.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""M. H. A.

b1638b86dfc8b780cbabee259af3724d84a52ecf,Integrated genome-wide analysis of expression quantitative trait loci aids interpretation of genomic association studies,"BackgroundIdentification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with gene expression levels, known as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), may improve understanding of the functional role of phenotype-associated SNPs in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The small sample sizes of some previous eQTL studies have limited their statistical power. We conducted an eQTL investigation of microarray-based gene and exon expression levels in whole blood in a cohort of 5257 individuals, exceeding the single cohort size of previous studies by more than a factor of 2.ResultsWe detected over 19,000 independent lead cis-eQTLs and over 6000 independent lead trans-eQTLs, targeting over 10,000 gene targets (eGenes), with a false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰5%. Of previously published significant GWAS SNPs, 48% are identified to be significant eQTLs in our study. Some trans-eQTLs point toward novel mechanistic explanations for the association of the SNP with the GWAS-related phenotype. We also identify 59 distinct blocks or clusters of trans-eQTLs, each targeting the expression of sets of six to 229 distinct trans-eGenes. Ten of these sets of target genes are significantly enriched for microRNA targets (FDRâ€‰<â€‰5%). Many of these clusters are associated in GWAS with multiple phenotypes.ConclusionsThese findings provide insights into the molecular regulatory patterns involved in human physiology and pathophysiology. We illustrate the value of our eQTL database in the context of a recent GWAS meta-analysis of coronary artery disease and provide a list of targeted eGenes for 21 of 58 GWAS loci.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Roby Joehanes"", ids = ""2770659""); list(name = ""Xiaoling Zhang"", ids = ""1724720""); list(name = ""Tianxiao Huan"", ids = ""2789524""); list(name = ""Chen Yao"", ids = ""47559014""); list(name = ""Saixia Ying"", ids = ""39157135""); list(name = ""Quang Tri Nguyen"", ids = ""144938862""); list(name = ""Cumhur Yusuf Demirkale"", ids = ""3881757""); list(name = ""Michael Feolo"", ids = ""34189475""); list(name = ""Nataliya Sharopova"", ids = ""1873627""); list(name = ""Anne Sturcke"", ids = ""3392172""); list(name = ""Alejandro A.

110bba4120067690ac356d336ee94efca37df197,Abstract 3318: Using synthetic lethal screening to identify therapeutic targets for innately platinum resistant lung cancer,"Proceedings: AACR Annual Meeting 2014; April 5-9, 2014; San Diego, CA

Although platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for most cases of advanced lung adenocarcinoma, its effectiveness is limited by the frequent incidence of innate chemoresistance. As a result, response rates rarely exceed 20%, even though cis-platinum and carboplatin are highly effective in other settings such as small cell lung, ovarian and testicular cancers. We hypothesized that innate chemoresistance in lung adenocarcinoma is mediated by one or more signalling pathways dependent on the expression of a single gene, and that these pathways could ultimately be targeted therapeutically. To address this question, we developed a synthetic-lethal high throughput siRNA screen using the innately resistant A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line. Optimisation of the screen was performed using a siRNA death control (PLK1), which induced cell death in the absence of platinum, and a sensitization control (MTOR), which enhanced cell death only in combination with a sublethal concentration of carboplatin. These independent controls revealed that the screening protocol performed within acceptable limits of variability, quality and reproducibility as determined by Zâ€™ factor analysis. Screening was then performed using a pool of four siRNAs targeting a single gene in conjunction with vehicle treatment, or with carboplatin. After screening siRNAs targeting the 720 kinases, 256 phosphatases and 4794 â€œdruggableâ€ targets of the human genome, we identified 50 candidate targets based on fold change difference between platinum and vehicle treatments, and statistical significance determined by multiple t-test corrected for false discovery rate. Preliminary integrated pathway analysis of RNA expression array and screening datasets revealed a highly significant enrichment of sensitizing genes in previously identified pathways as well as novel pathways. These data demonstrate that a synthetic-lethal approach can be used to identify therapeutic targets that could potentially sensitize lung adenocarcinoma to platinum-based chemotherapy.

0c94ae6856907dfa55e1027c27796b9c0779e263,Powerful differential expression analysis incorporating network topology for nextâ€generation sequencing data,"Motivation: RNAâ€seq has become the technology of choice for interrogating the transcriptome. However, most methods for RNAâ€seq differential expression (DE) analysis do not utilize prior knowledge of biological networks to detect DE genes. With the increased availability and quality of biological network databases, methods that can utilize this prior knowledge are needed and will offer biologists with a viable, more powerful alternative when analyzing RNAâ€seq data. Results: We propose a threeâ€state Markov Random Field (MRF) method that utilizes known biological pathways and interaction to improve sensitivity and specificity and therefore reducing false discovery rates (FDRs) when detecting differentially expressed genes from RNAâ€seq data. The method requires normalized count data (e.g. in Fragments or Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM/RPKM) format) as its input and it is implemented in an R package pathDESeq available from Github. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms the twoâ€state MRF model for various sample sizes. Furthermore, for a comparable FDR, it has better sensitivity than DESeq, EBSeq, edgeR and NOISeq. The proposed method also picks more top Gene Ontology terms and KEGG pathways terms when applied to real dataset from colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma studies, respectively. Overall, these findings clearly highlight the power of our method relative to the existing methods that do not utilize prior knowledge of biological network.

179e73e21d66fdfb97aa110ebe90c24970f2328e,Ethanol activates immune response in lymphoblastoid cells.,"The short-term effects of alcohol on gene expression in brain tissue cannot directly be studied in humans. Because neuroimmune signaling is altered by alcohol, immune cells are a logical, accessible choice to study and may provide biomarkers. RNAseq was used to study the effects of 48-h exposure to ethanol on lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 20 alcoholic subjects and 20 control subjects. Ethanol exposure resulted in differential expression of 4456 of the 12,503 genes detectably expressed in the LCLs (FDR [false discovery rate]Â â‰¤Â 0.05); 52% of these showed increased expression. Cells from alcoholic subjects and control subjects responded similarly. The genes whose expression changed fell into many pathways: NFÎºB, neuroinflammation, IL6, IL2, IL8, and dendritic cell maturation pathways were activated, consistent with increased signaling by NFÎºB, TNF, IL1, IL4, IL18, TLR4, and LPS. Signaling by Interferons A and B decreased, as did EIF2 signaling, phospholipase C signaling, and glycolysis. Baseline gene expression patterns were similar in LCLs from alcoholic subjects and control subjects. At relaxed stringency (pÂ <Â 0.05), 465 genes differed, 230 of which were also affected by ethanol. There was a suggestion of compensation because baseline differences (no ethanol) were in the opposite direction of differences due to ethanol exposure in 78% of these genes. Pathways with IL8, phospholipase C, and Î±-adrenergic signaling were significant. The pattern of expression was consistent with increased signaling by several cytokines, including interferons, TLR2, and TLR3 in alcoholics. Expression of genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, including the rate-limiting enzyme HMGCR, was lower in alcoholic subjects. LCLs show many effects of ethanol exposure, some of which might provide biomarkers for alcohol use disorders. Identifying genes and pathways altered by ethanol can aid in interpreting which genes within loci identified by GWAS might play functional roles.",2019,Psychology; Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Jeanette N.

2bf88b4904dae232d033dd7c7a2a4c75fa4c8ace,A nonparametric empirical Bayes framework for large-scale multiple testing.,"We propose a flexible and identifiable version of the 2-groups model, motivated by hierarchical Bayes considerations, that features an empirical null and a semiparametric mixture model for the nonnull cases. We use a computationally efficient predictive recursion (PR) marginal likelihood procedure to estimate the model parameters, even the nonparametric mixing distribution. This leads to a nonparametric empirical Bayes testing procedure, which we call PRtest, based on thresholding the estimated local false discovery rates. Simulations and real data examples demonstrate that, compared to existing approaches, PRtest's careful handling of the nonnull density can give a much better fit in the tails of the mixture distribution which, in turn, can lead to more realistic conclusions.",2012,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ryan Martin"", ids = ""145420397""); list(name = ""Surya T.

7076503d1d6f0ae7a14c5613a5c6a8a7f6ee2eef,Deterministic Multiple Change-Point Detection with Limited Communication,"Large-scale sensor networks are used in modern applications to perform statistical inference. In particular, multiple change-point detection using a sensor network is of interest in applications, such as Internet of Things and environmental monitoring. In this paper, we consider deterministic multiple change-point detection using a sensor network, in which each sensor observes a different data stream and communicates with a fusion center (FC). Due to communication limitations, the fusion center monitors only a subset of the sensors at each time slot. We propose a detection procedure that takes into account these limitations. In this procedure, the FC monitors the sensors with the highest cumulative sum values under the communication limitations. It is shown that the proposed procedure is scalable in the sense that it attains an average detection delay (ADD) that does not increase with the number of sensors, while controlling the false discovery rate. Using the proposed procedure, we identify and analyze the tradeoff between reducing the ADD and reducing the average number of observations drawn until the change-points are declared.",2020,,"list(name = ""Eyal Nitzan"", ids = ""144469677""); list(name = ""Topi Halme"", ids = ""46200267""); list(name = ""H.

604e95fc5178a28fa6f17cf08453aeb6ce5bcef0,Measuring Cigarette Smoking-Induced Cortical Dopamine Release: A [11C]FLB-457 PET Study,"Striatal dopamine (DA) is thought to have a fundamental role in the reinforcing effects of tobacco smoking and nicotine. Microdialysis studies indicate that nicotine also increases DA in extrastriatal brain areas, but much less is known about its role in addiction. High-affinity D2/3 receptor radiotracers permit the measurement of cortical DA in humans using positron emission tomography (PET). [11C]FLB-457 PET scans were conducted in 10 nicotine-dependent daily smokers after overnight abstinence and reinstatement of smoking. Voxel-wise [11C]-FLB-457-binding potential (BPND) in the frontal lobe, insula, and limbic regions was estimated in the two conditions. Paired t-tests showed BPND values were reduced following smoking (an indirect index of DA release). The overall peak t was located in the cingulate gyrus, which was part of a larger medial cluster (BPND change âˆ’12.1Â±9.4%) and this survived false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons. Clusters were also identified in the left anterior cingulate cortex/medial frontal gyrus, bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), bilateral amygdala, and the left insula. This is the first demonstration of tobacco smoking-induced cortical DA release in humans; it may be the result of both pharmacological (nicotine) and non-pharmacological factors (tobacco cues). Abstinence increased craving but had minimal cognitive effects, thus limiting correlation analyses.

087d754018ebcb828a0e10de058e2a021441abab,Structure Learning from Time Series with False Discovery Control,"We consider the Granger causal structure learning problem from time series data. Granger causal algorithms predict a 'Granger causal effect' between two variables by testing if prediction error of one decreases significantly in the absence of the other variable among the predictor covariates. Almost all existing Granger causal algorithms condition on a large number of variables (all but two variables) to test for effects between a pair of variables. We propose a new structure learning algorithm called MMPC-p inspired by the well known MMHC algorithm for non-time series data. We show that under some assumptions, the algorithm provides false discovery rate control. The algorithm is sound and complete when given access to perfect directed information testing oracles. We also outline a novel tester for the linear Gaussian case. We show through our extensive experiments that the MMPC-p algorithm scales to larger problems and has improved statistical power compared to existing state of the art for large sparse graphs.

We extend to this setting the notion of false discovery rate (FDR) as a measure of type I error. Our main result studies specific procedures based on the observation of the $p$-value process. Control of the FDR at a nominal level is ensured either under arbitrary dependence of $p$-values, or under the assumption that the finite dimensional distributions of the $p$-value process have positive correlations of a specific type (weak PRDS). Both cases generalize existing results established in the finite setting, the latter one leading to a less conservative procedure.

67fd9043b2625a01d7b3e954734f0b3ca6546365,Semi-parametric Covariate-modulated Local False Discovery Rate for Genome-wide Association Studies,"While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered thousands of risk loci for heritable disorders, so far even very large meta-analyses have recovered only a fraction of the heritability of most complex traits. Recent work utilizing variance components models has demonstrated that a larger fraction of the heritability of complex phenotypes is captured by the additive effects of SNPs than is evident only in loci surpassing genome-wide significance thresholds, typically set at a Bonferroni-inspired p â‰¤ 5 x 10-8. Procedures that control false discovery rate can be more powerful, yet these are still under-powered to detect the majority of non-null effects from GWAS. The current work proposes a novel Bayesian semi-parametric two-group mixture model and develops a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for a covariate-modulated local false discovery rate (cmfdr). The probability of being non-null depends on a set of covariates via a logistic function, and the non-null distribution is approximated as a linear combination of B-spline densities, where the weight of each B-spline density depends on a multinomial function of the covariates. The proposed methods were motivated by work on a large meta-analysis of schizophrenia GWAS performed by the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC). We show that the new cmfdr model fits the PGC schizophrenia GWAS test statistics well, performing better than our previously proposed parametric gamma model for estimating the non-null density and substantially improving power over usual fdr. Using loci declared significant at cmfdr â‰¤ 0.20, we perform follow-up pathway analyses using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) homo sapiens pathways database. We demonstrate that the increased yield from the cmfdr model results in an improved ability to test for pathways associated with schizophrenia compared to using those SNPs selected according to usual fdr.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Rong W.

28b29ba8db35f001b33240676e3093f8cc73c27f,"Towards ""simultaneous selective inference"": post-hoc bounds on the false discovery proportion","The false discovery rate (FDR) has become a popular Type-I error criterion for multiple testing, but it is not without its flaws. Indeed, (a) controlling the mean of the false discovery proportion (FDP) does not preclude large FDP variability, and (b) committing to an error level $q$ before observing the data limits its use in exploratory data analysis. We take a step towards addressing both of the above drawbacks by proving uniform FDP bounds for a variety of existing FDR procedures. In particular, many such procedures proceed by examining a $\textit{path}$ of potential rejection sets $\varnothing = \mathcal R_0 \subseteq \mathcal R_1 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq \mathcal R_n \subseteq [n]$, assigning an estimate $\widehat{\text{FDP}}(\mathcal R_k)$ to each one, and choosing the final rejection set $\mathcal R_{k^*}$ via $k^* = \max\{k: \widehat{\text{FDP}}(\mathcal R_k) \leq q\}$. We prove that for a wide variety of such procedures (including Benjamini-Hochberg), under independent p-values, $\widehat{\text{FDP}}$ bounds the FDP to within a small explicit constant factor $c_{\text{alg}}(\alpha)$, uniformly across the entire path, with probability $1-\alpha$. This constant is close to 2 for several procedures at the 95% confidence level. These bounds imply that existing FDR procedures also have FDP bounded with high probability by a small constant multiple of the target FDR level $q$. Our bounds also open up a middle ground between fully simultaneous inference and fully selective inference.

Chronic exposure to arsenic in drinking water is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear.


OBJECTIVES
This study evaluated the interaction between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes associated with diabetes and arsenic exposure in drinking water on the risk of developing T2DM.


METHODS
In 2009-2011, we conducted a follow up study of 957 Bangladeshi adults who participated in a case-control study of arsenic-induced skin lesions in 2001-2003. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between 38 SNPs in 18 genes and risk of T2DM measured at follow up. T2DM was defined as having a blood hemoglobin A1C level greater than or equal to 6.5% at follow-up. Arsenic exposure was characterized by drinking water samples collected from participants' tubewells. False discovery rates were applied in the analysis to control for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
Median arsenic levels in 2001-2003 were higher among diabetic participants compared with non-diabetic ones (71.6 Âµg/L vs. 12.5 Âµg/L, p-value <0.001). Three SNPs in ADAMTS9 were nominally associated with increased risk of T2DM (rs17070905, Odds Ratio (OR) â€Š=â€Š2.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-4.50; rs17070967, ORâ€Š=â€Š2.02, 95%CI 1.00-4.06; rs6766801, ORâ€Š=â€Š2.33, 95%CI 1.18-4.60), but these associations did not reach the statistical significance after adjusting for multiple comparisons. A significant interaction between arsenic and NOTCH2 (rs699780) was observed which significantly increased the risk of T2DM (p for interactionâ€Š=â€Š0.003; q-valueâ€Š=â€Š0.021). Further restricted analysis among participants exposed to water arsenic of less than 148 Âµg/L showed consistent results for interaction between the NOTCH2 variant and arsenic exposure on T2DM (p for interaction â€Š=â€Š0.048; q-valueâ€Š=â€Š0.004).


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that genetic variation in NOTCH2 increased susceptibility to T2DM among people exposed to inorganic arsenic. Additionally, genetic variants in ADAMTS9 may increase the risk of T2DM.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wen-Chi Pan"", ids = ""3421379""); list(name = ""Molly L.

8b86981689695c92f1e47590a9736899bb380e71,Joint analysis of multiple high-dimensional data types using sparse matrix approximations of rank-1 with applications to ovarian and liver cancer,"BackgroundTechnological advances enable the cost-effective acquisition of Multi-Modal Data Sets (MMDS) composed of measurements for multiple, high-dimensional data types obtained from a common set of bio-samples. The joint analysis of the data matrices associated with the different data types of a MMDS should provide a more focused view of the biology underlying complex diseases such as cancer that would not be apparent from the analysis of a single data type alone. As multi-modal data rapidly accumulate in research laboratories and public databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the translation of such data into clinically actionable knowledge has been slowed by the lack of computational tools capable of analyzing MMDSs. Here, we describe the Joint Analysis of Many Matrices by ITeration (JAMMIT) algorithm that jointly analyzes the data matrices of a MMDS using sparse matrix approximations of rank-1.MethodsThe JAMMIT algorithm jointly approximates an arbitrary number of data matrices by rank-1 outer-products composed of â€œsparseâ€ left-singular vectors (eigen-arrays) that are unique to each matrix and a right-singular vector (eigen-signal) that is common to all the matrices. The non-zero coefficients of the eigen-arrays identify small subsets of variables for each data type (i.e., signatures) that in aggregate, or individually, best explain a dominant eigen-signal defined on the columns of the data matrices. The approximation is specified by a single â€œsparsityâ€ parameter that is selected based on false discovery rate estimated by permutation testing. Multiple signals of interest in a given MDDS are sequentially detected and modeled by iterating JAMMIT on â€œresidualâ€ data matrices that result from a given sparse approximation.ResultsWe show that JAMMIT outperforms other joint analysis algorithms in the detection of multiple signatures embedded in simulated MDDS. On real multimodal data for ovarian and liver cancer we show that JAMMIT identified multi-modal signatures that were clinically informative and enriched for cancer-related biology.ConclusionsSparse matrix approximations of rank-1 provide a simple yet effective means of jointly reducing multiple, big data types to a small subset of variables that characterize important clinical and/or biological attributes of the bio-samples from which the data were acquired.",2016,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gordon Okimoto"", ids = ""1816225""); list(name = ""Ashkan Zeinalzadeh"", ids = ""3003348""); list(name = ""Tom Wenska"", ids = ""3156535""); list(name = ""Michael Loomis"", ids = ""144074390""); list(name = ""James B.

Following extensive quality control, we adaptively combined methylation measures for neighboring, highly-correlated CpGs into 4 344 016 CpG blocks with which we performed association testing. Eleven age-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) passed Bonferroni correction (P-value < 1.15 Ã— 10(-8)). Top findings replicated in an independent sample set of 558 subjects using pyrosequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA (min P-value < 10(-30)). To examine biological themes, we selected 70 DMRs with false discovery rate of <0.1. Of these, 42 showed hypomethylation and 28 showed hypermethylation with age. Hypermethylated DMRs were more likely to overlap with CpG islands and shores. Hypomethylated DMRs were more likely to be in regions associated with polycomb/regulatory proteins (e.g. EZH2) or histone modifications H3K27ac, H3K4m1, H3K4m2, H3K4m3 and H3K9ac. Among genes implicated by the top DMRs were protocadherins, homeobox genes, MAPKs and ryanodine receptors. Several of our DMRs are at genes with potential relevance for age-related disease. This study successfully demonstrates the application of next-generation sequencing to MWAS, by interrogating a large proportion of the methylome and returning potentially novel age DMRs, in addition to replicating several loci implicated in previous studies using microarrays.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Joseph L.

77519a2ddf3550f0ae38f44f4dab7b897bfe33f1,Knockdown of Zinc Transporter ZIP12 by shRNA Alters Genes Related to Mitochondria and Neuronal Differentiation in Neuro-2a Cells (P24-018-19).,"Objectives
Zinc is vital for brain function and preservation of cognitive potential in aging. However, mechanisms by which the nervous system regulates zinc homeostasis are poorly understood. Hence, this study determined changes in gene expression due to the loss of ZIP12 in Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells.


Methods
We used RNA-sequencing to uncover differentially expressed genes between cells transfected with a control short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and cells transfected with a shRNA targeting the ZIP12 mRNA sequence. Cells were transfected with NeuroMag (Oz Biosciences) (nÂ =Â 6) in 6-well plates and differentiated with all-trans retinoic acid in reduced serum DMEM media for 48 hours. RNA libraries were prepared from total RNA (RNA integrity numberÂ >8.0) using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit. Single-end 75 bp reads were generated on an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer. A transcriptome analysis pipeline including Trimmomatic, HISAT2, featureCounts, and DESeq2 was used to identify differentially expressed genes. The cutoff for differential expression was set at log2 fold change of 0.584962, corresponding to a 0.5x increase or decrease in expression relative to control.


Results
25 genes were found which met this cutoff, and all 25 genes had a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 1.0Â Ã—Â 10-9. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), we determined that differentially expressed genes (both upregulated and downregulated) were enriched for mitochondria-related function. These mitochondria-related genes include alcohol dehydrogenase-5, peroxiredoxin-3, and galectin-3, and translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 8 homolog A, and these genes were more likely to be upregulated. Manual identification of genes important for neuronal differentiation in downregulated genes included dopamine beta hydroxylase, astrotactin-2, neural zinc finger-3, neuron specific gene family member-2, inhibitor of DNA binding-2, and inhibitor of DNA binding-3.


Conclusions
These findings indicate that changes in the transcriptome induced by loss of ZIP12 function may contribute impairments in neuronal function and reflect altered mitochondrial function.

47cb879523133b5829251eb73a5d8c094b52b414,Research on the molecular mechanism of Seretide treatment to asthma disease.,"INTRODUCTION
Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. It is attributable to complicated coactions between various genetic factors and environmental allergens.


AIM
We attempt to unfold the mechanism of asthmatic disorder and research the molecular mechanism of Seretide on asthmatic disease.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Using the GSE31773 microarray datasets downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database, we first screened the differentially expressed genes between healthy control and asthmatic samples cells based on classical t-test and false discovery rate < 0.05 as significant threshold. The underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis. In addition, the crosstalk network of pathways was also constructed.


RESULTS
A total of 2011 differentially expressed genes were obtained by comparing asthmatic sample treated with Seretide and healthy controls. A total of 403 differentially expressed genes were collected between asthma samples untreated by Seretide and healthy sample controls. The enriched pathway of differentially expressed genes included signal transduction disorder (such as TGF-beta signaling pathway) and metabolism disorder (such as Phenylalanine metabolism).

31394c1a023cd8aa5b7a9c65479c150185308523,Predicting nsSNPs that Disrupt Protein-Protein Interactions Using Docking,"The human genome contains a large number of protein polymorphisms due to individual genome variation. How many of these polymorphisms lead to altered protein-protein interaction is unknown. We have developed a method to address this question. The intersection of the SKEMPI database (of affinity constants among interacting proteins) and CAPRI 4.0 docking benchmark was docked using HADDOCK, leading to a training set of 166 mutant pairs. A random forest classifier based on the differences in resulting docking scores between the 166 mutant pairs and their wild-types was used, to distinguish between variants that have either completely or partially lost binding ability. Fifty percent of non-binders were correctly predicted with a false discovery rate of only 2 percent. The model was tested on a set of 15 HIV-1 â€“ human, as well as seven human- human glioblastoma-related, mutant protein pairs: 50 percent of combined non-binders were correctly predicted with a false discovery rate of 10 percent. The model was also used to identify 10 protein-protein interactions between human proteins and their HIV-1 partners that are likely to be abolished by rare non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs).

Advantages of sequencing-based transcriptional profiling over microarrays have been reported, including lower technical variability. However, advances in technology do not remove biological variation between replicates and this variation is often neglected in many analyses.ResultsWe propose an empirical Bayes method, titled Analysis of Sequence Counts (ASC), to detect differential expression based on sequencing technology. ASC borrows information across sequences to establish prior distribution of sample variation, so that biological variation can be accounted for even when replicates are not available. Compared to current approaches that simply tests for equality of proportions in two samples, ASC is less biased towards highly expressed sequences and can identify more genes with a greater log fold change at lower overall abundance.ConclusionsASC unifies the biological and statistical significance of differential expression by estimating the posterior mean of log fold change and estimating false discovery rates based on the posterior mean.

Falciani (Birmingham, UK) used relevance networks to model the interaction between tumour cells and normal cells in prostate cancer. Crosstalk is thought to influence many important aspects of tumour biology. Falciani has developed a strategy to identify new genes that are involved in this crosstalk on the basis of gene-expression profiling and statistical modelling. The analysis revealed several genes, such as the repulsive factor Slit-2, that have a potential role in tumour growth and metastasis formation, and these have been verified experimentally. Conclusion During this workshop, numerous topics were discussed, ranging from data preprocessing to machine-learning approaches. Many challenges are still being faced with regard to the proper annotation of both the material-processing steps and the genes themselves. New insights are also being gained with respect to data normalization and preprocessing, in which methods to deal with changes in global mRNA expression and ratio statistics allow gene-expression changes to be measured more accurately. The talk dealing with cisregulatory module detection showed that more sophisticated methods are available for this task, which are able to address large non-compact genomes. During the network session, it became clear that many challenges still exist in this area. Important aspects of how to deal with large data sets, different data qualities and different types of data are actively being explored. Progress has already been made in many of these areas and should continue in the future, with new developments and technologies becoming available. From this workshop, it was clear that the interplay between different areas of expertise will have a crucial role in advancing our understanding of biological processes.

0812b1a73e0ab8570a77549cebc1f3f764da6405,Systematic evaluation of differential splicing tools for RNA-seq studies.,"Differential splicing (DS) is a post-transcriptional biological process with critical, wide-ranging effects on a plethora of cellular activities and disease processes. To date, a number of computational approaches have been developed to identify and quantify differentially spliced genes from RNA-seq data, but a comprehensive intercomparison and appraisal of these approaches is currently lacking. In this study, we systematically evaluated 10 DS analysis tools for consistency and reproducibility, precision, recall and false discovery rate, agreement upon reported differentially spliced genes and functional enrichment. The tools were selected to represent the three different methodological categories: exon-based (DEXSeq, edgeR, JunctionSeq, limma), isoform-based (cuffdiff2, DiffSplice) and event-based methods (dSpliceType, MAJIQ, rMATS, SUPPA). Overall, all the exon-based methods and two event-based methods (MAJIQ and rMATS) scored well on the selected measures. Of the 10 tools tested, the exon-based methods performed generally better than the isoform-based and event-based methods. However, overall, the different data analysis tools performed strikingly differently across different data sets or numbers of samples.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Arfa Mehmood"", ids = ""26394364""); list(name = ""Asta Laiho"", ids = ""47328155""); list(name = ""Mikko S VenÃ¤lÃ¤inen"", ids = ""47545810""); list(name = ""Aidan J McGlinchey"", ids = ""51045455""); list(name = ""Ning Wang"", ids = ""1444684446""); list(name = ""Laura L.

7887c7678424bbf8cc8a542732f780f2227e248d,A protein probability model for high-throughput protein identification by mass spectrometry-based proteomics.,"Shotgun proteomics is the method of choice for high-throughput protein identification; however, robust statistical methods are essential to automatize this task while minimizing the number of false identifications. The standard method for estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) of individual identifications and keeping it below a threshold (typically 1%) is the target-decoy approach. However, numerous works have shown that FDR at protein level may become much larger than FDR at peptide level. The development of an appropriate scoring model to identify proteins from their peptides using high-throughput shotgun proteomics is highly needed. In this study, we present a novel protein-level scoring algorithm that uses the scores of the identified peptides and maintains all the properties expected for a true protein probability. We also present a refinement of the picked method to calculate FDR at the protein level. These algorithms can be used together as a robust identification workflow suitable for large-scale proteomics, and we show that the identification performance of this workflow is superior to that of other widely-used methods in several samples and using different search engines. Our protein probability model offers the scientific community an algorithm easy to integrate into protein identification workflows for the automated analysis of shotgun proteomics data.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gorka Prieto"", ids = ""38228179""); list(name = ""JesÃºs VÃ¡zquez"", ids = ""152495293"")",,,Journal of proteome research,,
520096900c4147bca4d134538e26df79eef10e72,Genome-wide search for replicable risk gene regions in alcohol and nicotine co-dependence.,"The present study searched for replicable risk genomic regions for alcohol and nicotine co-dependence using a genome-wide association strategy. The data contained a total of 3,143 subjects including 818 European-American (EA) cases with alcohol and nicotine co-dependence, 1,396 EA controls, 449 African-American (AA) cases, and 480 AA controls. We performed separate genome-wide association analyses in EAs and AAs and a meta-analysis to derive combined P-values, and calculated the genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR) for each SNP. Regions with P < 5 Ã— 10(-7) together with FDR < 0.05 in the meta-analysis were examined to detect all replicable risk SNPs across EAs, AAs, and meta-analysis. These SNPs were followed with a series of functional expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses. We found a unique genome-wide significant gene region--SH3BP5-NR2C2--that was enriched with 11 replicable risk SNPs for alcohol and nicotine co-dependence. The distributions of -log(P) values for all SNP-disease associations within this region were consistent across EAs, AAs, and meta-analysis (0.315 â‰¤ r â‰¤ 0.868; 8.1 Ã— 10(-52) â‰¤ P â‰¤ 3.6 Ã— 10(-5)). In the meta-analysis, this region was the only association peak throughout chromosome 3 at P < 0.0001. All replicable risk markers available for eQTL analysis had nominal cis- and trans-acting regulatory effects on gene expression. The transcript expression of the genes in this region was regulated partly by several nicotine dependence (ND)-related genes and significantly correlated with transcript expression of many alcohol dependence- and ND-related genes. We concluded that the SH3BP5-NR2C2 region on Chromosome 3 might harbor causal loci for alcohol and nicotine co-dependence.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Lingjun Zuo"", ids = ""40603529""); list(name = ""Fengyu Zhang"", ids = ""1812007""); list(name = ""Heping Zhang"", ids = ""49724423""); list(name = ""Xiangyang Zhang"", ids = ""3094137""); list(name = ""Fei Wang"", ids = ""145412046""); list(name = ""Chiang-shan Ray Li"", ids = ""1684484""); list(name = ""Lingeng Lu"", ids = ""144085926""); list(name = ""Jiang Hong"", ids = ""144585095""); list(name = ""Lin Lu"", ids = ""145139362""); list(name = ""John H.

c528be38de9dbf2eca2c92d05161c13f0d2bbb0b,Integrative Bayesian analysis of neuroimaging-genetic data with application to cocaine dependence,"Neuroimaging and genetic studies provide distinct and complementary information about the structural and biological aspects of a disease. Integrating the two sources of data facilitates the investigation of the links between genetic variability and brain mechanisms among different individuals for various medical disorders. This article presents a general statistical framework for integrative Bayesian analysis of neuroimaging-genetic (iBANG) data, which is motivated by a neuroimaging-genetic study in cocaine dependence. Statistical inference necessitated the integration of spatially dependent voxel-level measurements with various patient-level genetic and demographic characteristics under an appropriate probability model to account for the multiple inherent sources of variation. Our framework uses Bayesian model averaging to integrate genetic information into the analysis of voxel-wise neuroimaging data, accounting for spatial correlations in the voxels. Using multiplicity controls based on the false discovery rate, we delineate voxels associated with genetic and demographic features that may impact diffusion as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) obtained from DTI images. We demonstrate the benefits of accounting for model uncertainties in both model fit and prediction. Our results suggest that cocaine consumption is associated with FA reduction in most white matter regions of interest in the brain.

bc2bd40bf9a1fe09d3b8cb6dc4cc6d43e95129ee,Estimation of False Discovery Rate in Microarray Data Analysis : a Comparative Study,"Topic area of the submission: Recent developments in transcriptome-oriented biotechnologies have made possible the comparative analysis of thousands of genes expression changes in parallel. These data usually consist in the measurement of gene expression under various biological conditions that can potentially provide information on the complex transcriptional activity for the biological system [1]. In such conditions, questions raised by research scientists relate to class comparison, class prediction and class discovery problems. Concerning class comparison, the aim is to select relevant genes the transcriptional changes of which are related to a clinical or biological outcome. In such a case, a major multiplicity problem arises that leads to a renewed interest for multiple comparison procedures taking into account false positives. Until now, statistical procedures have mostly relied on the multiple testing framework in order to control false positive conclusions. In this framework, two quantities have been considered: the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) and the False Discovery Rate (FDR). The FWER, which is the oldest criterion considered in multiple comparisons, is defined as the probability of at least one false positive conclusion over all the true null hypotheses (a null hypothesis corresponds to the lack of relationship between gene expression measurement and a response variable). The most commonly used methods are the Bonferroni and SidÃ£k methods [2]. Extension of these two methods are based on step-down [3] or step-up principles where null hypotheses are tested sequentially [2]. In complement to the previous methods, resampling (or permutation based) procedures that make no distributional hypothesis but incorporate correlation structures and distributional characteristics (for a review see [4]) have been developed and applied to microarray gene expression study [5][6][7].",2004,,"list(name = ""Philippe BroÃ«t"", ids = ""3170825"")",,0e7fd9422eaa403b80d708588d48b7d98abe5d63; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; dfc3facf3a95c9df6cc4b5edf7c982dd9e5b1438; d42337ecab378287fbcd60b42e5ceb5b67b6f59a; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 256f29267c2317228f6a7b65d698326f0a285e36; 6cd45f7034f5bd148c225a477412bfbe18fee0b6; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; f628674ca6108606f9fc50a187510d92be334273,,,
a097baf4b7413d2929171bfa3c4fc7f7e0ceef53,Genome-wide association study identifies two novel loci containing FLNB and SBF2 genes underlying stature variation.,"Human stature, as an important physical index in clinical practice and a usual covariate in gene mapping of complex disorders, is a highly heritable complex trait. To identify specific genes underlying stature, a genome-wide association study was performed in 1000 unrelated homogeneous Caucasian subjects using Affymetrix 500K arrays. A group of seven contiguous markers in the region of SBF2 gene (Set-binding factor 2) are associated with stature, significantly so at the genome-wide level after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (FDR q = 0.034-0.042). Three SNPs in another SNP group in the Filamin B (FLNB) gene were also associated with stature, significantly so with FDR q = 0.042-0.048. In follow-up independent replication studies, rs10734652 in the SBF2 gene was significantly (P = 0.036) and suggestively (P = 0.07) associated with stature in Caucasian families and 1306 unrelated Caucasian subjects, respectively, and rs9834312 in the FLNB gene was also associated with stature in such two independent Caucasian populations (P = 0.008 in unrelated sample and P = 0.049 in family sample). Particularly, additional significant replication association signals were detected in Chinese, an ethnic population different from Caucasian, between rs9834312 and stature in 619 unrelated northern Chinese subjects (P = 0.017), as well as between rs10734652 and stature in 2953 unrelated southern Chinese subjects (P = 0.048). This study also provides additional replication evidence for some of the already published stature loci. These results, together with the known functional relevance of the SBF2 and FLNB genes to skeletal linear growth and bone formation, support that two regions containing FLNB and SBF2 genes are two novel loci underlying stature variation.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shufeng Lei"", ids = ""2276400""); list(name = ""Li-jun Tan"", ids = ""2668355""); list(name = ""Xiao-gang Liu"", ids = ""38066027""); list(name = ""Liang Wang"", ids = ""48169685""); list(name = ""Han Yan"", ids = ""145341032""); list(name = ""Yan-Fang Guo"", ids = ""1991040""); list(name = ""Yao-zhong Liu"", ids = ""7137552""); list(name = ""Dong-hai Xiong"", ids = ""2498689""); list(name = ""Jian Li"", ids = ""47786251""); list(name = ""Tie-Lin Yang"", ids = ""80245379""); list(name = ""Xiang-ding Chen"", ids = ""2259300""); list(name = ""Yan Guo"", ids = ""46791107""); list(name = ""Fei-Yan Deng"", ids = ""144184148""); list(name = ""Yin-Ping Zhang"", ids = ""2023188""); list(name = ""Xue-zhen Zhu"", ids = ""8362120""); list(name = ""Shawn Levy"", ids = ""47773959""); list(name = ""Christopher J.

4eec164fea889cd17841eefe38de7d48e37250a7,Influence of various endogenous and artefact modifications on large-scale proteomics analysis.,"RATIONALE
Some large-scale proteomics studies in which strong cation exchange chromatography has been applied are used to determine proteomes and post-translational modification dynamics. Although such datasets favour the characterisation of thousands of modified peptides, e.g., phosphorylated and N-Î±-acetylated, a large fraction of the acquired spectra remain unexplained by standard proteomics approaches. Thus, advanced data processing allows characterisation of a significant part of these unassigned spectra.


METHODS
Our recent investigation of the N-Î±-acetylation status of plant proteins gave a dataset of choice to investigate further the in-depth characterisation of peptide modifications using Mascot tools associated with relevant validation processes. Such an approach allows to target frequently occurring modifications such as methionine oxidation, phosphorylation or N-Î±-acetylation, but also the less usual peptide cationisation. Finally, this dataset offers the unique opportunity to determine the overall influence of some of these modifications on the identification score.


RESULTS
Although methionine oxidation has no influence and tends to favour the characterisation of protein N-terminal peptides, peptide alkalinisation shows an adverse effect on peptide average score. Nevertheless, peptide cationisation appears to favour the characterisation of protein C-terminal peptides with a limited to no direct influence on the identification score. Unexpectedly, our investigation reveals the unfortunate combination of the molecular weight of N-Î±-acetylation and potassium cation that mimics the mass increment of a phosphorylation group.


CONCLUSIONS
Since these characterisations rely upon computational treatment associated with statistical validation approaches such as 'False discovery rates' calculation or post-translational modification position validation, our investigation highlights the limitation of such treatment which is biased by the initial searched hypotheses.",2013,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Willy V.

87f6ca72c658138116b7333e191794e99a224a6e,Abstract 5054: Transcriptional changes in breast cancer initiation,"Background: Identifying the earliest stages of breast cancer carcinogenesis, present well before any clinical signs of disease, is the necessary underpinning of an effective breast cancer prevention strategy. We propose to elucidate transcriptomic changes occurring in the breast tissue during cancer initiation. by analyzing biospecimens donated by women before any clinical sign of sporadic breast tumor (here labeled â€œsusceptibleâ€). In the present work, we report on the transcriptome differences in the microdissected breast compartments (epithelium, stroma and fat) of susceptible versus healthy premenopausal women. Methods: The specimens were obtained from the Susan G. Komen Tissue Bank at IU Simon Cancer Center. We compared the transcriptome profiles of breast tissues from 7 susceptible and 17 healthy premenopausal women between the age of 34 and 52 years, who were free of breast pathology at the time of donation. Donors in the two experimental groups were matched according to age, racial background and menstrual phase. Differential expression analysis was performed using EdegR. False discovery rate (FDR) was computed from p-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to identify relevant signaling pathways. Because circulating hormones variations during menstrual cycle affect the breast epithelium gene expression, we also examined transcriptome differences independently from the menstrual phase. Results/Discussion: We found 536 transcripts differentially expressed between the two groups (p 2 and FDR Conclusion: This study shows that earliest alterations in breast cancer initiation affect metabolic pathway as well as transcriptional regulation. Interestingly, cell adhesion signaling may also be dysregulated at this early stage of cancer development. The findings will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of cancer initiation, as well as the identification of new therapeutic targets and thus, improvement of preventive interventions.

c207db590a6b6479709a6215341168fcbd721f88,Selected Contribution: Identification of differentially expressed genes between young and old rat soleus muscle during recovery from immobilization-induced atrophy.,"After cessation of hindlimb immobilization, which resulted in a 27-37% loss in soleus mass, the atrophied soleus muscle of young but not old rats regrows to its mass before treatment. We hypothesized that during remobilization the mRNA levels of growth potentiating factor(s) would be present in the soleus muscle of young (3- to 4-mo-old) but absent in old (30- to 31-mo-old) Fischer 344 x Brown Norway rats or that mRNAs for growth inhibitory factor(s) would be absent in young but present in old. Gene expression levels of >24,000 transcripts were determined by using Affymetrix RGU34A-C high-density oligonucleotide microarrays in soleus muscles at 3, 6, 10, and 30 days of remobilization after cessation of a 10-day period of hindlimb immobilization. Each muscle sample was applied to an independent set of arrays. Recovery-related differences were determined by using a three-factor ANOVA with a false discovery rate-adjustment of P = 0.01, which yielded 64 significantly different probe sets. Elfin, amphiregulin, and clusterin mRNAs were selected for further confirmation by real-time PCR. Elfin mRNA levels were less in old than in young rats at 6, 10, and 30 days of remobilization. Amphiregulin expression exhibited a unique spike on the 10th day of successful regrowth in young rats but remained unchanged old. Clusterin mRNA was unchanged in young muscles but was elevated on the 3rd, 6th, and 10th days of recovery in old soleus muscles. The mRNAs identified as differentially expressed between young and old recovery may modulate muscle growth that could highlight new candidate mechanisms to explain the failure of old soleus muscle to recover lost muscle mass.",2003,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""J Scott Pattison"", ids = ""47302637""); list(name = ""Lillian C.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are more frequent in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients when compared to controls. In particular, CVDs are linked with higher accumulation of lesions and advanced brain atrophy.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate whether CVDs contribute to accelerated lesion accumulation and brain atrophy over 5 years in patients with MS.


METHODS
194 MS patients and 43 controls without neurologic disease were followed for 5 years. Full physical, neurological evaluation, and structured questionnaire investigating CVD and risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, smoking, diabetes, obesity/overweight) were collected using interview-based questionnaire and further cross-reference with electronic medical records. Lesion and brain atrophy outcomes were assessed with 3T MRI. ANCOVA adjusted for age, gender, and disease duration were used accordingly. False discovery rate correction was performed using Benjamini-Hochberg correction.


RESULTS
Patients with diagnosis of heart disease showed higher white matter and whole brain volume loss compared to those without (-4.2% vs. -0.7%, P = 0.01 and -3.4% vs. -1.6%, P = 0.01, respectively). The percentage lateral ventricle volume change in MS patients with hypertension was higher compared to non-hypertensive patients (24.5% vs. 14.1%, P = 0.05). Hyperlipidemia, smoking, and obesity/overweight were not associated with progression of MRI-derived outcomes. CVDs did not contribute to larger lesion volume accrual over the 5-year period. The presence of CVDs was not associated with MRI-derived changes in the controls.


CONCLUSIONS
Hypertension and heart disease contribute to advanced brain atrophy in MS patients. CVDs did not contribute to additional lesion accrual. CVD comorbidities in MS patients may contribute to neurodegenerative tissue injury that can be detected with brain MRI.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dejan Jakimovski"", ids = ""5855155""); list(name = ""Sirin Gandhi"", ids = ""47997706""); list(name = ""I Paunkoski"", ids = ""51249901""); list(name = ""Niels P Bergsland"", ids = ""2599672""); list(name = ""Jesper Hagemeier"", ids = ""2640931""); list(name = ""Deepa P Ramasamy"", ids = ""144512855""); list(name = ""D Hojnacki"", ids = ""4022399""); list(name = ""C Kolb"", ids = ""145957768""); list(name = ""Ralph H.

57289de443b427a4237d30631fc6a815853a0064,Discovering Common Sequence Variation in Arabidopsis thaliana,"In order to characterize natural sequence variation in 20 strains of Arabidopsis thaliana, whole-genome resequencing with high-density oligonucleotide arrays was performed in collaboration with Perlegen Sciences Inc. Array data were analyzed with a combination of existing model-based (MB) (1) and novel machine learning (ML) methods. For the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) we developed an algorithm based on support vector machines. Training and evaluation was done on published alignments (2). Confidence levels allow to calibrate false discovery rates (FDR) for the ML SNP predictions. At the same FDR as the MB algorithm, the ML algorithm identifies significantly more true SNPs, especially in regions of high polymorphism density and/or low hybridization quality. The union of SNP predictions from both methods contains on average 143,572 SNPs per strain at a FDR of 2.8% (648,570 non-redundant SNPs). Furthermore, a machine learning algorithm was developed to detect polymorphic regionscontaining insertions, deletions and variational hotspots, where SNP detection algorithms typically fail to identify individual SNPs. It discovers the approximate location of a substantial additional proportion of polymorphisms ( âˆ¼54% of deleted nucleotides andâˆ¼33% of insertion, additionalâˆ¼42% of SNPs). We examined the patterns of and forces shaping sequence variation in Arabidopsis(3): e.g. significant differences were observed between gene families, and genes mediating interaction with the biotic environment harbor exceptional polymorphism levels.",2008,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Gunnar RÃ¤tsch"", ids = ""2414086""); list(name = ""Schweikert G Clark R"", ids = ""116643777""); list(name = ""Ecker J Nordborg M"", ids = ""113389348""); list(name = ""Anja Bohlen"", ids = ""113110117"")",,32bd4ae5e6d9d8edd447caddfaacef99ffeb15b3,,,
c84daff38863b9869632f8e5f6cd636c4db9f09d,Identification of new prognostic markers in renal cell carcinoma,"The clinical course of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) shows a high variability. Prognostic markers are essential to enable an individualized therapeutic strategy. The objective of this study was the identification of novel independent prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets in RCC. The focus was on genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell biology. 
EMT enhances tumor cell motility and hence plays a critical role in invasion and metastasis in various carcinomas. A set of transcription factors acts as master regulators of EMT. Whether EMT is important for tumor progression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is unknown. Therefore, EMT-related genes were selected from the literature, and their role and prognostic relevance in RCC were analyzed. The known cancer stem cell marker CXCR4 and the associated TPBG gene were also analyzed in this project. Additionally, a novel filter strategy was used to analyze RCC oligonucleotide microarray data for identification of potential prognostic markers: genes with increasing expression during tumor progression (normal kidney < primary tumor < metastases) were selected for outcome analysis because they could be crucial for RCC biology. 
Expression of 46 EMT-related genes was analyzed using oligonucleotide microarrays and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in tissue samples from normal kidney and G1 and G3 primary RCC, 14 samples each. Expression of selected EMT genes was validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in normal kidney, primary RCC and metastases in an independent cohort of 112 patients and then combined with follow-up data for survival analysis. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot and flow cytometry were performed to further examine the expression of CXCR4 and co-expression of CXCR4 and TPBG on the surface of RCC cells. GSEA and dChip software were used for microarray data analysis. 
The EMT gene set was preferentially expressed in primary tumors compared to normal tissue (false discovery rate FDR=0.01), but no difference between G1 and G3 tumors was found. Quantitative RT-PCR showed down-regulation of critical EMT genes like CDH2 and ZEB1 in metastases which suggests reversal of EMT during metastasis. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significant better outcome for patients with low CXCR4, vimentin, fibronectin and TWIST1 mRNA levels. Multivariate analysis revealed that CXCR4 and vimentin up-regulation represent independent prognostic markers for poor cancer-specific survival of RCC patients. The microarray approach using filtering and further RT-PCR validation of progression-associated genes revealed that ATAD2, TET3, HELLS and TOP2A are independent and previously unknown predictors of poor outcome in RCC patients. 
Taken together, this study provides strong evidence that EMT occurs in RCC. Modulation of EMT in RCC, therefore, might represent a future therapeutic option. Expression levels of a number of EMT-related genes (like the genes encoding the cancer stem cell marker CXCR4 and vimentin) could be identified as independent prognostic markers. Using a novel filtering approach on array data, additional novel prognostic markers could be identified. These findings contribute to a better risk stratification of RCC patients that can support an individualized and optimized therapeutic strategy.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Dong Chen"", ids = ""49025727"")",,,,,
9ceef3383fdc1b5a9ff92ecb63ad56578fbd780b,Association of MicroRNA Expression Profiles with Karyotype in Acute Myeloid Leukaemias Revealed by Real-Time PCR and In Situ Hybridisation.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single stranded non-coding RNAs of âˆ¼ 22 nucleotides involved in gene regulation. Several examples of an association between disrupted expression of miRNAs and cancer have been shown. Using a real-time quantitative PCR, designed to amplify only from the mature miRNA (TaqManÂ® -MicroRNA Looped-PCR assay, Applied Biosystems), we measured the expression levels of 157 miRNAs in 100 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients representing the spectrum of known karyotypes common in AML, 2 leukaemic cell lines (KG1 and NB4), and the bone marrow from 2 healthy donors. ANOVA analysis using a 5% false discovery rate threshold was performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs between leukaemia samples and normal bone marrow. MiRNAs specific to karyotype groupings were also identified in the same way. A method was developed to demonstrate the spatial localisation, in situ , of specific miRNA identified in the quantification and confirm the expression of miRNA with relation to karyotype. Commercial locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotides (Exiqon) were obtained for two miRNAs ( miRNA-127 and miRNA-154 ), as well as for positive and negative control probes. LNAs were labelled with digoxigenin and probes applied to both cytospins and/or trephines of a sample set representative of the different AML subtypes. Detection of hybridisation signals was either by colorimetric or fluorescent reaction and visualised by confocal microscopy. Unsupervised cluster analysis revealed an association of miRNA expression with the karyotype of the samples. Promyelocytic leukaemias (APML) bearing the t(15;17) translocation, show a distinct pattern characterised by the high expression of a subset of 10 miRNAs located in the human 14q32 imprinted domain, including miR-127 and miR-154 . ANOVA data analysis revealed the de-regulation of 33 miRNAs across the leukaemic set in respect to bone marrow from healthy donors. Seventeen miRNAs were up-regulated and 16 down-regulated. MiRNAs miR-155 , miR-181a , miR-181b , miR-181c , miR-142-5p , miR-221 , and miR-222 , were among those commonly highly expressed. Down-regulated were miR-26a , miR-34c , and miR-199a . MiRNAs miR-10a and miR-125b showed the highest variability throughout the samples, being associated with specific subgroups. In situ hybridisation analysis of miR-127 and miR-154 confirmed the results obtained by real-time PCR of their expression associated with APML. This study, conducted on about a third of the miRNAs reported in the Sanger database (microrna.sanger.ac.uk), demonstrates the potential for using miRNA expression to sub-classify cancer.

5da4294a9e08ba800c7005de992c31f9fab296b5,Joint modeling of ChIP-seq data via a Markov random field model.,"Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments have now become routine in biology for the detection of protein-binding sites. In this paper, we present a Markov random field model for the joint analysis of multiple ChIP-seq experiments. The proposed model naturally accounts for spatial dependencies in the data, by assuming first-order Markov dependence and, for the large proportion of zero counts, by using zero-inflated mixture distributions. In contrast to all other available implementations, the model allows for the joint modeling of multiple experiments, by incorporating key aspects of the experimental design. In particular, the model uses the information about replicates and about the different antibodies used in the experiments. An extensive simulation study shows a lower false non-discovery rate for the proposed method, compared with existing methods, at the same false discovery rate. Finally, we present an analysis on real data for the detection of histone modifications of two chromatin modifiers from eight ChIP-seq experiments, including technical replicates with different IP efficiencies.",2014,Mathematics; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yanchun Bao"", ids = ""1408875472""); list(name = ""Veronica Vinciotti"", ids = ""3173242""); list(name = ""Ernst Wit"", ids = ""145328439""); list(name = ""Peter A.

Previous research and selection strategies have focused on the impact of bulls with PH in gain-test; however, little information is available on heifers that are typically developed in grazing systems. We hypothesized that indicator traits for PH in heifers are genomically associated with growth traits. The objectives of this study were to 1) identify SNP associated with yearling mean pulmonary arterial pressure (YPAP) and growth traits, 2) evaluate sequence variants common to YPAP and growth traits, and 3) identify underlying genes for QTL in Angus cattle. Yearling heifers (nâ€¯=â€¯1180) grazing in a high-altitude beef production system were measured for YPAP. Additionally, growth measures such as age of dam adjusted birth weight (BW), 205 d weaning weight (WW), 365 d yearling weight (YW), 365 d hip height (HH), and 160 d post-weaning gain (PWG) were also recorded. Isolated DNA from blood, hair, or blood card samples were analyzed using the Ilumina BovineSNP50 Beadchip. Genome-wide association analyses were conducted using an additive multi-locus mixed model with a 5% false discovery rate to account for multiple comparisons. Genotypes adjusted for FDR (Pâ€¯â‰¤â€¯1.00Eâˆ’05; number of SNP) were associated with BW (2), YW (1), PWG (1), and HH (6), but no SNP were associated with YPAP or WW at this significance level. Associated SNP (Pâ€¯â‰¤â€¯1.00Eâˆ’03; number of SNP) were identified for YPAP (37), BW (42), WW (31), YW (38), PWG (36), and HH (65). There was one SNP concordant with YPAP, YW, and HH, another with YPAP, YW, and PWG, and one SNP was concordant between YPAP and BW. Underlying genes within 1â€¯kb of concordant SNP were SLC36A2 and CFAP58 and are involved in small amino acid transportation and cell cycle processes, respectively. Results suggested that 2 genomic regions may co-associate YPAP and growth traits. However, given these SNP accounted for",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Rebecca R.

38cb94993f4feea7f40588648913ad29096589fc,Greater Spending Associated with Improved Survival for Some Cancers in OCM-Defined Episodes.,"BACKGROUND
Previous research finds significant variation in spending and utilization across regions, with little evidence of differences in outcomes. While such findings have been interpreted as evidence that spending can be reduced without compromising patient outcomes, the link between spending variation and outcomes remains a critical question.


OBJECTIVE
To use evidence from geographic variations in spending and an individual-level survival analysis to test whether spending within oncology care episodes is associated with survival, where episodes are defined as in the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation's Oncology Care Model (OCM).


METHODS
In this retrospective cohort analysis, patient data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Medicare (SEER-Medicare) database for 2007-2013 were linked to hospital referral regions (HRRs) using ZIP codes. Patients in the SEER program are a part of selected population-based cancer registries throughout the United States whose records are linked to Medicare enrollment and claims data (93% of elderly registry patients were successfully linked to Medicare data). Episodes of cancer care were defined as in the OCM: 6 months following a triggering chemotherapy claim. We analyzed episodes of care for 5 tumor types: advanced breast cancer (BC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), multiple myeloma (MM), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We removed the effects of differentials in Medicare payment rates, which were mostly geographic. Regression analysis was then used to calculate standardized spending levels for each HRR, that is, spending adjusted for differences in patient and episode characteristics. To examine the effect of spending during OCM-defined episodes on individual-level survival, we used Cox regression with patient characteristics and standardized HRR spending per episode as covariates. To address concerns that may arise from multiple comparisons across the 5 tumor types, we used the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate.


RESULTS
Our analysis showed significant differences in standardized spending across HRRs. Compared with spending at the 20th percentile episode, spending at the 80th percentile ranged from 25% higher ($57,392 vs. $45,995 for MM) to 47% higher ($36,920 vs. $24,127 for RCC), indicating practice style variation across regions. The hazard of dying for patients with NSCLC and MM statistically significantly decreased by 7% (HR = 0.93, P = 0.006) and 13% (HR = 0.87, P = 0.019), respectively, for a $10,000 increase in standardized spending (in 2013 U.S. dollars). For the 3 other cancers, spending effects were not statistically significant. After using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with a 5% false discovery rate, the effects of increased spending on improved survival for NSCLC and MM remained statistically significant.


CONCLUSIONS
The association we found between spending and survival suggests caution may be warranted for physicians, pharmacists, other health care professionals, and policymakers involved in efforts to reduce across-the-board spending within OCM-defined episodes for at least 2 of the 5 cancers studied.

88a2f5129a01f5a7b1a2bb4e802d046822f65a39,Extended Bayesian information criteria for model selection with large model spaces,"The ordinary Bayesian information criterion is too liberal for model selection when the model space is large. In this paper, we re-examine the Bayesian paradigm for model selection and propose an extended family of Bayesian information criteria, which take into account both the number of unknown parameters and the complexity of the model space. Their consistency is established, in particular allowing the number of covariates to increase to infinity with the sample size. Their performance in various situations is evaluated by simulation studies. It is demonstrated that the extended Bayesian information criteria incur a small loss in the positive selection rate but tightly control the false discovery rate, a desirable property in many applications. The extended Bayesian information criteria are extremely useful for variable selection in problems with a moderate sample size but with a huge number of covariates, especially in genome-wide association studies, which are now an active area in genetics research.

52ce358bc0dd3bc6c3c0e09baf2612f98724d565,A Multidimensional Chromatography Technology for Global Phosphoproteome Analysis of Human Liver,"Protein phosphorylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications, which regulates essential functions such as cell division, signal transduction, and so forth. However, the analysis of protein phosphorylation faces great challenges due to its highly dynamic nature and low stoichiometry. It is necessary to reduce the complexity of the samples to identification of phosphorylation sites and quantitation of phosphopeptides. We developed and evaluated a two-dimensional separation system for phosphopeptide analysis by employing reversed-phase columns in both separation dimensions. The greatest orthogonality of 2D separation was achieved for pH 7.5 in the first and pH 2.6 in the second LC dimension. Combination of this multidimensional system with immobilized metal affinity chromatography, high-accuracy mass spectrometry instrumentation analysis, and target-decoy database search strategy, the identification of 7,419 nonredundant phosphorylation sites from 2,455 proteins from 40mg human liver at false discovery rate of 1.0% was achieved.

However, transcriptome programming in neonatal cardiac chambers during perinatal stages is understudied. In particular, the changes in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in neonatal heart have not been explored. Objective: To achieve transcriptome-wide analysis of lncRNAs in neonatal left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) during maturation stages using deep RNA-Sequencing Methods: Deep RNA-sequencing was performed on male newborn mouse (C57 BL) LV and RV at 3 time points of perinatal circulatory transition: P0, P3 and P7. Reads were mapped to mouse genome (mm10). The lncRNAs annotated in NONCODE database were identified. Differentially expressed lncRNAs were defined as those with coefficient of variation â‰¥0.2, at a false discovery rate â‰¤0.05, and expressed at â‰¥3 RPKM in at least one sample.

We hypothesize that more gene sets can be created by next-generation text mining (next-gen TM), and that these can be used with gene set analysis (GSA) methods for chemical treatment identification, for pharmacological mechanism elucidation, and for comparing compound toxicity profiles.MethodsWe created 30,211 chemical response-specific gene sets for human and mouse by next-gen TM, and derived 1,189 (human) and 588 (mouse) gene sets from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). We tested for significant differential expression (SDE) (false discovery rate -corrected p-values < 0.05) of the next-gen TM-derived gene sets and the CTD-derived gene sets in gene expression (GE) data sets of five chemicals (from experimental models). We tested for SDE of gene sets for six fibrates in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) knock-out GE dataset and compared to results from the Connectivity Map. We tested for SDE of 319 next-gen TM-derived gene sets for environmental toxicants in three GE data sets of triazoles, and tested for SDE of 442 gene sets associated with embryonic structures. We compared the gene sets to triazole effects seen in the Whole Embryo Culture (WEC), and used principal component analysis (PCA) to discriminate triazoles from other chemicals.ResultsNext-gen TM-derived gene sets matching the chemical treatment were significantly altered in three GE data sets, and the corresponding CTD-derived gene sets were significantly altered in five GE data sets. Six next-gen TM-derived and four CTD-derived fibrate gene sets were significantly altered in the PPARA knock-out GE dataset. None of the fibrate signatures in cMap scored significant against the PPARA GE signature. 33 environmental toxicant gene sets were significantly altered in the triazole GE data sets. 21 of these toxicants had a similar toxicity pattern as the triazoles. We confirmed embryotoxic effects, and discriminated triazoles from other chemicals.ConclusionsGene set analysis with next-gen TM-derived chemical response-specific gene sets is a scalable method for identifying similarities in gene responses to other chemicals, from which one may infer potential mode of action and/or toxic effect.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kristina M.

4ecbfd996239e7dfc9d4a04e98449165e432ec9f,Molecular description of ANGPT2 associated colorectal carcinoma.,"Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) is a prognostic factor in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Nevertheless, it remains to be elucidated which molecular characteristics make up the ANGPT2-related poor-prognosis CRC subset. Public transcriptomic datasets were collected from Gene Expression Omnibus GEO and with the TCGAbiolinks R-package for the TCGA. After appropriate normalization, differential expression analysis was performed using Benjamini and Hochberg method for false discovery rate. Plasma from two prospective clinical trials were used to investigate the clinical impact of ANGPT2-related biomarkers. In the 935 samples included in 4 annotated platforms (GPL) and derived from localized CRC, ANGPT2hi expression conferred a worst overall survival (HRÂ =Â 1.20; pÂ =Â 0.02). CRC stage, ANGPT2hi expression but not CMS (Consortium Molecular Subtype) predict overall survival in multivariate analysis. ANGPT2 expression was not correlated to a specific CMS nor to RAS, RAF, MSI, p53, CIN, CIMP genomic alterations. Gene expression analysis revealed that ANGPT2hi CRC subset is characterized by angiogenesis-related gene expression, presence of myeloid cells, stromal organization and resistance to chemotherapy. A prognostic model was proposed using seric levels of ANGPT2, STC1 and CD138 in 97 mCRC patients. Our results provide evidence that ANGPT2 is a prognostic factor in localized CRC and defined a specific CRC subset with potential clinical implementation. This article is protected by copyright.

Conventional statistical analyses of HTS studies often suffer from high testing error rates and soaring costs in large-scale settings. This article develops new methodologies for false discovery rate control and optimal design in HTS studies. We propose a two-stage procedure that determines the optimal numbers of replicates at different screening stages while simultaneously controlling the false discovery rate in the confirmatory stage subject to a constraint on the total budget. The merits of the proposed methods are illustrated using both simulated and real data.

02a66c3103eff99bc3534dc17100400b728628ad,SERPINA1 gene polymorphisms in a population-based ALSPAC cohort.,"BACKGROUND
There is an association between persistent preschool wheezing phenotypes and school-age asthma. These wheezing/asthma phenotypes likely represent clinical entities having specific genetic risk factors. The SERPINA1 gene encodes Î± 1 -antitrypsin (AAT), and mutations in the gene are important in the pathophysiology of pulmonary diseases. We hypothesized that there might be an association between SERPINA1 gene polymorphisms and the risk of developing wheezing/school age asthma.


OBJECTIVE
To examine 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SERPINA1 (rs6647, rs11832, rs17580, rs709932, rs1243160, rs2854254, rs8004738, rs17751769, rs28929470, and rs28929474) and relate them to childhood wheezing phenotypes and doctor-diagnosed asthma in the population-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort.


METHODS
Wheeze data, reports of physician-diagnosed asthma and data on the SERPINA1 gene SNPs, were available for 7964 children. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the associations between allele prevalence and wheezing and asthma phenotypes. P values were adjusted to account for multiple hypotheses using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate.


RESULTS
Only within a subgroup of children with asthma who had no prior diagnosis of preschool wheeze was there a trend for association between rs28929474 (Glu342Lys, Pi*Z causing AAT deficiency; Pâ€‰=â€‰.0058, adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰.058). No SNP was associated with wheezing and asthma in those with preschool wheeze.


CONCLUSION
Analyzed SNPs in SERPINA1 are not associated with wheezing/asthma phenotypes. Only rs28929474, the most common pathologic SNP (Pi*Z) in the SERPINA1 gene, might be associated with a risk of developing school-age asthma without exhibiting preschool wheeze.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""David S.

Thus, we hypothesized that in utero exposure to residential PAHs may be associated with genome-wide DMRs in genes that may influence ALL development. Methods PAHs were measured in dust samples collected using a high-volume surface sampler or household vacuum cleaners from homes of California Childhood Leukemia Study participants who have lived in the same home since diagnosis. The different PAHs were summed according to their toxic equivalency. DNA was extracted from archived neonatal blood spots of participants, then treated with bisulfite and assayed on Illumina Infinium 450K genome-wide DNA methylation arrays. Following removal of cross-reacting probes, SNP-related and polymorphic CpGs, we analyzed the association of residential PAH levels with methylation intensity of 319,265 CpGs in two independent case-only datasets (model #1: set 1 cases n = 84, set 2 cases n = 51). We used a false discovery rate with random resampling to reduce the number of false-positive findings and cross-validated the results between sets. This first step of the analysis gave 11 significant and sign concordant CpGs. Then we assessed interactions between case/control status and PAHs levels with methylation intensities at those 11 CpGs in set 1 (model #2: total cases and controls n = 306). Models were adjusted for cell mixture, sex, gestational age, race and the first 2 principal components of the modelsâ€™ residuals. Results In model #1, methylation levels at 11 CpGs were significantly associated with residential PAH levels and sign concordant in both sets with a corresponding q-value Conclusions For the first time, our genome-wide methylation investigation found that residential PAH levels were associated with 11 CpGs at birth among children who later developed ALL. Moreover, the future cases had significantly different DNA methylation responses to PAH exposures than the unaffected controls for 7 CpGs. This may suggest a case/control difference present at birth in the sensitivity to PAHs in particular cell-cycle and tumor-suppressor genes. These CpGs may be good candidates to further investigate with respect to leukemogenesis. Citation Format: Semira Gonseth, Todd P. Whitehead, Ritu Roy, E.

Resistance to platinum based chemotherapy is a major factor in the poor prognosis associated with advanced stage ovarian cancer. We hypothesised that by taking advantage of the reduced variance associated with the use of isogenic resources, gene expression profiling could be used to identify molecular alterations characteristic of the platinum resistant phenotype. Using cDNA microarrays we have measured gene expression levels for four clinically derived, isogenically matched cell line pairs representing platinum sensitivity and resistance, for which we have demonstrated stable reflection of clinical resistance in vitro by calculation of IC50s for cisplatin (average between pair difference in IC50= 5.8 fold). Microarray hybridisations were performed in quadruplicate employing a dye swap design. Analysis of loess normalised data identified 65 genes commonly upregulated in resistant cells and 92 genes commonly downregulated in resistant cells by applying the following criteria: =>1.5 fold change in 3 out of 4 pairs; t-test p<0.05; applying the Benjamini & Hochberg false discovery rate multiple testing correction. Focussing on genes overexpressed in resistant cells, and thus potential therapeutic targets, we considered the functional annotation and degree of fold change of each to produce a sub set of 11 upregulated genes which were further analysed. Quantitative real time PCR and western blot were used to confirm expression differences from the microarray studies prior to using siRNA to specifically reduce the expression levels of each target gene. Resensitisation to cisplatin following siRNA knockdown was assessed for each target using a luminescence based caspase 3/7 assay. SiRNA based knockdown of five of these genes (STAT1, PIK3R1, PTK2, FOLR2 and HDAC4) resulted in partial restoration of platinum sensitivity in the clinically resistant cell line PEO4. We are currently investigating the synergistic or additive effects of simultaneous knockdown of two or more of these genes and furthermore are evaluating their clinical relevance by correlating protein levels, detected by immuno-histochemistrty using a tissue microarray of ovarian tumours, with clinical response and outcome endpoints. A statistical analysis of this data will be presented.",2008,Biology,"list(name = ""Euan A.

12ad014656a236832e6b8c0d6a709b06294d10fa,Predicting pain relief: Use of pre-surgical trigeminal nerve diffusion metrics in trigeminal neuralgia,"Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic neuropathic facial pain disorder that commonly responds to surgery. A proportion of patients, however, do not benefit and suffer ongoing pain. There are currently no imaging tools that permit the prediction of treatment response. To address this paucity, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to determine whether pre-surgical trigeminal nerve microstructural diffusivities can prognosticate response to TN treatment. In 31 TN patients and 16 healthy controls, multi-tensor tractography was used to extract DTI-derived metrics-axial (AD), radial (RD), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA)-from the cisternal segment, root entry zone and pontine segment of trigeminal nerves for false discovery rate-corrected Student's t-tests. Ipsilateral diffusivities were bootstrap resampled to visualize group-level diffusivity thresholds of long-term response. To obtain an individual-level statistical classifier of surgical response, we conducted discriminant function analysis (DFA) with the type of surgery chosen alongside ipsilateral measurements and ipsilateral/contralateral ratios of AD and RD from all regions of interest as prediction variables. Abnormal diffusivity in the trigeminal pontine fibers, demonstrated by increased AD, highlighted non-responders (nÂ =Â 14) compared to controls. Bootstrap resampling revealed three ipsilateral diffusivity thresholds of response-pontine AD, MD, cisternal FA-separating 85% of non-responders from responders. DFA produced an 83.9% (71.0% using leave-one-out-cross-validation) accurate prognosticator of response that successfully identified 12/14 non-responders. Our study demonstrates that pre-surgical DTI metrics can serve as a highly predictive, individualized tool to prognosticate surgical response. We further highlight abnormal pontine segment diffusivities as key features of treatment non-response and confirm the axiom that central pain does not commonly benefit from peripheral treatments.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Peter S.-P.

cccef69a4737e2dd3057b413c775dd2245470da0,Exon level machine learning analyses elucidate novel candidate miRNA targets in an avian model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder,"Gestational alcohol exposure causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and is a prominent cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) offer insights into mechanisms underlying FASD, but gene-level analysis provides limited information regarding complex transcriptional processes such as alternative splicing and non-coding RNAs. Moreover, traditional analytical approaches that use multiple hypothesis testing with a false discovery rate adjustment prioritize genes based on an adjusted p-value, which is not always biologically relevant. We address these limitations with a novel approach and implemented an unsupervised machine learning model, which we applied to an exon-level analysis to reduce data complexity to the most likely functionally relevant exons, without loss of novel information. This was performed on an RNA-Seq paired-end dataset derived from alcohol-exposed neural fold-stage chick crania, wherein alcohol causes facial deficits recapitulating those of FASD. A principal component analysis along with k-means clustering was utilized to extract exons that deviated from baseline expression. This identified 6857 differentially expressed exons representing 1251 geneIDs; 391 of these genes were identified in a prior gene-level analysis of this dataset. It also identified exons encoding 23 microRNAs (miRNAs) having significantly differential expression profiles in response to alcohol. We developed an RDAVID pipeline to identify KEGG pathways represented by these exons, and separately identified predicted KEGG pathways targeted by these miRNAs. Several of these (ribosome biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation) were identified in our prior gene-level analysis. Other pathways are crucial to facial morphogenesis and represent both novel (focal adhesion, FoxO signaling, insulin signaling) and known (Wnt signaling) alcohol targets. Importantly, there was substantial overlap between the exomes themselves and the predicted miRNA targets, suggesting these miRNAs contribute to the gene-level expression changes. Our novel application of unsupervised machine learning in conjunction with statistical analyses facilitated the discovery of signaling pathways and miRNAs that inform mechanisms underlying FASD.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Abrar E.

Preventing chronic cardiovascular diseases caused by air pollution relies on detecting the early effects of pollutants on the risk of cardiovascular disease development, which is limited by the lack of sensitive biomarkers. We have identified promising biomarkers in experimental animals but comparable evidence in humans is lacking. Methods: Air pollution is substantially worse in Beijing than in Los Angeles. We collected urine and blood samples from 26 non-smoking, healthy adult residents of Los Angeles (mean age, 23.8 years, 14 women) before, during, and after they spent 10 weeks in Beijing during the summers of 2014 and 2015. We assessed a panel of circulating biomarkers indicative of lipid peroxidation and inflammation. Personal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a group of combustion-originated air pollutants, was assessed by urinary PAHs metabolites. Results: Urinary concentrations of four PAHs metabolites were 176% (95% CI, 103% to 276%) to 800% (95% CI, 509% to 1780%) greater in Beijing than in Los Angeles. Concentrations of six lipid peroxidation biomarkers were also increased in Beijing, among which 5-, 12-, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic (HETE), and 9-, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic (HODE) acids reached statistical significance (false discovery rate<5%), but not the 8-isoprostane (20.8%; 95%CI, -5.0% to 53.6%). The anti-oxidative activities of paraoxonase (-9.8%; 95%CI, -14.0% to -5.3%) and arylesterase (-14.5%; 95%CI, -22.3% to -5.8%) were lower, and pro-inflammatory Creactive protein (101%; 95% CI, 3.3% to 291%) and fibrinogen (48.3%; 95% CI, 4.9% to 110%) concentrations were higher in Beijing. Changes in all these biomarkers were reversed, at least partially, after study participants returned to Los Angeles. Changes in most outcomes were associated with urinary PAHs metabolites (p<0.05). Conclusions: Traveling from a less-polluted to a more-polluted city induces systemic prooxidative and pro-inflammatory effects. Changes in the levels of HETEs and HODEs as well as paraoxonase and arylesterase activities in the blood, in association with exposures to PAHs, might have important implications in preventive medicine as indicators of increased cardiovascular risk caused by air pollution exposure.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yue Lin"", ids = ""49416353""); list(name = ""Gajalakshmi Ramanathan"", ids = ""40537682""); list(name = ""Yifang Zhu"", ids = ""150354166""); list(name = ""F.

Genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia have demonstrated that variations in noncoding regions are responsible for most of the common variation heritability of the disease. It is hypothesized that these risk variants alter gene expression. Therefore, studying alterations in gene expression in schizophrenia may provide a direct approach to understanding the etiology of the disease. In this study we use cultured neural progenitor cells derived from olfactory neuroepithelium (CNON cells) as a genetically unaltered cellular model to elucidate the neurodevelopmental aspects of schizophrenia.


METHODS
We performed a gene expression study using RNA sequencing of CNON cells from 111 control subjects and 144 individuals with schizophrenia. Differentially expressed genes were identified with DESeq2 software, using covariates to correct for sex, age, library batches, and 1 surrogate variable component.


RESULTS
A total of 80 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate < 10%), showing enrichment in cell migration, cell adhesion, developmental process, synapse assembly, cell proliferation, and related Gene Ontology categories. Cadherin and Wnt signaling pathways were positive in overrepresentation test, and, in addition, many genes were specifically involved in WNT5A signaling. The differentially expressed genes were modestly, but significantly, enriched in the genes overlapping single nucleotide polymorphisms with genome-wide significant association from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium genome-wide association study of schizophrenia. We also found substantial overlap with genes associated with other psychiatric disorders or brain development, enrichment in the same Gene Ontology categories as genes with mutations de novo in schizophrenia, and studies of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells.


CONCLUSIONS
CNON cells are a good model of the neurodevelopmental aspects of schizophrenia and can be used to elucidate the etiology of the disorder.",2020,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Oleg V.

8600a8d8067231b0b854f091b5ffe0eadeeb98e6,Network-based statistic: Identifying differences in brain networks,"Large-scale functional or structural brain connectivity can be modeled as a network, or graph. This paper presents a statistical approach to identify connections in such a graph that may be associated with a diagnostic status in case-control studies, changing psychological contexts in task-based studies, or correlations with various cognitive and behavioral measures. The new approach, called the network-based statistic (NBS), is a method to control the family-wise error rate (in the weak sense) when mass-univariate testing is performed at every connection comprising the graph. To potentially offer a substantial gain in power, the NBS exploits the extent to which the connections comprising the contrast or effect of interest are interconnected. The NBS is based on the principles underpinning traditional cluster-based thresholding of statistical parametric maps. The purpose of this paper is to: (i) introduce the NBS for the first time; (ii) evaluate its power with the use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves; and, (iii) demonstrate its utility with application to a real case-control study involving a group of people with schizophrenia for which resting-state functional MRI data were acquired. The NBS identified a expansive dysconnected subnetwork in the group with schizophrenia, primarily comprising fronto-temporal and occipito-temporal dysconnections, whereas a mass-univariate analysis controlled with the false discovery rate failed to identify a subnetwork.",2010,Medicine; Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Andrew Zalesky"", ids = ""3200076""); list(name = ""Alex Fornito"", ids = ""2362590""); list(name = ""Edward T.

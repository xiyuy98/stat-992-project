8f7ae1dd843a315437626c83bc2291a65913bf64,Discovering focal regions of slightly-aggregated sparse signals,"The characteristic aspects of dynamic distortions on a lengthy time series of i.i.d. pure noise when embedded with slightly-aggregating sparse signals are summarized into a significantly shorter recurrence time process of a chosen extreme event. We first employ the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov statistic to compare the empirical recurrence time distribution with the null geometry distribution when no signal being present in the original time series. The power of such a hypothesis testing depends on varying degrees of aggregation of sparse signals: from a completely random distribution of singletons to batches of various sizes on the entire temporal span. We demonstrate the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov statistic capturing the dynamic distortions due to slightly-aggregating sparse signals better than does Tukeyâ€™s Higher Criticism statistic even when the batch size is as small as five. Secondly, after confirming the presence of signals in the pure noise time series, we apply the hierarchical factor segmentation (HFS) algorithm again based on the recurrence time process to compute focal segments that contain a significantly higher intensity of signals than do the rest of the temporal regions. In a computer experiment with a given fixed number of signals, the focal segments identified by the HFS algorithm afford many folds of signal intensity which also critically depend on the degree of aggregation of sparse signals. This ratio information can facilitate better sensitivity, equivalent to a smaller false discovery rate, if the signal-discovering protocol implemented within the computed focal regions is different from that used outside of the focal regions. We also numerically compute the specificity as the total number of signals contained in the computed collection of focal regions, which indicates the inherent difficulty in the task of sparse signal discovery.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Shu-chun Chen"", ids = ""48847638""); list(name = ""Hsieh Fushing"", ids = ""6383483""); list(name = ""Chii-Ruey Hwang"", ids = ""1955900"")",,,Computational Statistics,28,2295-2308

To solve these problems, researchers have proposed different approaches to multiple testing methods, considering family-wise error rate (FWER), false discovery rate (FDR) or false nondiscovery rate (FNR) as a type I error and some test statistics. In this article, we discuss Bonferroni (1960), Holm (1979), Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) and Benjamini and Yekutieli (2001) procedures based on T statistics, modified T statistics or local-pooled-error (LPE) statistics.

We compared the miRNA signature between acquired melanocytic nevi showing clinical atypia (atypic nevi, AN) and common acquired nevi (common nevi, CN). We obtained miRNA profiles from 41 biopsies (22 AN and 19 CN) and showed that AN could be differentiated from CN on the basis of the expression of 36 miRNAs (false discovery rate <0.05). OncomiRs were present in this group, and we further confirmed the differential expression of miR-125b and let-7c by qRT-PCR.

In recent years, it was found that the FDR (False Discovery Rate)-based corrections are more powerful than the FWER (Family-wise Error Rate)-based corrections. Although different FDR-based corrections have been proposed, a systematic and comprehensive comparison of different FDR-based corrections is noticeably absent. In this study, a comparative study of nine FDR-based corrections for handling multiple testing in local statistical of spatial association is performed. Experimental results show that there are significant differences among different corrections. Specifically, corrections under the assumption of independence are remarkably powerful than those under dependence. Of all the corrections the assumption of independence, the GBS is more powerful than others, however, no significant difference is found among them. It is also found that all the FDR-based corrections are still conservative.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Zhanjun He"", ids = ""20536771""); list(name = ""Qiliang Liu"", ids = ""47362448""); list(name = ""Min Deng"", ids = ""145939343""); list(name = ""Feng Xu"", ids = ""48101444"")",27a881cd944462909b7a1b9bec26bc48b7a53e49; dea527df31cd23dee16a203f1fe3c6f32267c903,ee1014390904db3c2c7c1f81719f49450e621a70; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 84dca92e839864988a56c439bb7e4f94adebf7b0; e1afacbd1ecd7f11cb8ca0a283955d8bfa545bd3; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 98cb79d9f6ae0757ffb8517c802813db97ae678e; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f; 4f906bfe6b28535b1d5bac2ac525bfabcf2d9369; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 619d8ff694e856110fce6493ffc57eaecf63aeb0; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 603a5c61a965cce9f9fb9456c5dad5e453db856a; a97e8af759381536766a5c2dfcb611fa0066c93c,2017 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Big Data Analysis (ICBDA)(,,684-687
a45bd631d4acd3c03b84f41261b3736e8a790a98,Graphical approaches for the control of generalised error rates.,"When simultaneously testing multiple hypotheses, the usual approach in the context of confirmatory clinical trials is to control the familywise error rate (FWER), which bounds the probability of making at least one false rejection. In many trial settings, these hypotheses will additionally have a hierarchical structure that reflects the relative importance and links between different clinical objectives. The graphical approach of Bretz et al. (2009) is a flexible and easily communicable way of controlling the FWER while respecting complex trial objectives and multiple structured hypotheses. However, the FWER can be a very stringent criterion that leads to procedures with low power, and may not be appropriate in exploratory trial settings. This motivates controlling generalised error rates, particularly when the number of hypotheses tested is no longer small. We consider the generalised familywise error rate (k-FWER), which is the probability of making k or more false rejections, as well as the tail probability of the false discovery proportion (FDP), which is the probability that the proportion of false rejections is greater than some threshold. We also consider asymptotic control of the false discovery rate (FDR), which is the expectation of the FDP. In this paper, we show how to control these generalised error rates when using the graphical approach and its extensions. We demonstrate the utility of the resulting graphical procedures on three clinical trial case studies.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""David Stuart Robertson"", ids = ""144605344""); list(name = ""James M.

a4fcc3f3bd4008894edd45e70a8cc5acec0703a7,Signs of host genetic regulation in the microbiome composition in cattle,"Previous studies have revealed certain genetic control by the host over the microbiome composition, although in many species the host genetic link controlling microbial composition is yet unknown. This potential association is important in livestock to study all factors and interactions that rule the effect of the microbiome in complex traits. This report aims to study whether the host genotype exerts any genetic control on the microbiome composition of the rumen in cattle. Data on 16S and 18S rRNA gene-based analysis of the rumen microbiome in 18 dairy cows from two different breeds (Holstein and Brown Swiss) were used. The effect of the genetic background of the animal (through the breed and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms; SNP) on the relative abundance (RA) of archaea, bacteria and ciliates (with average relative abundance per breed >0.1%) was analysed using Bayesian statistics. In total, 13 genera were analysed for bacteria (5), archaea (1), and ciliates (7). All these bacteria and archaea genera showed association to the host genetic background both for breed and SNP markers, except RA for the genera Butyrivibrio and Ruminococcus that showed association with the SNP markers but not with the breed composition. Relative abundance of 57% (4/7) of ciliate analysed showed to be associated to the genetic background of the host. This host genetic link was observed in some genus of Trichostomatia family. For instance, the breed had a significant effect on Isotricha, Ophryoscolex and Polyplastron, and the SNP markers on Entodinium, Ophryoscolex and Polyplastron. In total, 77% (10/13) of microbes analysed showed to be associated to the host genetic background (either by breed or SNP genotypes). Further, the results showed a significant association between DGAT1, ACSF3, AGPAT3 and STC2 genes with the relative abundance Prevotella genus with a false discovery rate lower than 15%. The results in this study support the hypothesis and provide some evidence that there exist a host genetic component in cattle that can partially regulate the composition of the microbiome.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Oscar Gonzalez-Recio"", ids = ""1411180120""); list(name = ""Izaro Zubiria"", ids = ""48876063""); list(name = ""AnaÃ­s GarcÃ­a-RodrÃ­guez"", ids = ""1404257520""); list(name = ""Ana Hurtado"", ids = ""144918894""); list(name = ""Raquel Atxaerandio"", ids = ""46309419"")",ee21cfe60e567d146bbc68f5fdf7d60c77bf81cf; c5e522a680bfbdec90064d145ec4e1b48455607f; ab61bfecdd4d9ebe0673514c639b45a88ea43e0f,4dc5a37d61e7dbd4d3d55f8679209e022ea09473; 06413cad7335436bf50dcf9e171ce30444489e4c; 70b48fd1a0c3d9fef98600578308e1e033c0c67a; f8e2fa72e48bf5b74cb728801fd485e2886de9c4; f72519a2ff8b85f29eb2565a8bf82c2e22b2b0a4; be77e871ed48d63cfd71f14690bd7918328245c4; 43294db5d84c3380be21d6262901c0d73e2102e1; 3b7e7b3feaf47430795fb865a746d85df46342f5; 97ad79ce5826c9d0edaf76c13d22f2c5c7fa8a7e; 5ed8d51e98c2f5dd4a21d3d496f01a143fc7f01d; a8945509ae50a412cb3e17ac82c8e51b96b397cd; 9cb6fb773b57c54da2f082ef891bbe70b754d4b8; d5afbc038f630bcf2b8072912e8a29dc72f8d1c2; 0ec05b5198cad4124da29d6f8a714f66d7bb87f0; 60f98f3fdafabba592c6e3e84c3cf141a79dd3f7; 15cb98e22451a7256a8529212f76987400e24733; 9d0021ca89e19d19b25655b7fa1db6e577688014; 4935ddb612fd4564fb71000c7768f363efcdf86f; 284afcd822047733d511a8bf8af4fb0dd7053089; 984b2de4c9edfa5620c5a3cb68fdea5d8cf2cc08; f8ca5f7f5f2b4f8733ce8f3a0f645d657c5ec54a; 70f2e9e6ef7debe01488b43a3e6c6f770318b8ef; 841f74d39aa548b663971924738fc6ff9eb3dcda; 53350ac896c0de98129becc4c9f01dd4875c804a; 180966dbaded1f1dfa78b2192fffe71fc95e83b8; aef3cd584999d1e1ebdaeb7189924d6c32fa4cd9; ef1e6065cf8b33f22c2f2a356dee3f9321b43943; a6c63d6375a6f0677d752dff6052d07c083a6bdd; a8cca80f5ff711c6ad70b65e8436169507cee78e; ffa07713ab975d2758463637df1f70d16ecea4c9; 2699c6f673f14512dfb205f2e55dfdf112699151; 05f0b1a26f3bb86326b7e4172d7a6cfd2bcfff3f,bioRxiv,,
51481146c594d6ad0a7f491d5a838746cc1ca4e3,Digital gene expression analysis of transcriptomes in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.,"BACKGROUND
The mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is high, and its exact pathogenesis remains unclear, which forms a major obstacle for prevention and treatment of this disease. In the present study, we used digital gene expression (DGE) to detect the differentially expressed genes of the lung at 4h after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure in a mouse model.


METHODS
Mice were treated with LPS or control saline by intratracheal instillation for 4h, and their lung tissues were collected for DGE analysis. We used a false discovery rate â‰¤0.001 and an absolute value of the log2 ratioâ‰¥1 as the thresholds for judging the significance of any difference in gene expression between the two members of each pair of mice.


RESULTS
We obtained 3,387,842 clean tags (i.e., after filtering to remove potentially erroneous tags) and about 84,513 corresponding distinct clean tags (i.e., types of tag). Approximately 91.20% of the clean tags could be mapped, and 82.71% could be uniquely mapped, to the reference tags, and 3.82% were unknown tags. At least 2200 differentially expressed genes were identified and analyzed for enrichment of Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway. Twenty genes with the greatest difference in expression levels between the two members of every pair of mice were chosen. The majority of these genes are involved in signaling transduction, molecular adhesion, and metabolic pathways.

We performed an epigenome-wide longitudinal DNAm study of a well-characterized sample of young women from the Swedish Born into Life study, with repeated blood sampling before, during and after pregnancy (nâ€‰=â€‰21), using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array. We conducted a replication in the Isle of Wight third-generation birth cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰27), using the Infinium HumanMethylation450k BeadChip. We identified 196 CpG sites displaying intra-individual longitudinal change in DNAm with a false discovery rate (FDR) Pâ€‰<â€‰.05. Most of these (91%) showed a decrease in average methylation levels over the studied period. We observed several genes represented by â©¾3 differentially methylated CpGs: HOXB3, AVP, LOC100996291, and MicroRNA 10a. Of 36 CpGs available in the replication cohort, 17 were replicated, all but 2 with the same direction of association (replication Pâ€‰<â€‰.05). Biological pathway analysis demonstrated that FDR-significant CpGs belong to genes overrepresented in metabolism-related pathways, such as adipose tissue development, regulation of insulin receptor signaling, and mammary gland fat development. These results contribute to a better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying important physiological alterations and adaptations for pregnancy and lactation.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Olena Gruzieva"", ids = ""6564665""); list(name = ""Simon Kebede Merid"", ids = ""2117432""); list(name = ""Su Chen"", ids = ""145074833""); list(name = ""Nandini Mukherjee"", ids = ""145199334""); list(name = ""Anna M Hedman"", ids = ""114427730""); list(name = ""Catarina Almqvist"", ids = ""4508278""); list(name = ""Ellika G Andolf"", ids = ""5898074""); list(name = ""Yu Jiang"", ids = ""40409290""); list(name = ""Juha Kere"", ids = ""145991916""); list(name = ""Annika Scheynius"", ids = ""7010150""); list(name = ""Cilla SÃ¶derhÃ¤ll"", ids = ""8480091""); list(name = ""V Ullemar"", ids = ""8512867""); list(name = ""Wilfried J J Karmaus"", ids = ""1822075""); list(name = ""Erik MelÃ©n"", ids = ""46483881""); list(name = ""Syed Hasan Arshad"", ids = ""2419927""); list(name = ""GÃ¶ran Pershagen"", ids = ""3594026"")",,eecae05a5a39eadeab991059aa9bcd04e5c2ec08; c051f2ec35716226d3176b8689b329f671407049; b5c944e5d11a89b811d1b282c33ff558d1261e73; cb813dfc48247d0b65f1cb1084a5b4bccf6f3de8; 33150d7d001f163a4c69c472a621fc5baa977789; 2989ef044b6c46e9824b14d0467aedb7eb5e2934; 4f984df0ae4411e0b395d52b1734b06e92864e82; 71964d5c7e7d89b5edce4b6874fa9a80a843bc9b; 217bc8c1add81a28d606e7d3328f69239d47b155; 5da04cbc5d6752e83c72cd3c521072a5b1bd1b9c; 767dc21a322d744118985d37eb718579308f6af3; 4e8aa3c89ea97e06b04e69548b248254e4c7fc1b; 4f6826be6cf58e4f3ae727d961ae8f9b6f48f510; 0f087aee017386ed9e8ece16fcae6ffec5d0ffae; 68af4173e5ed53954db5e053bf39c25a50752f2a; fec5682fc6dab1e470d582e8622b9a3b342ded5e; 17b14f75c3e0b65ed79e4d890a4394fec0368ea7; 392a34dc7cc38f4348d83191130c85dbca8fe2ab; f7c69abce4fa1710858a57fb988bd34d20f61075; e0f9da403806076908df7e31e6a42a0ee031f106; 3340d076a44177a630f1d23a4b9843b3971b4e1e; 917349f4d254e16d294840e2bafcd238f8330506; 9369882b97906ce9295ceb9932995c05d28f7090; e58dc112a095f29acac13bbffba1511aeaa4ad5e; b7ad028fbe0b464636066e95bcef3c1478de5398; 0a3c0bdbcd198b40ebcad0f5928c25f1d863ccc3; 81beb8acad80ee6f475c7fec3616ced27c943750; ffc45be7c138c18893106e053238a609f2c1c5da; ee5d339fffddcd616ca8c13a28f2eb415d33bd09; 6a3be94bf2cfe45bc81729b262d5001e5edc6cf3; 520e35ebd6e192e877cf467482c9682f7ac7362c; 87a775279bdd43847ca692d4258e306052250088; 7e7e790b2f9b2772cb7ce5ddab8dab8c635a1b8b; c99f479766a5d5cd7e7c2befde057039e6d8669f; 682d1c2ff4b022c82a733b3875c313316d1390d2; ae4c26e99bd41d9d29c390b993b4dfac9bc2eb11; 9a39e80d9bae8fb7b6b087c32e8357e2b9f101b7; 25e270f3838df9dcc3f01178e0ccc1ce80a8df67; 427eaafcd47b3abc620b953ff021f25925ff0e62; 9ea6542eba9f632308e26a50e2dcf47fa77dd432; 031ab46ae596950027895acac6dd198e6e12f931; 7f740304a2f05f9dc1a63fcb2a788a107e7dd7cb; ddcf02726fc22fe5e2882dc2cb788926dcecea4e; a11b64fe6d4323f260daf9f20af438e8428f7289; d6780662d62ce843992ea64f68c71fc50c1a2c37; fd868b7a7cf61e360464718eb3f766198bfc2a9d; 7e44e19a3688686d176fb58a8f825546b087a8e7,Epigenetics Insights,12,
abb79b031800acb821b037c98f37ac86d78538d3,Evaluations of FWER-controlling methods in multiple hypothesis testing,"Simultaneously testing a family of n null hypotheses can arise in many applications. A common problem in multiple hypothesis testing is to control Type-I error. The probability of at least one false rejection referred to as the familywise error rate (FWER) is one of the earliest error rate measures. Many FWER-controlling procedures have been proposed. The ability to control the FWER and achieve higher power is often used to evaluate the performance of a controlling procedure. However, when testing multiple hypotheses, FWER and power are not sufficient for evaluating controlling procedureâ€™s performance. Furthermore, the performance of a controlling procedure is also governed by experimental parameters such as the number of hypotheses, sample size, the number of true null hypotheses and data structure. This paper evaluates, under various experimental settings, the performance of some FWER-controlling procedures in terms of five indices, the FWER, the false discovery rate, the false non-discovery rate, the sensitivity and the specificity. The results can provide guidance on how to select an appropriate FWER-controlling procedure to meet a studyâ€™s objective.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yi-Ting Hwang"", ids = ""2223332""); list(name = ""Jia-Jung Lai"", ids = ""120611955""); list(name = ""Shyh-Tyan Ou"", ids = ""3134493"")",1cf4ebb9b594ebd2084d11a804dc9c563a81c62c; 2d98efbb714ded221d4e7a380b1e728ec65fa900; 6b739c6e0680f42a8bb4050638d3319eecf8c4d9; 628f62241eb3b9b99cc424095f55ed15f98c5478,ab72b4eeafc6db949db8424fb39585bb2d5d2c6f; f3ee60244046dd027e3dab3cbbf0e7fce456c2fc; 6946b51f61c89d04885392be786a9606ca7be330; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; c2d083810b932969fc83aed798b0385599e5152a; 15aea778d28812167880acf003dfe7f0eafa1157; 4c66d26cb628bb125200be5102280872e5cc3c29; eb80fe9cffb178271c4e52acc5d3b73d6c9e7dc5; eed9e9bb926c3aa3332026ea00615c75bfdc4e22; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 2356da239d3827bdea639c1b012edb0022d8f203; 6d2ee94678be64c1eba2c87f5da237342de49680; a582005a1a537dcb882e2838ce9c39b5a7206182; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 3c046c8225767e8c903196f10ac4611ba005d2d1; 0b244cfd7b84899bbbdf4ba6c0ed5f5217bda0a1; 3d2fa885a599c52991528309ca309697e39592f6; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; 0514c2895a30b47b7c0449ddc87c5f6b7e4f1556; f4890345d1f0547606508185cf65d49613fbd423,Journal of Applied Statistics,37,1681 - 1694
7d14ce0170c493f05024b82edb3beb83720492e9,Genetic effect in leaf and xylem transcriptome variations among Eucalyptus urophylla x grandis hybrids in field conditions,"Abstract To assess the genetic and environmental components of gene-expression variation among trees we used RNA-seq technology and Eucalyptus urophylla x grandis hybrid clones tested in field conditions. Leaf and xylem transcriptomes of three 20 month old clones differing in terms of growth, repeated in two blocks, were investigated. Transcriptomes were very similar between ramets. The number of expressed genes was significantly (P<0.05) higher in leaf (25,665Â±634) than in xylem (23,637Â±1,241). A pairwise clone comparisons approach showed that 4.5 to 14 % of the genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate [FDR]<0.05) in leaf and 7.1 to 16 % in xylem. An assessment of among clone variance components revealed significant results in leaf and xylem in 3431 (248) genes (at FDR<0.2) and 160 (3) (at FDR<0.05), respectively. These two complementary approaches displayed correlated results. A focus on the phenylpropanoid, cellulose and xylan pathways revealed a large majority of low expressed genes and a few highly expressed ones, with RPKM values ranging from nearly 0 to 600 in leaf and 10,000 in xylem. Out of the 115 genes of these pathways, 45 showed differential expression for at least one pair of genotype, five of which displaying also clone variance components. These preliminary results are promising in evaluating whether gene expression can serve as possible â€˜intermediate phenotypesâ€™ that could improve the accuracy of selection of grossly observable traits.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Alexandre Vaillant"", ids = ""48531982""); list(name = ""Astrid Honvault"", ids = ""112957293""); list(name = ""StÃ©phanie Bocs"", ids = ""2965438""); list(name = ""Maryline Summo"", ids = ""2733078""); list(name = ""Garel Makouanzi"", ids = ""5022447""); list(name = ""Philippe Vigneron"", ids = ""47554604""); list(name = ""Jean-Marc Bouvet"", ids = ""97549058"")",,e5dcc7c1f1a73a27a6aee15b16e795fc702a29e4; 1df4e1fad3e3a1b4236fb8585cdc94ff12c242fb; 0e57b34c22df75a1ac33bdbc0b7943ee413b5c32; 0aa29c91010747979ec10fa581e22424ecacd04d; 56defcc4d278c24e8517a43ad6e739b760622f1d; 04297e23e9658067136304452dd9f6114b870ab1; 3040ac52b3154de53a831715f2ce7f4e7d3d723b; 9b882dc25f43c14fe4de7ab6bdfc3d0c8f038a91; 37cae00437f3d00a8aff2417fe6354137fc04999; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; ddc7ff470f9d13092a1bda90ceca722fdb74b3f8; aa64b8a8bfbedcddd79eee8ba74e1a27de412986; 883e12bb8b81afb2aebcd4d4e07df62460436d69; 571c3ea8cabd16ab0ae7a1a3495d3f3aca918e23; 17d01d94092942d99625e2df0614a03977f64960; 9017547bd9db835f5bf8fb0d8791db541d6944e7; 4cf459485c894b3d26b6195d9de734e6db8d2566; e61c6712ae8bc29da8a95b3299d26f684f92509c; 065d298607c4776d805fa85959e4331b414bb85f; 18e493e7e056365723e7709a3bf8ad67d99ced4b; 6433338ea97ea95409ac5ef618194c663cd9023f; 5a94cedb709e7c7e005f16297a4a3f134b79fcf9; a05f5a5c9fe1d8a44f5960571cc6f4fbb75d0d36; 9b5f10024675930d5d237ff8614f387cb92eec86; 13b1109172846ea3732613f2012179f1607f06c8; 26337a6596cc3f8a0f3256834ea4230730f7f4bd; 0c482ac8dfe58596d25eb6b28da4be0b995aca92; 89578eac44d57985592207a4cb34a519fc01b7f6; dd5a45ef7338851617110d1c3033e1c257fb446c; 3b1bbbe06a2f4715f1bca39f34ecceb3431e5bb9; 482c59e70236266e7bead7c3f92d79f2db311715; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 03c57560cad869d037a6e820ba3faf42d27a8c4a; 51f6c91cd6f678a390e2c147202103999f825068; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 8804202f9f1ee8f9e38fd99d59ca3b5232a75161; 8b81af7d7eab9dd6c6bafaa9856028c83cd447eb; 55e2aa1cb7d6092ce9ab2edb167c45e0a873d21c; 02d966081db0e07bca80ec7fae3873becf47b7c6; 573b632dd8ded90b22479dcbc77c8787205752dd; 2822acd4072cf7089b570f13799e059140246074; c99c023d3a3cbf993848e3ba8bb6ff46d60cf1be; ebd342793ee80999119cf163f5774d649fc0c928; 53adfe99b4cc9c2a1a115de2832d9ead672ab94d; f3218dfcad74785ca5e5806397c81d294609c903; 3930958595bcb6078c3a7b6d7469dcac7f2220e0; 9745833adaa73c55cb41a0dc4fe198e63d3442a2,Silvae Genetica,67,57 - 65
cb17249823ac33f44e3fff2e80af417e5b2506c2,Common single nucleotide polymorphisms at the NPC1L1 gene locus significantly predict cardiovascular risk in coronary patients.,"BACKGROUND
Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) is involved in dietary cholesterol absorption and is the direct molecular target of the LDL-lowering drug ezetimibe. Recently, genetic variants in NPC1L1 have been associated with the incidence of cardiovascular events, but it remains unclear if the impact of NPC1L1 on cardiovascular risk is dependent on its role in cholesterol absorption. Furthermore, no direct association of genetic variants in NPC1L1 with coronary atherosclerosis has been established.


METHODS
To further address these issues, we determined the impact of 34 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the NPC1L1 gene locus on the presence of coronary atherosclerosis and prospectively on future cardiovascular events in a cohort of 984 angiographied Caucasian patients.


RESULTS
Out of investigated SNPs, 24 variants were significantly associated with future cardiovascular events. The highest impact was observed for rs55837134 (sex-and age adjusted additive HR = 1.67 [1.28-2.18]; p = 1.3 e-4). Regression analysis conditioned on rs55837134 showed that significant associations between remaining SNPs at the NPC1L1 locus and vascular events did not persist suggesting their dependence on rs55837134. Its significant association remained almost unchanged after further adjustment for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and other cardiovascular risk factors (additive HR = 1.67 [1.28-2.18]; p = 1.7 e-4). In addition, no significant association of investigated NPC1L1 variants with coronary atherosclerosis could be observed, at least after false discovery rate correction.


CONCLUSIONS
Genetic variants of NPC1L1, particularly rs55837134, show a predictive impact on cardiovascular events. Further studies to determine the molecular consequences of common genetic variants in NPC1L1 are needed.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Axel Muendlein"", ids = ""152855238""); list(name = ""Andreas Leiherer"", ids = ""5954246""); list(name = ""Christoph H.

1b3d026ea39ba56556ccbd0ba575a4a57dd71588,Bayesian pharmacovigilance signal detection methods revisited in a multiple comparison setting.,"Pharmacovigilance spontaneous reporting systems are primarily devoted to early detection of the adverse reactions of marketed drugs. They maintain large spontaneous reporting databases (SRD) for which several automatic signalling methods have been developed. A common limitation of these methods lies in the fact that they do not provide an auto-evaluation of the generated signals so that thresholds of alerts are arbitrarily chosen. In this paper, we propose to revisit the Gamma Poisson Shrinkage (GPS) model and the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) model in the Bayesian general decision framework. This results in a new signal ranking procedure based on the posterior probability of null hypothesis of interest and makes it possible to derive with a non-mixture modelling approach Bayesian estimators of the false discovery rate (FDR), false negative rate, sensitivity and specificity. An original data generation process that can be suited to the features of the SRD under scrutiny is proposed and applied to the French SRD to perform a large simulation study.

A deeper understanding of periodontitis pathophysiology is central to future development of novel biomarkers and therapeutics. The following is reported here: 1) an in silico network model of interactions among cell adhesion molecules and a network-focused microarray analysis of the corresponding genes in periodontitis; 2) analysis of secretions of adhesion molecules in gingival tissue samples from patients with periodontitis and healthy controls; and 3) effect of the human neutrophilic peptide-1 (HNP-1) on epithelial adhesion molecules.


METHODS
The network model identified 85 nodes in relation to the interactions of adhesion molecules. Subsequently, the relative gene expression was overlaid on the network model. Differential gene expression was analyzed, and false discovery rate control was performed for statistical assessment of the microarray data. Both tissue and cell culture samples were immunostained for desmocollin (DSC)2, occludin (OCLN), desmoglein (DSG)1, tight junction protein 2, and gap junction protein Î±.


RESULTS
The differential gene expression analysis revealed that the epithelial adhesion molecules were significantly lower in abundance in individuals with periodontitis than controls. In contrast, the genes for leukocyte adhesion molecules showed a significant upregulation. Immunostainings revealed elevated secretions of both DSG1 and OCLN in periodontitis. An in vitro model suggested reduced DSC2 and OCLN secretions in the presence of HNP-1.


CONCLUSIONS
Gene expression of gingival adhesion molecules in periodontitis is regulated by leukocyte transmigration, whereas the neutrophilic antimicrobial peptide HNP-1 is noted as a putative regulator of epithelial adhesion molecules. These observations contribute to the key mechanisms by which future biomarkers might be developed for periodontitis.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ulvi Kahraman GÃ¼rsoy"", ids = ""37728800""); list(name = ""Fares ZeidÃ¡n-ChuliÃ¡"", ids = ""1402579709""); list(name = ""DoÄŸukan YÄ±lmaz"", ids = ""5542860""); list(name = ""Vural Ã–zdemir"", ids = ""50765298""); list(name = ""Juho MÃ¤ki-PetÃ¤ys"", ids = ""1439056710""); list(name = ""Ben-Hur Neves de Oliveira"", ids = ""8449389""); list(name = ""Yigit Firatli"", ids = ""13417685""); list(name = ""GÃ¼liz Nigar GÃ¼ncÃ¼"", ids = ""6794167""); list(name = ""Feriha Ã‡aÄŸlayan"", ids = ""4283108""); list(name = ""Eija KÃ¶nÃ¶nen"", ids = ""5457397"")",4a7543d5849f700e78644b3a5a046f9362aa020b; 8e051379d0a19665328b65de887037441a43fe57; b0547e667efaec3f117ee081ac2bd3794ea3bc7d; 7e37f240ce98e80af672d9d275cc33b81fff9a29; ca0d5794ebc2576d735995d7a9420188e7fe5b7a; 8e31640fde7fd6a1cb539ec88d4b5820c33197da; 6493bb2f18d8b0bffef8c1841e76006c5a50dd75,,Journal of periodontology,87 2,"

1c9d8918f5630dc270f824eb7f33661b3bef75f3,Genomewide identification of prednisolone-responsive genes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.,"Glucocorticoids are keystone drugs in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To get more insight in signal transduction pathways involved in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, Affymetrix U133A GeneChips were used to identify transcriptionally regulated genes on 3 and 8 hours of prednisolone exposure in leukemic cells of 13 children as compared with nonexposed cells. Following 3 hours of exposure no significant changes in gene expression could be identified. Following 8 hours of exposure, 51 genes were differentially expressed (P < .001 and false discovery rate < 10%) with 39 genes being up-regulated (median, 2.4-fold) and 12 genes were down-regulated (median, 1.7-fold). Twenty-one of those genes have not been identified before to be transcriptionally regulated by prednisolone. Two of the 3 most highly up-regulated genes were tumor suppressor genes, that is, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP; 3.7-fold) and zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 (ZBTB16; 8.8-fold). About 50% of the differentially expressed genes were functionally categorized in 3 major routes, namely MAPK pathways (9 genes), NF-kappaB signaling (11 genes), and carbohydrate metabolism (5 genes). Biologic characterization of these genes and pathways might elucidate the action of glucocorticoids in ALL cells, possibly suggesting causes of glucocorticoid resistance and new potential targets for therapy.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Wim J.

9c0e669821115b1681c1e6b5809ef931c8729003,Circadian pathway genes in relation to glioma risk and outcome,"PurposeThere is growing evidence that circadian disruption may alter risk and aggressiveness of cancer. We evaluated common genetic variants in the circadian gene pathway for associations with glioma risk and patient outcome in a US clinic-based caseâ€“control study.MethodsSubjects were genotyped for 17 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms in ARNTL, CRY1, CRY2, CSNK1E, KLHL30, NPAS2, PER1, PER3, CLOCK, and MYRIP. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate age and gender-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95Â % confidence intervals (CI) for glioma risk under three inheritance models (additive, dominant, and recessive). Proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios for glioma-related death among 441 patients with high-grade tumors. Survival associations were validated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.ResultsA variant in PER1 (rs2289591) was significantly associated with overall glioma risk (per variant allele OR 0.80; 95Â % CI 0.66â€“0.97; ptrendÂ =Â 0.027). The variant allele for CLOCK rs11133391 under a recessive model increased risk of oligodendroglioma (OR 2.41; 95Â % CI 1.31â€“4.42; pÂ =Â 0.005), though not other glioma subtypes (p for heterogeneityÂ =Â 0.0033). The association remained significant after false discovery rate adjustment (pÂ =Â 0.008). Differential associations by gender were observed for MYRIP rs6599077 and CSNK1E rs1534891 though differences were not significant after adjustment for multiple testing. No consistent mortality associations were identified. Several of the examined genes exhibited differential expression in glioblastoma multiforme versus normal brain in TCGA data (MYRIP, ARNTL, CRY1, KLHL30, PER1, CLOCK, and PER3), and expression of NPAS2 was significantly associated with a poor patient outcome in TCGA patients.ConclusionThis exploratory analysis provides some evidence supporting a role for circadian genes in the onset of glioma and possibly the outcome of glioma.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Melissa H.

3df1aae0da4bc21bab8f1c8e6a1d674094770460,A genome-wide association study reveals a novel candidate gene for sperm motility in pigs.,"Sperm motility is one of the most widely used parameters in order to evaluate boar semen quality. However, this trait can only be measured after puberty. Thus, the use of genomic information appears as an appealing alternative to evaluate and improve selection for boar fertility traits earlier in life. With this study we aimed to identify SNPs with significant association with sperm motility in two different commercial pig populations and to identify possible candidate genes within the identified QTL regions. We performed a single-SNP genome-wide association study using genotyped animals from a Landrace-based (L1) and a Large White-based (L2) pig populations. For L1, a total of 602 animals genotyped for 42,551 SNPs were used in the association analysis. For L2, a total of 525 animals genotyped for 40,890 SNPs were available. After the association analysis, a false discovery rate q-value â‰¤0.05 was used as the threshold for significant association. No SNPs were significantly associated with sperm motility in L1, while six SNPs on Sus scrofa chromosome 1 (position 117.26-119.56Mb) were significant in L2. The mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (MTFMT) gene, which affects translation efficiency of proteins in sperm cells, was identified as a putative candidate gene. The significant markers identified in this study may be useful to enhance the genetic improvement of sperm motility by selection of boars at an earlier age under a marker assisted selection strategy.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dayana Barbosa Diniz"", ids = ""144157935""); list(name = ""M S Lopes"", ids = ""14678388""); list(name = ""Marleen Broekhuijse"", ids = ""14826562""); list(name = ""Paulo SÃ¡vio Lopes"", ids = ""143836988""); list(name = ""Barbara Harlizius"", ids = ""4783852""); list(name = ""S E F GuimarÃ£es"", ids = ""145009173""); list(name = ""Naomi Duijvesteijn"", ids = ""5042340""); list(name = ""Egbert F.

3c3c5ee3798a4578b9cb4bdd8e9f5532e055a76a,Pathway analysis of gene expression data from colonic biopsies distinguishes salmon from cod consumers,"Observational studies suggest a possible protective effect of fish consumption in relation to colorectal cancer and such benefits are generally attributed to the high n-3 PUFA content of some species. However, our recent 6-month intervention study, FISHGASTRO, was unable to demonstrate any significant difference in conventional markers of colonic health in salmon as compared to cod consumers. The aim of this study was to assess whether gene expression analysis can provide more sensitive markers of exposure to dietary fish oils. Colonic biopsies were collected from patients with normal mucosal morphology attending gastroenterology clinics in the UK and the Netherlands before and after fish intervention (300 g/week) with either salmon providing c.1.5 g n-3 PUFA/d (n = 15) or cod (n = 16). Gene expression was assessed by microarray analysis. A range of bioinformatics tools was employed to compare differences in biological pathways and processes changed by the intervention in the two groups and with gene sets known to be affected in colonic disease. Change in expression of 1202 genes was significantly different (p<0.05) in salmon as compared to cod consumers (>1.2 FC) but this effect was absent after p-values were corrected for multiple testing using a false discovery rate (FDR) method. However, cluster analysis clearly separated cod from salmon consumers with the exception of two individuals. Gene set enrichment analysis was carried out to compare change in salmon consumers versus change in cod consumers and overlapping gene-sets were identified using Cytoscape software in combination with the Enrichment Map plugin. This analysis revealed that salmon consumption was associated with significantly lower expression of >50 key biological processes as compared to cod consumers, while only 10 biological processes were more highly expressed in salmon consumers. The overlapping gene sets containing the most significantly altered gene sets are shown in the table. Comparison with changes in gene expression patterns from previously published data sets identified 17 common biological functions associated with colorectal cancer and 11 associated with inflammatory bowel disease. In summary, intake of n-3 rich fish such as salmon differentially affects gene expression in colonic biopsies as compared to cod consumption. It is currently too early to fully interpret these data but this approach shows considerable promise in helping to overcome the issues related to the lack of good biomarkers in understanding how diet may impact on cancer risk.

0cf1945bb2d49cd0f8634573efc95e31f54557ea,Association of inflammatory gene polymorphisms with ischemic stroke in a Chinese Han population,"BackgroundInflammatory mechanisms are important in stroke risk, and genetic variations in components of the inflammatory response have been implicated as risk factors for stroke. We tested the inflammatory gene polymorphisms and their association with ischemic stroke in a Chinese Han population.MethodsA total of 1,124 ischemic stroke cases and 1,163 controls were genotyped with inflammatory panel strips containing 51 selected inflammatory gene polymorphisms from 35 candidate genes. We tested the genotype-stroke association with logistic regression model.ResultsWe found two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CCL11 were associated with ischemic stroke. After adjusting for multiple testing using false discovery rate (FDR) with a 0.20 cut-off point, CCL11 rs4795895 remained statistically significant. We further stratified the study population by their hypertension status. In the hypertensive group, CCR2 rs1799864, CCR5 rs1799987 and CCL11 rs4795895 were nominally associated with increased risk of stroke. In the non-hypertensive group, CCL11 rs3744508, LTC4S rs730012, FCER1B rs569108, TGFB1 rs1800469, LTA rs909253 and CCL11 rs4795895 were associated with ischemic stroke.

However, it could be beneficial to evaluate their effects when administered only during critical moments, such as changes in feeding phases. The aim of the trial was to investigate the effect of a commercial plant extract (PE; IQV-10-P01, InQpharm Animal Health, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) on growth performance, blood antiradical activity and cecal microbiome when administered in drinking water to broiler chickens during the post-hatching phase and at each change of diet. In the experiment, 480 1-day-old male broiler chicks were assigned to two groups in a 50-day trial. Broilers received drinking water (C) or drinking water plus PE (T) at a rate of 2 mL/L on days 0 to 4, 10-11 and 20-21. PE did not affect performance and water intake, while total antiradical activity was improved (p < 0.05). A greater abundance of lactic acid bacteria (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) was found in the T group and the result was confirmed at a lower taxonomic level with higher Lactobacillaceae abundance (FDR < 0.05).

Prostate cancer (PC) is generally believed to have a strong inherited component, but the search for susceptibility genes has been hindered by the effects of genetic heterogeneity. The recently developed sumLINK and sumLOD statistics are powerful tools for linkage analysis in the presence of heterogeneity.


METHODS
We performed a secondary analysis of 1,233 PC pedigrees from the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG) using two novel statistics, the sumLINK and sumLOD. For both statistics, dominant and recessive genetic models were considered. False discovery rate (FDR) analysis was conducted to assess the effects of multiple testing.


RESULTS
Our analysis identified significant linkage evidence at chromosome 22q12, confirming previous findings by the initial conventional analyses of the same ICPCG data. Twelve other regions were identified with genome-wide suggestive evidence for linkage. Seven regions (1q23, 5q11, 5q35, 6p21, 8q12, 11q13, 20p11-q11) are near loci previously identified in the initial ICPCG pooled data analysis or the subset of aggressive PC pedigrees. Three other regions (1p12, 8p23, 19q13) confirm loci reported by others, and two (2p24, 6q27) are novel susceptibility loci. FDR testing indicates that over 70% of these results are likely true positive findings. Statistical recombinant mapping narrowed regions to an average of 9 cM.


CONCLUSIONS

Methods ranged from exploratory analyses, to machine learning strategies (neural networks, supervised learning, and tree-based methods), to false discovery rate control of type I errors. The general motivations were to find the ""story"" in the data and to summarize information from a multitude of measures. Several methods illustrated strategies for better trait definition, using summarization of related traits. In the few studies that sought to identify genes for alcoholism, there was little agreement among the different strategies, likely reflecting the complexities of the disease.

We thank Dr Dregelid for his letter regarding our report on the impact of femoral vascular closure devices (VCDs) on major access site bleeding (ASB) in the contemporary ACUITY trial.1 We agree that the main advantage in the VCD group is the significant reduction in large hematomas with a trend toward reduced surgical or percutaneous correction of vascular injury. We would emphasize that large hematomas are not inconsequential because they may cause considerable patient discomfort and prolong hospital stay. We also agree with Dr Dregelid's concern of a high false discovery rate from secondary post hoc analyses.

068e781f47713f81dbaee699ffab48685a6d9a53,Context-sensitive markov models for peptide scoring and identification from tandem mass spectrometry.,"Peptide and protein identification via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) lies at the heart of proteomic characterization of biological samples. Several algorithms are able to search, score, and assign peptides to large MS/MS datasets. Most popular methods, however, underutilize the intensity information available in the tandem mass spectrum due to the complex nature of the peptide fragmentation process, thus contributing to loss of potential identifications. We present a novel probabilistic scoring algorithm called Context-Sensitive Peptide Identification (CSPI) based on highly flexible Input-Output Hidden Markov Models (IO-HMM) that capture the influence of peptide physicochemical properties on their observed MS/MS spectra. We use several local and global properties of peptides and their fragment ions from literature. Comparison with two popular algorithms, Crux (re-implementation of SEQUEST) and X!Tandem, on multiple datasets of varying complexity, shows that peptide identification scores from our models are able to achieve greater discrimination between true and false peptides, identifying up to âˆ¼25% more peptides at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 1%. We evaluated two alternative normalization schemes for fragment ion-intensities, a global rank-based and a local window-based. Our results indicate the importance of appropriate normalization methods for learning superior models. Further, combining our scores with Crux using a state-of-the-art procedure, Percolator, we demonstrate the utility of using scoring features from intensity-based models, identifying âˆ¼4-8 % additional identifications over Percolator at 1% FDR. IO-HMMs offer a scalable and flexible framework with several modeling choices to learn complex patterns embedded in MS/MS data.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Himanshu Grover"", ids = ""47578483""); list(name = ""Garrick L.

We evaluated SNP-environment interactions between 30 confirmed prostate cancer susceptibility loci and 45 pesticides and prostate cancer risk in 776 cases and 1,444 controls in the Agricultural Health Study. We used unconditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multiplicative SNP-pesticide interactions were calculated using a likelihood ratio test. After correction for multiple tests using the False Discovery Rate method, two interactions remained noteworthy. Among men carrying two T alleles at rs2710647 in EH domain binding protein 1 (EHBP1) SNP, the risk of prostate cancer in those with high malathion use was 3.43 times those with no use (95% CI: 1.44-8.15) (P-interaction=â€Š0.003). Among men carrying two A alleles at rs7679673 in TET2, the risk of prostate cancer associated with high aldrin use was 3.67 times those with no use (95% CI: 1.43, 9.41) (P-interaction=â€Š0.006). In contrast, associations were null for other genotypes.

Early interventions aimed at preventing organ failure are hampered by the lack of predictive accuracy of current methods of detecting early dysfunction. Most current markers only detect established organ failure. Sepsis has a profound impact on the metabolic processes necessary to maintain homeostasis and is associated with changes in the metabolic function of many organs. This work targets an unmet clinical need for new and refined diagnostics of acute organ failures by employing a top-down systems biology strategy to elucidate changes in hundreds of low molecular weight metabolites (â€œmetabolic profilesâ€) present in plasma by means of mass spectrometry. Serial plasma samples were collected from 50 patients recruited (mean age 59Â±14, M: F 27:23, APACHE II 21Â±7, 28-day mortality rate 28%), as part of the Vasopressin and Corticosteroids in Septic shock (VACS) randomised controlled trial. All patients received vasopressin therapy and then either steroids or placebo. Overall 154 blood samples were collected throughout time-point 0, days 1, 2 and 7, spun immediately and stored at -80Â°C until analysis. The metabolic profiles of samples were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS). Innovative Recursive Maximum Margin Criterion (RMMC) discriminant analysis was employed to recover metabolic patterns associated with dichotomised liver (SOFA) and kidney (AKIN) failure scores (normal vs any dysfunction). All models were 10-fold cross-validated. The receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was used to assess the diagnostic capacity of multivariate models. The statistical relevance of individual metabolite intensities associated with organ dysfunction was evaluated by empirical Bayesian analysis of variance (ANOVA). The false discovery rate was controlled at a level of 0.05. There were no significant differences in age, sex and number within each treatment arm between either of the pairs of organ failure groups. The prognostic models based on the differentiating metabolic patterns were associated with an overall classification accuracy of 86.4% (sensitivity of 86.5% and specificity 86.3%) and a predictive value of area under ROC (AUROC) of 0.9 for the presence of renal dysfunction. For liver dysfunction the classification accuracy was 90.9% (sensitivity 91.3% and specificity 90.3%) and the predictive value was",2014,,"list(name = ""Heba Lashin"", ids = ""83187147""); list(name = ""Sumati Nadkarni"", ids = ""50884306""); list(name = ""Julia A.

9d8107d34d7fcbc104caea9ab8fe82877da2092c,Whole-genome approach implicates CD44 in cellular resistance to carboplatin,"Carboplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the management of many cancers, yet treatment is limited by resistance and toxicities. To achieve a better understanding of the genetic contribution to carboplatin resistance or toxicities, lymphoblastoid cell lines from 34 large Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain pedigrees were utilised to evaluate interindividual variation in carboplatin cytotoxicity. Significant heritability, ranging from 0.17-0.36 (p = 1 Ã— 10-7 to 9 Ã— 10-4), was found for cell growth inhibition following 72-hour treatment at each carboplatin concentration (10, 20, 40 and 80 Î¼M) and IC50 (concentration for 50 per cent cell growth inhibition). Linkage analysis revealed 11 regions with logarithm of odds (LOD) scores greater than 1.5. The highest LOD score on chromosome 11 (LOD = 3.36, p = 4.2 Ã— 10-5) encompasses 65 genes within the 1 LOD confidence interval for the carboplatin IC50. We further analysed the IC50 phenotype with a linkage-directed association analysis using 71 unrelated HapMap and Perlegen cell lines and identified 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms within eight genes that were significantly associated with the carboplatin IC50 (p < 3.6 Ã— 10-5; false discovery rate < 5 per cent). Next, we performed linear regression on the baseline expression and carboplatin IC50 values of the eight associated genes, which identified the most significant correlation between CD44 expression and IC50 (r2 = 0.20; p = 6 Ã— 10-4). The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction further confirmed a statistically significant difference in CD44 expression levels between carboplatin-resistant and -sensitive cell lines (p = 5.9 Ã— 10-3). Knockdown of CD44 expression through small interfering RNA resulted in increased cellular sensitivity to carboplatin (p < 0.01). Our whole-genome approach using molecular experiments identified CD44 as being important in conferring cellular resistance to carboplatin.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sunita J.

ad7ba30e2fa80f451270ae8933c3451d75edf13f,Neural correlates of RDoC reward constructs in adolescents with diverse psychiatric symptoms: A Reward Flanker Task pilot study.,"BACKGROUND
There has been growing interest under the Research Domain Criteria initiative to investigate behavioral constructs and their underlying neural circuitry. Abnormalities in reward processes are salient across psychiatric conditions and may precede future psychopathology in youth. However, the neural circuitry underlying such deficits has not been well defined. Therefore, in this pilot, we studied youth with diverse psychiatric symptoms and examined the neural underpinnings of reward anticipation, attainment, and positive prediction error (PPE, unexpected reward gain). Clinically, we focused on anhedonia, known to reflect deficits in reward function.


METHODS
Twenty-two psychotropic medication-free youth, 16 with psychiatric symptoms, exhibiting a full range of anhedonia, were scanned during the Reward Flanker Task. Anhedonia severity was quantified using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale. Functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses were false discovery rate corrected for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
Anticipation activated a broad network, including the medial frontal cortex and ventral striatum, while attainment activated memory and emotion-related regions such as the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, but not the ventral striatum. PPE activated a right-dominant fronto-temporo-parietal network. Anhedonia was only correlated with activation of the right angular gyrus during anticipation and the left precuneus during PPE at an uncorrected threshold.


LIMITATIONS
Findings are preliminary due to the small sample size.


CONCLUSIONS
This pilot characterized the neural circuitry underlying different aspects of reward processing in youth with diverse psychiatric symptoms. These results highlight the complexity of the neural circuitry underlying reward anticipation, attainment, and PPE. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of RDoC research in youth.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kailyn A.L.

117f470e589bb22e733a6c14f00adf0a0d56ef7f,General intelligence is associated with subclinical inflammation in Nepalese children: A population-based plasma proteomics study,"Improving child cognition in impoverished countries is a public health priority. Yet, biological pathways and associated biomarkers of impaired cognition remain poorly understood and largely unknown, respectively. This study aimed to explore and quantify associations between functional plasma protein biomarkers and childhood intellectual test performance. We applied proteomics to quantify proteins in plasma samples of 249 rural Nepalese children, 6-8years of age who, 1year later at 7-9years of age, were administered the Universal Nonverbal Intelligence Test (UNIT). Among 751 plasma proteins quantified, 22 were associated with UNIT scores, passing a false discovery rate threshold of 5.0% (q<0.05). UNIT scores were higher by 2.3-9.2 points for every 50% increase in relative abundance of two insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs), six subclasses of apolipoprotein (Apo) and transthyretin, and lower by 4.0-15.3 points for each 50% increase in relative abundance of 13 proteins predominantly involved in inflammation. Among them, IGFBP-acid labile subunit, orosomucoid 1 (ORM1), Apo C-I, and pyruvate kinase isoenzymes M1/M2 jointly explained 37% of the variance in UNIT scores. After additional adjustment for height-for-age Z-score and household socio-economic status as indicators of long-term nutritional and social stress, associations with 6 proteins involved in inflammation, including ORM1, Î±-1-antichymotrypsin, reticulocalbin 1, and 3 components of the complement cascade, remained significant (q<0.05). Using untargeted proteomics, stable, constitutive facets of subclinical inflammation were associated with lower developmental test performance in this rural South Asian child population.

9a64d0d06f4054767cc7513579d1d177669e1764,Genetic variants associated with exercise performance in both moderately trained and highly trained individuals,"Adaptation to exercise training is a complex trait that may be influenced by genetic variants. We identified 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that had been previously associated with endurance or strength performance, exercise-related phenotypes or exercise intolerant disorders. A MassARRAY multiplex genotyping assay was designed to identify associations with these SNPs against collected endurance fitness phenotype parameters obtained from two exercise cohorts (Gene SMART study; nâ€‰=â€‰58 and Hawaiian Ironman Triathlon 2008; nâ€‰=â€‰115). These parameters included peak power output (PP), a time trial (TT), lactate threshold (LT), maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) in recreationally active individuals and a triathlon time-to-completion (Hawaiian Ironman Triathlon cohort only). A nominal significance threshold of Î±â€‰<â€‰0.05 was used to identify 17 variants (11 in the Gene SMART population and six in the Hawaiian Ironman Triathlon cohort) which were significantly associated with performance gains in highly trained individuals. The variant rs1474347 located in Interleukin 6 (IL6) was the only variant with a false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05 and was found to be associated with gains in VO2 max (additional 4.016Â mL/(kgÂ min) for each G allele inherited) after training in the Gene SMART cohort. In summary, this study found further evidence to suggest that genetic variance can influence training response in a moderately trained cohort and provides an example of the potential application of genomic research in the assessment of exercise trait response.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""N.

3fb9138e254403af2eecc670db73cbd1dd2369e6,Gene-environment interaction and maternal arsenic methylation efficiency during pregnancy.,"BACKGROUND
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may influence arsenic methylation efficiency, affecting arsenic metabolism. Whether gene-environment interactions affect arsenic metabolism during pregnancy remains unclear, which may have implications for pregnancy outcomes.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed to investigate main effects as well as potential SNP-arsenic interactions on arsenic methylation efficiency in pregnant women.


METHOD
We recruited 1613 pregnant women in Bangladesh, and collected two urine samples from each participant, one at 4-16â€¯weeks, and the second at 21-37â€¯weeks of pregnancy. We determined the proportions of each arsenic metabolite [inorganic As (iAs)%, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA)%, and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA)%] from the total urinary arsenic level of each sample. A panel of 63 candidate SNPs was selected for genotyping based on their reported associations with arsenic metabolism (including in As3MT, N6AMT1, and GSTO2 genes). We used linear regression models to assess the association between each SNP and DMA% with an additive allelic assumption, as well as SNP-arsenic interaction on DMA%. These analyses were performed separately for two urine collection time-points to capture differences in susceptibility to arsenic toxicity.


RESULT
Intron variants for As3MT were associated with DMA%. rs9527 (Î²â€¯=â€¯-2.98%, PFDRâ€¯=â€¯0.008) and rs1046778 (Î²â€¯=â€¯1.64%, PFDRâ€¯=â€¯0.008) were associated with this measure in the early gestational period; rs3740393 (Î²â€¯=â€¯2.54%, PFDRâ€¯=â€¯0.002) and rs1046778 (Î²â€¯=â€¯1.97%, PFDRâ€¯=â€¯0.003) in the mid-to-late gestational period. Further, As3MT, GSTO2, and N6AMT1 polymorphisms showed different effect sizes on DMA% conditional on arsenic exposure levels. However, SNP-arsenic interactions were not statistically significant after adjusting for false discovery rate (FDR). rs1048546 in N6AMT1 had the highest significance level in the SNP-arsenic interaction test during mid-to-late gestation (Î²â€¯=â€¯-1.8% vs. 1.4%, PGxE_FDRâ€¯=â€¯0.075). Finally, As3MT and As3MT/CNNM2 haplotypes were associated with DMA% at both time points.


CONCLUSION
We found that not all genetic associations reported in arsenic methylation efficiency replicate in pregnant women. Arsenic exposure level has a limited effect in modifying the association between genetic variation and arsenic methylation efficiency.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shangzhi Gao"", ids = ""2948155""); list(name = ""Md Golam Mostofa"", ids = ""46972224""); list(name = ""Quazi Quamruzzaman"", ids = ""6403405""); list(name = ""Mahmudur Rahman"", ids = ""143706432""); list(name = ""Mohammad L Rahman"", ids = ""143673645""); list(name = ""Li Su"", ids = ""145235478""); list(name = ""Yu-Mei Hsueh"", ids = ""143916083""); list(name = ""Marc G.

2820279b573e02363b477be55d4086c3ed7cea89,Gene variations in sex hormone pathways and the risk of testicular germ cell tumour: a case-parent triad study in a Norwegian-Swedish population.,"BACKGROUND
Testicular germ cell tumour (TGCT) is the most common cancer in young men, and an imbalance between the estrogen and androgen levels in utero is hypothesized to influence TGCT risk. Thus, polymorphisms in genes involved in the action of sex hormones may contribute to variability in an individual's susceptibility to TGCT.


METHODS
We conducted a Norwegian-Swedish case-parent study. A total of 105 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 20 sex hormone pathway genes were genotyped using Sequenom MassArray iPLEX Gold, in 831 complete triads and 474 dyads. To increase the statistical power, the analysis was expanded to include 712 case singletons and 3922 Swedish controls, thus including triads, dyads and the case-control samples in a single test for association. Analysis for allelic associations was performed with the UNPHASED program, using a likelihood-based association test for nuclear families with missing data, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. False discovery rate (FDR) was used to adjust for multiple testing.


RESULTS
Five genetic variants across the ESR2 gene [encoding estrogen receptor beta (ERÎ²)] were statistically significantly associated with the risk of TGCT. In the case-parent analysis, the markers rs12434245 and rs10137185 were associated with a reduced risk of TGCT (OR = 0.66 and 0.72, respectively; both FDRs <5%), whereas rs2978381 and rs12435857 were associated with an increased risk of TGCT (OR = 1.21 and 1.19, respectively; both FDRs <5%). In the combined case-parent/case-control analysis, rs12435857 and rs10146204 were associated with an increased risk of TGCT (OR = 1.15 and 1.13, respectively; both FDRs <5%), whereas rs10137185 was associated with a reduced risk of TGCT (OR = 0.79, FDR <5%). In addition, we found that three genetic variants in CYP19A1 (encoding aromatase) were statistically significantly associated with the risk of TGCT in the case-parent analysis. The T alleles of the rs2414099, rs8025374 and rs3751592 SNPs were associated with an increased risk of TGCT (OR = 1.30, 1.30 and 1.21, respectively; all FDRs <5%). We found no statistically significant differences in allelic effect estimates between parental inherited genetic variation in the sex hormone pathways and TGCT risk in the offspring, and no evidence of heterogeneity between seminomas and non-seminomas, or between the Norwegian and the Swedish population, in any of the SNPs examined.

2e8b21453ade409544cc255140b4683f6182ede6,Identification of a novel urothelial carcinoma (UC) biomarker of lethality.,"4569 Background: Limited information exists regarding the changes that occur in UC tumors that ultimately metastasize, the lethal phenotype of UC. Recurrent copy number alterations (CNAs) have been previously identified in UC, but correlation with clinical outcomes has not been reported in metastatic UC.


METHODS
We identified a cohort of 94 UC patients uniformly-treated for distant metastases (platinum-based combination chemotherapy), with clinical annotatation and FFPE primary tumor tissue available. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from start of chemotherapy for metastatic disease to death or last follow-up. Tumor bearing areas were evaluated by a single pathologist, and genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for copy number alterations using Agilent 4x180k high resolution comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays (average resolution of 13kb). Gain and Loss Analysis of DNA (GLAD) was used to segment the array output, and Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) v2 was used to assess the significance of gains/losses (log base 2 ratio > 0.9 and < -1.3, respectively). False discovery rates < 0.2 were considered significant to correct for multiple comparisons. A Cox model for survival controlling for known prognostic variables (PS and visceral metastasis) was used for analysis. Bootstrapping (500 re-samples) assessed the variability and bias of parameters as internal validation.


RESULTS
In the 94 patients (46 deaths) median OS was 15 months. 15 patients were noted to have copy number gain (CNG) of a 150 kb region of 1q23.3. These patients had a median OS of 7.3 months, compared to patients without CNG with a median OS of 18 months. Gain of 1q23.3 is significantly associated with lethal UC (adjusted HR 2.94, 95% CI 1.35-6.44, p=0.007, FDR=0.12) (Table). This finding was internally validated (HR=3.2, 95% CI 1.25-7.2).


CONCLUSIONS
Genomic gain of a short segment of chromosome 1q23.3 is associated with a lethal phenotype of UC in patients with metastatic disease. External validation in an additional cohort is underway.

61eee005e2c4e7c4dca7952326f6953fdfcf71a0,Gene discovery in venous thrombosis: progress and promise.,"AS A RESULT OF RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS IN single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and the availability of appropriate large-scale epidemiological studies and clinical trials, an increasing number of genome-wide association and gene-centric genotyping studies of complex multigenic diseases, such as venous thrombosis and atherosclerosis, are appearing in the literature. Genome-wide association studies take advantage of the fact that SNPs occur in approximately one per thousand base pairs and are common in the population (frequency 1%). Thus, tools such as the recently available 1 millionâ€“SNP chip make it possible to study common genetic variance in coding and noncoding regions across the genome. In contrast, gene-centric genotyping usually focuses on genes likely to be informative and uses specific SNPs that mark functional changes in coding, are in nearby regulatory regions, or are representative of other SNPs residing on local haplotypes. â€œTag-SNPsâ€ representative of human haplotypes can be identified from the human HapMap. A common gene-centric SNP genotyping strategy is to select a small number of candidate genes based on plausible biological roles in the disease of interest. An example of this approach was the study by Smith et al that used 280 SNPs located in 24 venous thrombosis candidate genes and identified 5 SNPs associated with thrombosis risk, including 3 SNPs that were previously unreported. An interesting variation on this approach is the study by Bezemer et al reported in this issue of JAMA. The authors cast a broad net examining 19 682 SNPs in 10 887 genes thereby including nearly half the known genes in the human genome. The authors selected SNPs based on their potential to affect gene function or expression, and on average, analyzed fewer than 2 SNPs per gene. The study populations comprised participants in 2 well-designed case-control studies of deep venous thrombosis, the Leiden Thrombophilia Study (LETS) and the Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of Risk Factors for Venous Thrombosis study (MEGA). With the potential for so many statistical tests, false-positive results are a major issue with this study design. Using a variation on the study design of Shiffman et al, Bezemer et al combined gene discovery with replication and adjusted for the false discovery rate due to multiple testing. The 3 SNPs with the strongest association with venous thrombosis, by the authorsâ€™ most conservative analysis, were in the genes for antithrombin (SERPINC1), the platelet collagen receptor (GP6), and a gene in the cytochrome P450 family 4 (CYP4V2). All 3 were common in the population studied, with allele frequencies ranging from 0.10 to 0.84 and relatively weak additive odds ratios ranging from 1.15 to 1.29. Antithrombin and the platelet collagen receptor are involved in hemostatic pathways and lend themselves to mechanistic hypothesis testing. The CYP4V2 gene is not an obvious candidate for thrombosis risk and either may be an indicator of a novel pathophysiologic pathway leading to thrombosis or may begenetically linkedtoanearbycausalgeneassuggestedbelow. By relaxing their criteria for false discovery rate, the authors identified 4 additional genes possibly associated with venous thrombosis, including the coagulation factor IX gene. They also evaluated additional SNPs near CYP4V2 in a substudy of the LETS and MEGA-1 populations in which they identified 2 more genes in the coagulation pathway: prekallikrein and factor XI. Of these 6 additionally identified genes, 3 are involved in hemostatic pathways and all had weak additive odds ratios. High plasma concentrations of 2 of them, factors IX and XI, have been identified as risk factors for venous thrombosis. Because the evidence for the significance of these additional 6 risk alleles is considerably weaker than for those of the 3 alleles with the strongest association, these observations need further validation. So what are the take-home messages from this work? From the pragmatic perspective of clinical practice, it is reasonable to ask, of what use are risk factors with weak odds ratios? The answer comes in the form of a well-known metric, the population-attributable risk percentage, which is the proportion of the outcome that can be attributed to the risk marker, assuming the risk marker is in the causal pathway. Even a small relative risk can be associated with a large populationattributable risk percentage if the risk marker occurs in a large proportionof thepopulation.Fromthatperspective, the important observations in the study by Bezemer et al are the high",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Edwin G.

Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that targets cyclooxygenase-2, and exhibits anticancer effects. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-GC mechanism of celecoxib using bioinformatics methods. Gene expression datasets GSE56807 (GC tissues and normal gastric tissues) and GSE54657 (celecoxib-treated and non-treated human GC epithelial AGS cells) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Two groups of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using limma package in R language. The criterion for GSE56807 was a false discovery rate of <0.05, while that for GSE54657 was P<0.01. Overlapping DEGs from the two datasets were screened out. Subsequently, pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery software (P<0.1; gene count â‰¥2). In addition, the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) among the overlapped DEGs were obtained based on IntAct, Database of Interacting Proteins, Biomolecular Interaction Network Database and Human Protein Reference Database. Finally, a PPI network was visualized using Cytoscape software. A total of 137 overlapped DEGs were obtained, and DEGs with opposite regulation directions in the two datasets were significantly enriched in focal adhesion and leukocyte transendothelial migration. Subsequently, a PPI network of overlapped DEGs was constructed. Comprehensively, a total of 8 key DEGs [cysteine and glycine rich protein 1 (CSRP1), thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), myosin light chain 9 (MYL9), filamin A (FLNA), actinin alpha 1 (ACTN1), vinculin (VCL), laminin subunit gamma 2 (LAMC2) and claudin 1 (CLDN1)] were upregulated in GC tissues and downregulated in celecoxib-treated cells. In conclusion, celecoxib may exhibit anti-GC effects by suppressing the expression of CSRP1, THBS1, MYL9, FLNA, ACTN1, VCL, LAMC2 and CLDN1, and inhibiting leukocyte transendothelial migration and focal adhesion.

e3c4df56a6cf32c789fb7f70f8d43a3a331498d3,Escaping the Bonferroni iron claw in ecological studies,"I analyze some criticisms made about the application of alphainflation correction procedures to repeated-test tables in ecological studies. Common pitfalls during application, the statistical properties of many ecological datasets, and the strong control of the tablewise error rate made by the widely used sequential Bonferroni procedures, seem to be responsible for some â€˜illogicalâ€™ results when such corrections are applied. Sharpened Bonferroni-type procedures may alleviate the decrease in power associated to standard methods as the number of tests increases. More powerful methods, based on controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), deserve a more frequent use in ecological studies, especially in those involving large repeated-test tables in which several or many individual null hypotheses have been rejected, and the most significant p-value is relatively large. I conclude that some reasonable control of alpha inflation is required of authors as a safeguard against striking, but spurious findings, which may strongly affect the credibility of ecological research. Moran (2003) recently suggested rejecting the application of the sequential Bonferroni rule in ecological studies. He based his proposal on certain mathematical, logical, and practical objections which led him to conclude that it would be better for ecological research to abandon the awkward constraints derived from the sequential Bonferroni rule, allowing the researcher to interpret more freely the multiple test outcomes without testing for alpha inflation. Thereby, detailed ecological research would be stimulated, while avoiding the loss of potentially relevant results, which are at risk of remaining unknown when authors are required to adhere strictly to the sequential Bonferroni rule. The likely increase in the frequency of â€˜false positivesâ€™ in the ecological literature would be of minor importance, since these spurious results will not be confirmed by subsequent experiments. In other contexts, even stronger claims against alpha corrections have recently been the subject of controversy (Perneger 1998, 1999, Feise 2002). Surprisingly few people have questioned the same corrections which are implicit in the standard post hoc methods routinely applied to perform multiple comparisons between treatments for a single dependent variable. Accepting Moranâ€™s arguments, it could be argued that relevant research results are perhaps not being published because people use these alpha-corrected methods instead of looking directly at the individual pairwise-test p-values. There is an apparent inconsistency between the unquestioned acceptance of the â€˜â€˜alpha inflation under repeated testâ€™â€™ principle in the univariate case, and the controversy about the convenience or not of applying the same statistical principle in the multivariate case. Arbitrary rejection of the application of a wellfounded statistical principle does not seem an acceptable scientific solution for a problem.

7f446deec6f54dfdc2444aa234eebfb37a358b03,"Molecular network, pathway, and functional analysis of time-dependent gene changes associated with pancreatic cancer susceptibility to oncolytic vaccinia virotherapy","BACKGROUND
Pancreatic cancer is a fatal disease associated with resistance to conventional therapies. This study aimed to determine changes in gene expression patterns associated with infection and susceptibility of pancreatic cancer cells to an oncolyticvaccinia virus, GLV-1h153, carrying the human sodium iodide symporter for deep tissue imaging of virotherapy.


METHODS
Replication and susceptibility of pancreatic adenocarcinoma PANC-1 cells to GLV-1h153 was confirmed with replication and cytotoxicity assays. PANC-1 cells were then infected with GLV-1h153 and near-synchronous infection confirmed via flow cytometry of viral-induced green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. Six and 24 hours after infection, three samples of each time point were harvested, and gene expression patterns assessed using HG-U133A cDNA microarray chips as compared to uninfected control. Differentially expressed genes were identified using Bioconductor LIMMA statistical analysis package. A fold change of 2.0 or above was used as a cutoff, with a P value of 0.01. The gene list was then analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software.


RESULTS
Differential gene analysis revealed a total of 12,412 up- and 11,065 downregulated genes at 6 and 24 hours postinfection with GLV-1h153 as compared to control. At 6 hours postinfection. A total of 139 genes were either up or downregulated >twofold (false discovery rate < 0.05), of which 124 were mapped by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). By 24 hours postinfection, a total of 5,698 genes were identified and 5,563 mapped by IPA. Microarray revealed gene expression changes, with gene networks demonstrating downregulation of processes such as cell death, cell cycle, and DNA repair, and upregulation of infection mechanisms (P < 0.01). Six hours after infection, gene changes involved pathways such as HMGB-1, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-8, janus kinase/signal tranducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), interferon, and ERK 5 signaling (P < 0.01). By 24 hours, prominent pathways included P53- and Myc-induced apoptotic processes, pancreatic adenocarcinoma signaling, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/v-akt murine thymoma vial oncogene homolog 1 (PI3/AKT) pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study reveals the ability to assess time-dependent changes in gene expression patterns in pancreatic cancer cells associated with infection and susceptibility to vaccinia viruses. This suggests that molecular assays may be useful to develop safer and more efficacious oncolyticvirotherapies and support the idea that these treatments may target pathways implicated in pancreatic cancer resistance to conventional therapies.",2016,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Dana Haddad"", ids = ""121489061""); list(name = ""Nicholas B Socci"", ids = ""50290713""); list(name = ""Chun-hao Chen"", ids = ""48240041""); list(name = ""Nanhai George Chen"", ids = ""3843271""); list(name = ""Qian Zhang"", ids = ""46324597""); list(name = ""Susanne G.

ddec89e7c3442ebec79465264a5ad72f2516534a,Antiaging phenotype in skeletal muscle after endurance exercise is associated with the oxidative phosphorylation pathway,"Background: Performing regular exercise may be beneficial to delay aging. During aging, numerous biochemical and molecular changes occur in cells, including increased DNA instability, epigenetic alterations, cell-signaling disruptions, decreased protein synthesis, reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production capacity, and diminished oxidative phosphorylation. Objectives: To identify the types of exercise and the molecular mechanisms associated with antiaging phenotypes by comparing the profiles of gene expression in skeletal muscle after various types of exercise and aging. Methods: We used bioinformatics data from skeletal muscles reported in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository and used Connection Up- and Down-Regulation Expression Analysis of Microarrays to identify genes significant in antiaging.

3fba88d145ec6b376739dc82e951d59c5baa5d22,The HLJ1-targeting drug screening identified Chinese herb andrographolide that can suppress tumour growth and invasion in non-small-cell lung cancer.,"HLJ1 is a novel tumour suppressor and is a potential druggable target for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this report, using a promoter-containing enhancer region as the HLJ1-targeting drug-screening platform, we identified several herbal compounds from a Chinese herbal bank with the capacity to enhance HLJ1 promoter activity and suppress tumour growth and invasion of NSCLC. Among the herbal drugs identified, the andrographolide (from Andrographis paniculata [Burm. f.] Nees.) most significantly induced HLJ1 expression and suppressed tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo. The andrographolide upregulates HLJ1 via JunB activation, which modulates AP-2Î± binding at the MMP-2 promoter and represses the expression of MMP-2. In addition, silencing of HLJ1 partially reverses the inhibition of cancer-cell invasion by andrographolide. Microarray transcriptomic analysis was performed to comprehensively depict the andrographolide-regulated signalling pathways. We showed that andrographolide can affect 939 genes (analysis of variance, false discovery rate < 0.05) that are dominantly involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis and adhesion-related biological signalling, including mitogen-activated protein kinase, focal adhesion and tight junction pathways, indicating the diverse effects of andrographolide on anticancer invasion and proliferation. In conclusion, the HLJ1-targeting drug-screening platform is useful for screening of novel anticancer compounds. Using this platform, we identified andrographolide is a promising new anticancer agent that could suppress tumour growth and invasion in NSCLC.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yi-Hua Lai"", ids = ""5140555""); list(name = ""Sung-Liang Yu"", ids = ""3392176""); list(name = ""Hsuan-Yu Chen"", ids = ""153924626""); list(name = ""Chi-Chung Wang"", ids = ""121900633""); list(name = ""Huei-Wen Chen"", ids = ""123655539""); list(name = ""Jeremy J.

Identify overlap of the transcriptome of myometrium and cervix in association with human labor.


STUDY DESIGN
The transcriptional profile of myometrial and cervical biopsies obtained from women in spontaneous labor at term (n = 9) and not in labor (n = 9) were characterized by Affymetrix v2 U133 plus 2 arrays. Common canonical pathways and functional groups were identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.


RESULTS
One hundred ten genes (false discovery rate < 1%) were commonly up-regulated by myometrium and cervix in association with labor and 29 genes (false discovery rate < 1%) down-regulated. Fold change in expression of up-regulated genes was strongly correlated; myometrium vs cervix (r = 0.51; P < .001), with no relationship in down-regulated genes (r = 0.26; P = .16). Canonical pathway analysis established up-regulation of inflammatory pathway signaling, with greatest increases in cellular movement and immune response gene ontology groups.

3920f0452f3afb3c8a3b6da8ff7e2508eadd14f1,Classes of multiple decision functions strongly controlling FWER and FDR,"Two general classes of multiple decision functions, where each member of the first class strongly controls the family-wise error rate (FWER), while each member of the second class strongly controls the false discovery rate (FDR), are described. These classes offer the possibility that optimal multiple decision functions with respect to a pre-specified Type II error criterion, such as the missed discovery rate (MDR), could be found which control the FWER or FDR Type I error rates. The gain in MDR of the associated FDR-controlling procedure relative to the well-known Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg procedure is demonstrated via a modest simulation study with gamma-distributed component data. Such multiple decision functions may have the potential of being utilized in multiple testing, specifically in the analysis of high-dimensional data sets.",2015,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Edsel A.

46e8aa2255ba50c18ad5af7dd3c7f703e8ee23e6,Controlling the False Discovery Rate for Feature Selection in High-resolution NMR Spectra,"Successful implementation of feature selection in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra not only improves classification ability, but also simplifies the entire modeling process and, thus, reduces computational and analytical efforts. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) have been widely used for feature selection in NMR spectra. However, extracting meaningful metabolite features from the reduced dimensions obtained through PCA or PLS is complicated because these reduced dimensions are linear combinations of a large number of the original features. In this paper, we propose a multiple testing procedure controlling false discovery rate (FDR) as an efficient method for feature selection in NMR spectra. The procedure clearly compensates for the limitation of PCA and PLS and identifies individual metabolite features necessary for classification. In addition, we present orthogonal signal correction to improve classification and visualization by removing unnecessary variations in NMR spectra. Our experimental results with real NMR spectra showed that classification models constructed with the features selected by our proposed procedure yielded smaller misclassification rates than those with all features.

e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f,Adaptive False Discovery Rate Control under Independence and Dependence,"In the context of multiple hypothesis testing, the proportion Ï€0 of true null hypotheses in the pool of hypotheses to test often plays a crucial role, although it is generally unknown a priori. A testing procedure using an implicit or explicit estimate of this quantity in order to improve its efficency is called adaptive. In this paper, we focus on the issue of false discovery rate (FDR) control and we present new adaptive multiple testing procedures with control of the FDR. In a first part, assuming independence of the p-values, we present two new procedures and give a unified review of other existing adaptive procedures that have provably controlled FDR. We report extensive simulation results comparing these procedures and testing their robustness when the independence assumption is violated. The new proposed procedures appear competitive with existing ones. The overall best, though, is reported to be Storey's estimator, albeit for a specific parameter setting that does not appear to have been considered before. In a second part, we propose adaptive versions of step-up procedures that have provably controlled FDR under positive dependence and unspecified dependence of the p-values, respectively. In the latter case, while simulations only show an improvement over non-adaptive procedures in limited situations, these are to our knowledge among the first theoretically founded adaptive multiple testing procedures that control the FDR when the p-values are not independent.",2009,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Gilles Blanchard"", ids = ""145945278""); list(name = ""Ã‰tienne Roquain"", ids = ""50259561"")",7eccabe7c6899bf8541cd3445c281321428139f4; 5422a2a99870e82ba91ebfb26e8b6ed2227470bc; c93060355830534d0c146fbd3005e7391406aaad; 35aaa29d5bac7d9bd55be0a955d180422b6a9c33; afc8c291aa589389e6c86407c16a5a646daddaaf; 9549db16583a31b0c30d0c620e183643a04e87aa; 0fe28636c4aac89d6aa6101a2eeb4c446d5893ef; 2d9c75dbcd4b7d9fc6f82583521342ea63fbf925; 451c2b09f99f7f99046863e8df49627776838e54; d05f36bdce95eda3df2be3c770bceeeae85770d5; 4c41f150652eb93effac5d98c483914eddea51e0; ab50d8661b6575502b87582d157987fb4de83ba0; bcb1f20b5a52cb340945d7e58526a3a23646046b; ef4fd34d7cd9d5ad065367fd9954967500f5d334; 3d4ba878a6c522beb9d88988543835d9a4e469ad; a28c02d7128658ffa6b465230fb4c306f62e9ccc; d541cad730d918ba005e9afd07d166f11746ed57; 2b51f228cb47ef9de195aaff6c03fae3b41047f6; 1c2ecba69104f49b0c5153fc70462c959063062f; 6623bf5a0d0093722e58a9726f127a58afac0d12; e1218ceea3e1a253a212431d81d10419c798cf3c; c904acd8a43b84324889bf0f35298937adfb78cc; e079efca326f42b0c97648ec09ea585f520758cc; 47722d9bc3b0f51e63e6be52337670d2699c92c9; 7de19f9df35371e467b0f6c1bf7d054799864561; 84ddf26c9a7a27e34e6d3dbaaad1a74b5890f7a7; ace745ec27b3fee7b107654de6f6695e30ebb76b; 47d1f32aa0e760d570fdd57a95280f0618f1003a; b1a2c9e94f92006d9df6874e5dc26669dcde4930; 623029ae0217fc6d3e1a4d5ad1f5704530a5f0c1; a438453add52542eae1a6710dfd5e66990376ed4; c9a7bb3bf94c1421bf4957af43bd2167c3e02d8f; 15b4192d8024b0ef6db4d82ae131289e6e36b701; dd540ea55a1f39644fa8d269988e5876a0538c5f; e6fbec5d97a9b9ec3b04f72079387352752cbab5; 6d3fb1482ea20a3d75d39c0147977e775c1af173; 4a3fdd481386f7f61481af8822254cb90ded0f66; 9b7944d85138c4b6a31f667a6f1c585b8e97cf7c; ff78265a35edeb990632663c53ff8cc506ecdca9; b30ef6d39c299568d63d5b14a17183fbde643964; a3dfc5ae1aea7add5a8ee2d42b27dacd9ad41d31; e7ab79bd98f86e88f8d7d45a450d48085dfd4ca2; d07753fad3b1c25412ff7536176f54577604b1a1; e3159d253d3dc7497604a54f1a907afddbae2fee; 1647e50bbe2cab91768b2debdb2a9cb25be021cb; 35a28bb331fcd2cda4f401b3a2ee22eff3cbf148; 82ca4ab1db887a58e01e1b994c9f38db0eeb31a5; 3da8f768598ae726b128fc9d9474e286d61cd9d2; f46f16ec9ddb69dec6d594ccea38a51ea5e20312; 668288567719a7d837cf367ef86fc015aa03f945; 220d19025c70489a87b139e7fa368dab588cb490; 727b218fbf598e940054b2b76ee6f3501f6cdcc4; fc14992b36f80229598fd8991a4e69787f324e33; 92f3a9e69314d9b6368a30feeb07bafc8b8dc0cf; 601cd78e2afb87d6a29adee64894f347fa3e5452; b20cec40d0687f66c611a79ffd8e0ede9120b9ea; 44519f420c69a776f8cf0bd27afea9d3d615d875; 854d7a2532fb59bebba38833f95825da42bfd17f; cedda598732ea3c959cc5bc6a596c1b303c5c54b,c8c8c29c231a7658c03613a5c7dcd8b136d4c79a; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; d51139172202e5a5e0000415571deaf2b1ac0b72; 15c790cfa8afff058ce02b342ebe20ee7c045750; 1c49766cd3d2e19089fea703e579a73011946ac7; 6d3fb1482ea20a3d75d39c0147977e775c1af173; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf,J.

4526dd12ae002e047c1fcafb3ecb70c4bc60670e,The p-filter: multi-layer FDR control for grouped hypotheses,"In many practical applications of multiple hypothesis testing using the False Discovery Rate (FDR), the given hypotheses can be naturally partitioned into groups, and one may not only want to control the number of false discoveries (wrongly rejected null hypotheses), but also the number of falsely discovered groups of hypotheses (we say a group is falsely discovered if at least one hypothesis within that group is rejected, when in reality the group contains only nulls). In this paper, we introduce the p-filter, a procedure which unifies and generalizes the standard FDR procedure by Benjamini and Hochberg and global null testing procedure by Simes. We first prove that our proposed method can simultaneously control the overall FDR at the finest level (individual hypotheses treated separately) and the group FDR at coarser levels (when such groups are user-specified). We then generalize the p-filter procedure even further to handle multiple partitions of hypotheses, since that might be natural in many applications. For example, in neuroscience experiments, we may have a hypothesis for every (discretized) location in the brain, and at every (discretized) timepoint: does the stimulus correlate with activity in location x at time t after the stimulus was presented? In this setting, one might want to group hypotheses by location and by time. Importantly, our procedure can handle multiple partitions which are nonhierarchical (i.e. one partition may arrange p-values by voxel, and another partition arranges them by time point; neither one is nested inside the other). We prove that our procedure controls FDR simultaneously across these multiple lay- ers, under assumptions that are standard in the literature: we do not need the hypotheses to be independent, but require a nonnegative dependence condition known as PRDS.",2015,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Rina Foygel Barber"", ids = ""32492090""); list(name = ""Aaditya Ramdas"", ids = ""2556942"")",2e5258900ba2f9134dcd5bee4a1f88091a972234; c93060355830534d0c146fbd3005e7391406aaad; d54fc10e8cf6a49682e206576732231c36ae3b98; 73bea1d2c826a44c37cf97f62e73f2d9153d599a; e1bbffda6c897ee0b2030599060e791d57dc3ec1; be9575b3b237a1683df7e97ce2205e7f74ecab09; b4ef47ed4677c58c32adb2f07cd72042a6824106; b0397532153c0978f75bd542b73db0349db8ad1c; 5e834db6e1c7033bd50158742b923bbbad734bc7; ace745ec27b3fee7b107654de6f6695e30ebb76b; 82ca4ab1db887a58e01e1b994c9f38db0eeb31a5,2e9d20f7528cf39b0c940d77d34d2f247cae20f1; c7980dbe0470e041ed17da22250f15fb35f3e73d; 22cebf22de747bd68beb8820406c7c52979ee9ed; 2c4c300672ea8634f4714432cbd54d9f3f9d37b4; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; 0275a62863912b77b01c455d7e2eaa33656b2166; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 8dfeab3c1ba9150c726318b73de2a126b0e0f437; 877d1285540d9f5fbd752d1f40a04cfcd8f380ed; d02249c6d6075f6e52cc395b15f0523de363b654; 3d817620494190605c4c5869258ef4fa93236860; 932c533c94567e9e283f13cb70be71c10b57ca34; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b,arXiv: Methodology,,
a28fac6972eb9c5b766a9308c56e0b1273a44125,Associations between life-course-persistent antisocial behaviour and brain structure in a population-representative longitudinal birth cohort,"BACKGROUND
Studies with behavioural and neuropsychological tests have supported the developmental taxonomy theory of antisocial behaviour, which specifies abnormal brain development as a fundamental aspect of life-course-persistent antisocial behaviour, but no study has characterised features of brain structure associated with life-course-persistent versus adolescence-limited trajectories, as defined by prospective data. We aimed to determine whether life-course-persistent antisocial behaviour is associated with neurocognitive abnormalities by testing the hypothesis that it is also associated with brain structure abnormalities.


METHODS
We used structural MRI data collected at 45 years of age from participants in the Dunedin Study, a population-representative longitudinal birth cohort of 1037 individuals born between April 1, 1972, and March 31, 1973, in Dunedin, New Zealand, who were resident in the province and who participated in the first assessment at 3 years of age. Participants underwent MRI, and mean global cortical surface area and cortical thickness were extracted for each participant. Participants had been previously subtyped as exhibiting life-course-persistent, adolescence-limited, or no history of persistent antisocial behaviour (ie, a low trajectory group) based on informant-reported and self-reported conduct problems from the ages of 7 years to 26 years. Study personnel who processed the MRI images were masked to antisocial group membership. We used linear estimated ordinary least squares regressions to compare each antisocial trajectory group (life-course persistent and adolescence limited) with the low trajectory group to examine whether antisocial behaviour was related to abnormalities in mean global surface area and mean cortical thickness. Next, we used parcel-wise linear regressions to identify antisocial trajectory group differences in surface area and cortical thickness. All results were controlled for sex and false discovery rate corrected.


FINDINGS
Data from 672 participants were analysed, and 80 (12%) were classified as having life-course-persistent antisocial behaviour, 151 (23%) as having adolescence-limited antisocial behaviour, and 441 (66%) as having low antisocial behaviour. Individuals on the life-course-persistent trajectory had a smaller mean surface area (standardised Î²=-0Â·18 [95% CI -0Â·24 to -0Â·11]; p<0Â·0001) and lower mean cortical thickness (standardised Î²=-0Â·10 [95% CI -0Â·19 to -0Â·02]; p=0Â·020) than did those in the low group. Compared with the low group, the life-course-persistent group had reduced surface area in 282 of 360 anatomically defined parcels and thinner cortex in 11 of 360 parcels encompassing circumscribed frontal and temporal regions associated with executive function, affect regulation, and motivation. Widespread differences in brain surface morphometry were not observed for the adolescence-limited group compared with either non-antisocial behaviour or life-course-persistent groups.


INTERPRETATION
These analyses provide initial evidence that differences in brain surface morphometry are associated with life-course-persistent, but not adolescence-limited, antisocial behaviour. As such, the analyses are consistent with the developmental taxonomy theory of antisocial behaviour and highlight the importance of using prospective longitudinal data to define different patterns of antisocial behaviour development.

dcdbc6855b7184265fc508ffe467a44f00a40682,The Trustworthy Pal: Controlling the False Discovery Rate in Boolean Matrix Factorization,"Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) is a popular and powerful technique for inferring knowledge from data. The mining result is the Boolean product of two matrices, approximating the input dataset. The Boolean product is a disjunction of rank-1 binary matrices, each describing a feature-relation, called pattern, for a group of samples. Yet, there are no guarantees that any of the returned patterns do not actually arise from noise, i.e., are false discoveries. In this paper, we propose and discuss the usage of the false discovery rate in the unsupervised BMF setting. We prove two bounds on the probability that a found pattern is constituted of random Bernoulli-distributed noise. Each bound exploits a specific property of the factorization which minimizes the approximation error---yielding new insights on the minimizers of Boolean matrix factorization. This leads to improved BMF algorithms by replacing heuristic rank selection techniques with a theoretically well-based approach. Our empirical demonstration shows that both bounds deliver excellent results in various practical settings.",2018,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sibylle Hess"", ids = ""6585768""); list(name = ""Nico Piatkowski"", ids = ""2374206""); list(name = ""Katharina Morik"", ids = ""1752599"")",90e99e0685c25c0edbc744f9c3c1bfaf7d4932d2; 932fbb8738a0aca2e0c2c8d9365f9d20ba48f526; 71913040b44f323f74cbf863017fbe4917b03c29,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f5016f1f2fc47aeaa983ed7323af34a51aa2473c; 96be192aee9652e4e3b42dce148133768f2d33fe; c4cc1bf5019c030726c77c9a0dcacf7e368fcaf5; 44f0269512a0d93eb8cf8d83a8a55245be16b34c; 1dd3ab8929e099611a7afd4ec4a672401e5952b2; 565213c245cb2c41bd37c99c12bd9c19c695f3fc; 3770927e25cccbe5e0b20dd94d01f2c5dbe05003; acc8b6b916d04e689fde52f81c7c773269b2dfae; 7d1ddf9821ca344bd8e9d56e5af4346c826cb691; cb4330fe065e1034a299211eeb29fe04742e8cf6; 70fb2b55796680f32e8bff6b85e1fbe6c6b8feaf; e720b8b8494b2ea1bc8ecf5841050e0f1fdd84db,ArXiv,abs/1907.00697,

Hearing loss (HL) may be a modifiable risk factor for dementia, and longitudinal studies are needed to examine the association of HL and dementia.


Objective
To investigate the association of HL with incident dementia in Taiwanese adults in the general population.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This population-based cohort study collected data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Patients newly diagnosed with HL from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2011 (nâ€‰=â€‰8135), constituted the exposed (HL) group. The HL group patients were matched by sex, age, residence, and insurance premium to individuals without HL (non-HL group) (nâ€‰=â€‰8135). Data were analyzed from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2013.


Exposure
Hearing loss defined according to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Dementia classified according to ICD-9-CM codes.


Results
Of a total of 16 270 participants (9286 [57.1%] men; mean [SD] age, 65.2 [11.1] years), 1868 developed dementia. The dementia incidence rate in the HL group was higher than that in the non-HL group (19.38 [95% CI, 18.25-20.57] per 1000 person-years vs 13.98 [95% CI, 13.01-15.00] per 1000 person-years) during the follow-up period. In the fully adjusted multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model applied for risk analysis, patients with HL had a significant risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR],â€‰1.17; 95% CI, 1.07-1.29; false discovery rate [FDR] Pâ€‰=â€‰.003). Subgroup analysis revealed that, among 3 age groups (45-64, 65-74, and â‰¥75 years), the group aged 45 to 64 years was associated with a risk of dementia (HR,â€‰2.21 [95% CI, 1.57-3.12]; FDR Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). In sensitivity analysis, the presence of HL among those aged 45 to 64 years (HR,â€‰1.40; 95% CI, 1.12-1.75; FDR Pâ€‰=â€‰.01) was associated with a risk of dementia.


Conclusions and Relevance
In this study, hearing loss was positively associated with a risk of dementia, especially in patients aged 45 to 64 years. Hearing protection, screening, and treatment may be used as strategies for mitigating this potential risk factor.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chin-Mei Liu"", ids = ""151506528""); list(name = ""Charles Tzu-Chi Lee"", ids = ""47499101"")",7570fac56dbf41439cc4bee23c30e762f397290a; 35d90f9d4759e04ff456246f2ab6f818047a3252; 0d4c9b571f4d508e40dbe43f6ec071f9fe1ddf74; c79d3d45b4326f535198e5a4fd0192845a8a795f; c762cc8f53b9225bc0df08557b245ce184ff4f43,,JAMA Network Open,2,

We derive an asymptotic result for the supremum of the expected type I error rate (EER) when the number of hypotheses tends to infinity. Among others, it will be shown that when the original Benjamini-Hochberg step-up procedure controls the FDR at level a, its EER may approach a value being slightly larger than a/4 when the number of hypotheses increases. Moreover, we derive some least favourable parameter configuration results, some bounds for the FDR and the EER as well as easily computable formulae for the familywise error rate (FWER) of two FDR-controlling procedures.

67c0c2b25c285ef04285a55cb52abd0ec932a054,Estimation of Low-Rank Matrices via Approximate Message Passing,"Consider the problem of estimating a low-rank matrix when its entries are perturbed by Gaussian noise. If the empirical distribution of the entries of the spikes is known, optimal estimators that exploit this knowledge can substantially outperform simple spectral approaches. Recent work characterizes the asymptotic accuracy of Bayes-optimal estimators in the high-dimensional limit. In this paper we present a practical algorithm that can achieve Bayes-optimal accuracy above the spectral threshold. A bold conjecture from statistical physics posits that no polynomial-time algorithm achieves optimal error below the same threshold (unless the best estimator is trivial). Our approach uses Approximate Message Passing (AMP) in conjunction with a spectral initialization. AMP algorithms have proved successful in a variety of statistical estimation tasks, and are amenable to exact asymptotic analysis via state evolution. Unfortunately, state evolution is uninformative when the algorithm is initialized near an unstable fixed point, as often happens in low-rank matrix estimation. We develop a new analysis of AMP that allows for spectral initializations. Our main theorem is general and applies beyond matrix estimation. However, we use it to derive detailed predictions for the problem of estimating a rank-one matrix in noise. Special cases of this problem are closely related---via universality arguments---to the network community detection problem for two asymmetric communities. For general rank-one models, we show that AMP can be used to construct confidence intervals and control false discovery rate. We provide illustrations of the general methodology by considering the cases of sparse low-rank matrices and of block-constant low-rank matrices with symmetric blocks (we refer to the latter as to the `Gaussian Block Model').",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Andrea Montanari"", ids = ""145071265""); list(name = ""Ramji Venkataramanan"", ids = ""145720083"")",24e45689e10af2ec822407b69770ad02dc97f1cc; bf9ecf3f5d75ed63baa08848cc7375c9dbabe9cd; c89e520b36a5273e65fd744ac9ed3076d0f85789; b33740686780168f8014abe3d8766b313594876c; 862c218f1c75bba4de025c1a26db5d297de3c619; 4b7c1b0d4c623fa230429c05cfc54d78af1f3c42; 688b87f8e83080a024eb0fd7e55288de313aff8b,3193e23e9b94eef1fae83f3c87769f56c0a4952f; c0591e6158f7cf301e2c86ad81dc00d4c5fa4a26; 212c1395923c0ced838664b045a6178ace97dbee; 6b0345fe5dbf7a8551edd7ae3f56f803fc21378a; cce536dd3cc8d619307716ce8e8e95c4c274b5e9; 50a38c380b8459c64be68e126f306acb2a6f1aae; 3d33b2a9d1fbcc8dbb836a81ed3731d10dd63c86; 2478545659bb4658a16dc73170e068d8b82818c9; 6f24d7a6e1c88828e18d16c6db20f5329f6a6827; 29bae9472203546847ec1352a604566d0f602728; b8277c02343e3911942315b3727cf83753748748; ca73ce2623aa93bf32b88f7fb998af9576aed20f; 381667eec4fb626d3a5352d33aa7ee756b7cd08c; b78c142a5c26781d4be90b0158ef489e2aac429a; 172e3d0750574b6eef10ac9e2ca69b946a3ff1e9; 4bda4c4e03f07d8e9eae0f6bef7645ba7476c453; 4e919b06171a582a18dbdb5a2b760b11b492d443; 7a9626054ab21cc9cbe922ee418edac62354cfcc; ffeee844427bbee931b6f6c3abb8f9f0849de00c; 9d783c26ff670318070d75d3c17f8737ef732c4b; 0396e6451a0ae666f22000370e493807715dbab5; 226e7a7ddb0b3484bd034793c8c2eaf66722c856; 58bf52bf18680b3c6a4169470d38b5dffe3fdd5a; 7c7386bb14d4859ecf7cd3ae56a3b5a13fe15171; e9e87e74d2aa74191acc9b045796e253ca1d1a60; 4b85fa77ecba68ffea9a1d66f7ece8c2fb7af3d4; 60fb4800bf4322f1861743c43c3bbf2ca488f0e1; 0025fc4f00c21960297fbdf83220d6bde75da645; 41f6bbf03e9c2bf1bb2e3cea442a0f08b6d807d0; 225cbd16bf3f529c574866c0b48a21cd8e655601,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,

Each sequential permutation p-value has a null distribution that is nonuniform on a discrete support. We show how to use a collection of such p-values to estimate the number of true null hypotheses m0 among the m null hypotheses tested and how to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) associated with p-value significance thresholds. We use real data analyses and simulation studies to evaluate and illustrate the performance of our proposed approach relative to standard, more computationally intensive strategies. We find that our sequential approach produces similar results with far less computational expense in a variety of scenarios.",2013,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tim Bancroft"", ids = ""3855970""); list(name = ""Chuanlong Du"", ids = ""3439752""); list(name = ""Dan Nettleton"", ids = ""48443856"")",a34668a36fce9e7f5007a609ae0aa98bf7c5aad6; 02fed91af002b6454a074618982590135a56b2b2; 15647f3e30db60410a046b6529fbb641993da38a; 4408131ad304502c6f7e779b8378d31af7bfd8cd; 9051bbb8b8f5ba0befc142374553a91b98454714; da42c918474a75fd46350581b1bf0e04eecb1fc6; 9a1ec18ab93d1de3dd8389284425c1ce9d5c8abc; e2be29d1869fb220d65b99b1a9e145d8301d6cf2; 220d19025c70489a87b139e7fa368dab588cb490; bcf754f3e2a4f587b148fa3b3607934e75d61373; e4d81c752877fc01f78485207157604e567c272d; 249844bb9040acdc26e27b2bc8cef6be7fb851a2; a6f5c6de0ec2719f650cc26cc6f81d81aebac76c; 8453370fdcf98cbc31ea7c92f4aee278810f3d5d; 70a9487987eda75f259a746883b0e39d7d604328,b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 2048aa8f10d832d4ed1608f9188cf47d2ec5e71a; 5ac8d11b5d610101539ca17145982d9c47aaf28d; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; fec121c65654f13109f1826d2dfbf14222e10805; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b198ef350d69f521550ea6f187b89b06933f503a; 68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; eab669a51f7a7321092998cc79150d306d708647; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6,Biometrics,69 1,"

520085aed016f56f3238d9ce8e2d880f734c0b9f,A Statistically Efficient and Scalable Method for Exploratory Analysis of High-Dimensional Data,"Discovering associations among variables is an important data mining task. The associations can be considered as statistical dependencies among random variables, expressed as the structure of an underlying probabilistic graphical model. Current methods for graphical model structure discovery either do not scale well to datasets with large sample sizes, or suffer from high false discovery rates when the number of dimensions is much larger than the sample size. In this paper, we propose a scalable and statistically efficient approach for graphical model structure discovery for multivariate data involving continuous variables. Our approach uses a minimum message length (MML)-based objective, for which we design a greedy algorithm where the best edges maximising improvements to the MML-based score are added incrementally to the graphical model. We present extensive empirical results on synthetic data with different sample, variable, clique and inverse correlation coefficient and show that our method outperforms strong baselines in terms of both speed and the accuracy of the predicted associations among the random variables in the graphical model. We also report that our method performs significantly very well in AML, BRCA cancer data and other real-life datasets.",2020,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Mohammad S.

357a29d507b392c022dc78c11d7353d75810ac55,Improved Detection of Common Variants Associated with Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder Using Pleiotropy-Informed Conditional False Discovery Rate,"Several lines of evidence suggest that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have the potential to explain more of the ""missing heritability"" of common complex phenotypes. However, reliable methods to identify a larger proportion of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that impact disease risk are currently lacking. Here, we use a genetic pleiotropy-informed conditional false discovery rate (FDR) method on GWAS summary statistics data to identify new loci associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorders (BD), two highly heritable disorders with significant missing heritability. Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggest similar disease characteristics and overlapping genes between SCZ and BD. Here, we computed conditional Q-Q curves of data from the Psychiatric Genome Consortium (SCZ; n = 9,379 cases and n = 7,736 controls; BD: n = 6,990 cases and n = 4,820 controls) to show enrichment of SNPs associated with SCZ as a function of association with BD and vice versa with a corresponding reduction in FDR. Applying the conditional FDR method, we identified 58 loci associated with SCZ and 35 loci associated with BD below the conditional FDR level of 0.05. Of these, 14 loci were associated with both SCZ and BD (conjunction FDR). Together, these findings show the feasibility of genetic pleiotropy-informed methods to improve gene discovery in SCZ and BD and indicate overlapping genetic mechanisms between these two disorders.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ole Andreas Andreassen"", ids = ""1777021""); list(name = ""Wesley K.

f54f6114de90c1f4b179db0e91c9554124c80429,Proline betaine and its biotransformation products in fasting urine samples are potential biomarkers of habitual citrus fruit consumption.,"The lack of robust measures of dietary exposure hinders a quantitative understanding of causal relationships between diet and health. Non-targeted metabolite fingerprinting was used to explore the relationships between citrus exposure in free-living human subjects, estimated by a FFQ, and the chemical content of urine. Volunteers (study 1, n 12; study 2, n 11) were classified into high-, medium- and low-frequency citrus consumption groups. Overnight and spot fasting urine samples were obtained after exposure to a standardised citrus-free evening meal. The urine samples were analysed by flow injection electrospray-ionisation MS followed by supervised multivariate data classification analysis to discover discriminatory features associated with the level of citrus exposure. Good separation of high and low citrus consumption classes was achieved. Deeper exploration of high-ranked explanatory mass signals revealed several correlated signals derived from proline betaine. Targeted analysis of the relative levels of proline betaine in both fasting and overnight urine samples demonstrated good correlation with FFQ exposure data. Acute exposure of volunteers to orange juice resulted in the appearance of proline betaine and several biotransformed products in postprandial urine samples. Biomarker validation showed sensitivities of 80Â·8-92Â·2Â % and specificities of 74Â·2-94Â·1Â % (false discovery rate-adjusted P values <Â 0Â·05) for elevated proline betaine in participants who reported high citrus consumption. Proline betaine biotransformation products displayed weaker quantitative relationships with habitual citrus exposure. Targeted screening for the presence of biotransformation products of hesperidin and narirutin, known to be abundant in oranges, revealed that they were relatively poor indicators of citrus exposure.",2011,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Amanda J Lloyd"", ids = ""3298880""); list(name = ""Manfred Beckmann"", ids = ""143709218""); list(name = ""G Ã§Delle Fave"", ids = ""36329004""); list(name = ""John C.

3de5790fcc7fd23066b1015ca264618aa4c5f35b,Association between occupational exposure to trichloroethylene and serum levels of microRNAs: a cross-sectional molecular epidemiology study in China,"ObjectivesThe objective of our study was to evaluate the association between occupational exposure to trichloroethylene (TCE), a suspected lymphomagen, and serum levels of miRNAs in a cross-sectional molecular epidemiology study of TCE-exposed workers and comparable unexposed controls in China.MethodsSerum levels of 40 miRNAs were compared in 74 workers exposed to TCE (median: 12Â ppm) and 90 unexposed control workers. Linear regression models were used to test for differences in serum miRNA levels between exposed and unexposed workers and to evaluate exposureâ€“response relationships across TCE exposure categories using a three-level ordinal variable [i.e., unexposed,â€‰<â€‰12Â ppm, the median value among workers exposed to TCE) andâ€‰â‰¥â€‰12Â ppm)]. Models were adjusted for sex, age, current smoking, current alcohol use, and recent infection.ResultsSeven miRNAs showed significant differences between exposed and unexposed workers at FDR (false discovery rate)â€‰<â€‰0.20. miR-150-5p and let-7b-5p also showed significant inverse exposureâ€“response associations with TCE exposure (Ptrend=â€‰0.002 and 0.03, respectively).

73480381b4e62769d34a809508ad8980fb9f053e,Microarray-based Prediction of Cytotoxicity of Tumor Cells to Arsenic Trioxide.,"Arsenic has been used since ancient times as a medicinal agent. Currently, arsenic trioxide is experiencing a thriving revival in modern oncology. The aim of this study was to identify the molecular predictors of sensitivity and resistance to arsenic trioxide. We mined the microarray database of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA, for genes whose expression correlated with the IC50 values for arsenic trioxide of 60 cell lines of different tumor types. By COMPARE analysis, Kendall's Ï„ test, and false discovery rate (FDR) analyses, 47 out of 9706 genes or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were identified. If the mRNA expression of the 47 genes or ESTs was subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and cluster image mapping, sensitivity or resistance of the 60 cell lines to arsenic trioxide was predictable with statistical significance (p=1.01 Ã— 10-5). While the proteins encoded by the 47 genes identified differ in their specific functions (signal transducers, transcription factors, proteasome degradation proteins, proliferation-related proteins, regulators of oxidative stress etc.), it is intriguing that many of them are in one way or another involved in the apoptotic machinery, indicating that apoptosis is an important mechanism of arsenic trioxide's cytotoxicity.",2004,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Thomas Efferth"", ids = ""3131602""); list(name = ""Bernd Kaina"", ids = ""144553462"")",bc5ce4262a355be5e45977bd8c9e647dd9887105; 015f565873c32321183a39637a5f22ad1263cd5c; 2e0c94e7f4f996480f683695ecf89e989ef14599; 1d75906e20a0f11581db85c859c982e0321a466e; ba01c62902abda88ec0aebe4c03372a87217d79e; 68c333e37e6967da4a1111984b5c4df1e72e515f; 6692fbba6db0afbb2cfbeb8532860f9381330c4f; 81bc479b3e4ac2526d6c5353a66d4fd756ba1de1,,Cancer genomics & proteomics,1 5-6,"

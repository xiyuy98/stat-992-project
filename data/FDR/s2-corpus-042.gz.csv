90e21d0991af8cca392916923ce1e0ac447ea394,"RNALfoldz: Efficient Prediction of Thermodynamically Stable, Local Secondary Structures",The search for local RNA secondary structures and the annotation of unusually stable folding regions in genomic sequences are two well motivated bioinformatic problems. In this contribution we introduce RNALfoldz an efficient solution two tackle both tasks. It is an extension of the RNALfold algorithm augmented by support vector regression for efficient calculation of a structureâ€™s thermodynamic stability. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach on the genome of E. coli and investigate a potential strategy to determine z-score cutoffs given a predefined false discovery rate.,2010,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Andreas R.

528b1f61d0f8a758a65fb96a1a8f36e7ec9e97fa,Determination and comparison of the Francisella tularensis subsp.novicida U112 proteome to other bacterial proteomes.,"The proteins expressed by Francisella tularensis subsp. novicida U112 grown to midexponential phase were surveyed by nanoLC-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). To improve annotation of the genome and develop a technology to provide high-throughput analysis of the Francisella proteome in multiple conditions, we sought to establish a fast and simple analysis that would reduce as much as possible the false discovery rate. Our survey detected expression of 63.0% of the predicted proteome from the stable condition of growth in rich medium available at (www.francisella.org). On the basis of detection of essential proteins, we estimated coverage to be approximately 80% of the actual expressed proteome. This suggests that no less than 70% of the proteins could be expressed in this condition. This analysis revealed two previously unidentified protein coding open reading frames and validated 50% of the proteins annotated as hypothetical. On the basis of results of the screen to detect essential proteins, not all proteins expressed provide a measurable contribution to F.t. novicida growth in this condition. Comparison of this protein profile with other profiles previously published suggested that the genome size and number of genes involved in regulation have little effect on the number of proteins expressed in a given stable condition.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Laurence Rohmer"", ids = ""2465346""); list(name = ""Tina Guina"", ids = ""3888191""); list(name = ""Jinzhi Chen"", ids = ""38373194""); list(name = ""Byron M Gallis"", ids = ""4172458""); list(name = ""Greg K.

10cd3b57afd0654c8a69063bf26c1cd089de34d8,"Beyond Bonferroni revisited: concerns over inflated false positive research findings in the fields of conservation genetics, biology, and medicine","In 2006, Narum published a paper in Conservation Genetics emphasizing that Bonferroni correction for multiple testing can be highly conservative with poor statistical power (high Type II error). He pointed out that other approaches for multiple testing correction can control the false discovery rate (FDR) with a better balance of Type I and Type II errors and suggested that the approach of Benjamini and Yekutieli (BY) 2001 provides the most biologically relevant correction for evaluating the significance of population differentiation in conservation genetics. However, there are crucial differences between the original Benjamini and Yekutieli procedure and that described by Narum. After carefully reviewing both papers, we found an error due to the incorrect implementation of the BY procedure in Narum (Conserv Genet 7:783â€“787, 2006) such that the approach does not adequately control FDR. Since the incorrect BY approach has been increasingly used, not only in conservation genetics, but also in medicine and biology, it is important that the error is made known to the scientific community. In addition, we provide an overview of FDR approaches for multiple testing correction and encourage authors first and foremost to provide effect sizes for their results; and second, to be transparent in their descriptions of multiple testing correction. Finally, the impact of this error on conservation genetics and other fields will be study-dependent, as it is related to the number of true to false positives for each study.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Tonya White"", ids = ""49940284""); list(name = ""Jan van der Ende"", ids = ""2738617""); list(name = ""Thomas E.

9152e95cf7bc61e60f22ebf682eaab06e95b006d,Identification of differentially expressed peptides in highâ€throughput proteomics data,"&NA; With the advent of highâ€throughput proteomics, the type and amount of data pose a significant challenge to statistical approaches used to validate current quantitative analysis. Whereas many studies focus on the analysis at the protein level, the analysis of peptideâ€level data provides insight into changes at the subâ€protein level, including splice variants, isoforms and a range of postâ€translational modifications. Statistical evaluation of liquid chromatographyâ€mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry peptideâ€based labelâ€free differential data is most commonly performed using a tâ€test or analysis of variance, often after the application of data imputation to reduce the number of missing values. In highâ€throughput proteomics, statistical analysis methods and imputation techniques are difficult to evaluate, given the lack of gold standard data sets. Here, we use experimental and resampled data to evaluate the performance of four statistical analysis methods and the added value of imputation, for different numbers of biological replicates. We find that three or four replicates are the minimum requirement for highâ€throughput data analysis and confident assignment of significant changes. Data imputation does increase sensitivity in some cases, but leads to a much higher actual false discovery rate. Additionally, we find that empirical Bayes method (limma) achieves the highest sensitivity, and we thus recommend its use for performing differential expression analysis at the peptide level.",2018,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michiel P. van Ooijen"", ids = ""1397960895""); list(name = ""Victor L.

9cc8bd5dd1fdb710fbfa8dc418bcd1c881dcc64a,Medical morbidities and DNA methylation of NR3C1 in preterm infants,"Background:Although there are no accepted â€œnormalâ€ levels of circulating cortisol in preterm infants, critically ill preterm infants show lower cortisol levels than healthy preterm infants. The regulation of cortisol reactivity by epigenetic changes in glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) expression has been demonstrated. This study aims to examine the relationship between medical morbidities in preterm infants and DNA methylation of NR3C1.Methods:Pyrosequencing was used to determine DNA methylation in CpG sites 1-4 of promoter region 1F of NR3C1. Cluster analysis placed 67 preterm infants born <1,500â€‰g into groups based on medical morbidities. The DNA methylation pattern was compared across groups.Results:Cluster analysis identified a high medical risk cluster and a low medical risk cluster. A Mann-Whitney U-test showed lower methylation at CpG1 for infants in the high-risk group (M = 0.336, SE = 0.084) than infants in the low-risk group (M = 0.617, SE = 0.109, P = 0.032). The false discovery rate was low (q = 0.025). Cohenâ€™s D effect size was moderate (0.525).Conclusion:Decreased DNA methylation of CpG1 of NR3C1 in high-risk infants may allow for increased binding of transcription factors involved in the stress response, repair and regulation of NR3C1. This may ensure healthy growth in high-risk preterm infants over increasing cortisol levels.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""James Giarraputo"", ids = ""9519090""); list(name = ""Jordan DeLoach"", ids = ""144457807""); list(name = ""James Padbury"", ids = ""143644748""); list(name = ""Alper Uzun"", ids = ""3259091""); list(name = ""Carmen J.

Convection-permitting climate models have been recommended for use in
projecting future changes in local-scale, short-duration rainfall extremes
that are of the greatest relevance to engineering and infrastructure design,
e.g., as commonly summarized in intensityâ€“durationâ€“frequency (IDF) curves.
Based on thermodynamic arguments, it is expected that rainfall extremes will
become more intense in the future. Recent evidence also suggests that
shorter-duration extremes may intensify more than longer durations and that
changes may depend on event rarity. Based on these general trends, will IDF
curves shift upward and steepen under global warming? Will long-return-period
extremes experience greater intensification than more common events?
Projected changes in IDF curve characteristics are assessed based on
sub-daily and daily outputs from historical and late 21st century
pseudo-global-warming convection-permitting climate model simulations over
North America. To make more efficient use of the short model integrations, a
parsimonious generalized extreme value simple scaling (GEVSS) model is used
to estimate historical and future IDF curves (1 to 24â€‰h durations).
Simulated historical sub-daily rainfall extremes are first evaluated against
in situ observations and compared with two high-resolution
observationally constrained gridded products. The climate model performs
well, matching or exceeding performance of the gridded datasets. Next,
inferences about future changes in GEVSS parameters are made using a Bayesian
false discovery rate approach. Large portions of the domain experience
significant increases in GEVSS location ( >99 â€‰% of grid points), scale
( >88 â€‰%), and scaling exponent ( >39 â€‰%) parameters, whereas almost no
significant decreases are projected to occur ( â€‰%, â€‰%, and â€‰%
respectively). The result is that IDF curves tend to shift upward (increases
in location and scale), and, with the exception of the eastern US,
steepen (increases in scaling exponent), which leads to the largest increases
in return levels for short-duration extremes. The projected increase in the
GEVSS scaling exponent calls into question stationarity assumptions that form
the basis for existing IDF curve projections that rely exclusively on
simulations at the daily timescale. When changes in return levels are scaled
according to local temperature change, median scaling rates, e.g., for the
10-year return level, are consistent with the Clausiusâ€“Clapeyron (CC) relation
at 1 to 6â€‰h durations, with sub-CC scaling at longer durations and modest
super-CC scaling at sub-hourly durations. Further, spatially coherent but
small increases in dispersion â€“ the ratio of scale and location parameters
â€“ of the GEVSS distribution are found over more than half of the domain,
providing some evidence for return period dependence of future changes in
extreme rainfall.",2019,Geology,"list(name = ""Alex J.

Integrating this information with high-throughput functional genomics data can help identifying networks associated with complex diseases and phenotypes. Here we propose a unified statistical framework to test network properties of single and multiple genesets. We focused on testing whether a geneset exhibits network properties and if two genesets are strongly interacting with each other. We then assessed power and false discovery rate of the proposed tests, showing that tests based on a probabilistic model of gene and protein interaction are the most robust. We implemented our tests in an open-source framework, called Python Geneset Network Analysis (PyGNA), which provides an integrated environment for network studies. While most available tools are designed as web applications, we designed PyGNA to be easily integrated into existing high-performance data analysis pipelines.

The goal of the present study was to identify novel variants that associate with response to common asthma controllers: fluticasone, combination of fluticasone + salmeterol and montelukast with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Î²2-adrenergic receptor, corticosteroid and leukotriene pathway candidate genes. Participants in a large clinical trial of step-down strategies volunteered for this pharmacogenetic study. A total of 169 SNPs in 26 candidate genes were genotyped in 189 Caucasian participants with asthma who took either fluticasone (100â€‰Î¼g bid), fluticasone propionate (100â€‰Î¼g) + salmeterol (50â€‰Î¼g) (FP/Salm) or montelukast (5 or 10â€‰mg) each night for 16 weeks. Primary outcomes were the slopes of plots of Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores versus time following randomization; and the percent change in percent predicted FEV1 (Î”FEV1%pred) from enrollment to the end of the study. Associations between SNPs and outcomes were analyzed using general linear models. False discovery rate and Bonferroni corrections were used to correct for multiple comparisons. In all, 16 SNPs in seven genes were significantly associated with outcomes. For FP/Salm, three SNPs in CHRM2 associated with ACQ slope (P=2.8 Ã— 10âˆ’5), and rs1461496 in HSPA8 associated with Î”FEV1%pred. For fluticasone, five SNPs in CRHR1 (P=1.9 Ã— 10âˆ’4), and three SNPs in COL2A1 associated with ACQ slope and Î”FEV1%pred, respectively. For montelukast, four SNPs in CHRM2 associated with Î”FEV1%pred and predicted an opposite effect compared with fluticasone (P=9 Ã— 10âˆ’3).

ee9589dc4da141fd4aec1c3a5809ccad5f355149,Differential gene expression signatures between colorectal cancers with and without KRAS mutations: crosstalk between the KRAS pathway and other signalling pathways.,"PURPOSE
KRAS mutation is an important predictive marker in determining resistance to anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antibody therapies. In order to clarify whether not only KRAS related signalling pathways but also other signalling pathways are altered in patients with colorectal cancers (CRCs) with KRAS mutations, we examined the differences in the gene expression signatures between CRCs with and without KRAS mutation.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
One-hundred and thirteen patients who underwent a surgical resection of a primary CRC were examined. KRAS mutational status was determined using the Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA)-clamp real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) TaqMan assay. Gene expression profiles were compared between CRCs with and without KRAS mutation using the Human Genome GeneChip array U133.


RESULTS
Among 113 CRCs, KRAS mutations were present in 35 tumours (31%). We identified 30 genes (probes) that were differentially expressed between CRCs with and without KRAS mutation (False Discovery Rate (FDR), p<0.01), by which we were able to predict the KRAS status with an accuracy of 90.3%. Thirty discriminating genes included TC21, paired-like homeodomain 1 (PITX1), Sprouty-2, dickkopf homologue 4 (DKK-4), SET and MYND domain containing 3 (SMYD3), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 14 (MAP3K14) and c-mer Proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK). These genes were related to not only KRAS related signalling pathway but also to other signalling pathways, such as the Wnt-signalling pathway, the NF-kappa B activation pathway and the TGF-beta signalling pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
KRAS mutant CRCs exhibited a distinct gene expression signature different from wild-type KRAS CRCs. Using human CRC samples, we were able to show that there is crosstalk between the KRAS-mediated pathway and other signalling pathways. These results are necessary to be taken into account in establishing chemotherapeutic strategies for patients with anti-EGFR-refractory KRAS mutant CRCs.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Toshiaki Watanabe"", ids = ""2258935""); list(name = ""Takashi Kobunai"", ids = ""8331555""); list(name = ""Yoko Yamamoto"", ids = ""30257896""); list(name = ""Keiji Matsuda"", ids = ""4369702""); list(name = ""Soichiro Ishihara"", ids = ""6712921""); list(name = ""Keijiro Nozawa"", ids = ""5776736""); list(name = ""Hisae Iinuma"", ids = ""34739152""); list(name = ""Hiroki Ikeuchi"", ids = ""2158706""); list(name = ""Kiyoshi Eshima"", ids = ""10164294"")",4a56bc00dba26ff209b6603bf801d1eca2700640; 033eadf73d514b31444aa6496e41e666bd2162d5; 093437d9f787c7f82e80f7a819f6889ae84feb38; 804c6d3d02c87982b5d2b91910ef895cc78e2022; e0b32733153fe3720b89226acbbd00b1b4fe1d1f; 97103e31547138b061cb65a9c2d1864a4ef28a03; 94ebc86f18f203ff28675d969742d140f47a8e83; 48e4b5f0c3ea62435accbe0363b1f6f59e883a79; 967e46ea233d3b9515d4ea84fb0c46d0dbb23a81; 4a3400b3f92ab94dadc6d386f933bc1fbb83a773; a3b338199f7b3c2f5617e54cc4107bba267035a9; 6fa06902a2892e824cfbe2b38225b43d97fd45d8; 7d034c23555b362f1c6acae41dee532090dfe37d; 8c1099490d9d7466b0c4788d4fcc7639bb13bbf1; 575f18f55bfbbe54187e72d26bac696cf03c6a26; b24bb9347ef2758fde3499a1d6e79d4331a76d83; c74aabc5977c29b35e4269d2b5dfb460bbe0df24; 863a018ec8c9612cb7314d5dbb4f997be71dda2d; 1e1840e2d7b6363281b2e404a7609422c6afedc3; 785b30e6ceba2ceb7fad0cfe19e9f0f0f2ff6d0f; 1318693dc9acb5ffd1775821f78647d96efd0c0f; 600176706adca5760144d32cafc0c99087ad3ef0; a8e89b86a84432b7576133c17a4ac020c5759144; e178f57b6409c1ac2447d639e958a918014cd0e8; d5414c932fdf04d9c60c95c1c96394ccfa004526; ada9bc02772ff75f4c31f8d3e9bba9b5fd8ec4c2; fa095d934057d474e266434763d8c5bffa3701b1; e389c114c224b41b20c5367e2be477b4302b0f14; 15e609fcca46bd6835ea2664bd3181b16cf0c3df; 2f464a278bb92fdf87f5c91b66111dc7a43c679b; fe0b6e013cdaf45e4048292e30336ed58fd1161e; 7206cf86c5d86f8d3a562174740afb24e7b98d76; d8f9a11fb6a2cb4bd2d27607f3afd8a1584fcd79,,European journal of cancer,47 13,"

2ccdb5fcfe1078661e4f8e78ce45f834a31839a2,Improving Power of Genome-Wide Association Studies with Weighted False Discovery Rate Control and Prioritized Subset Analysis,"The issue of large-scale testing has caught much attention with the advent of high-throughput technologies. In genomic studies, researchers are often confronted with a large number of tests. To make simultaneous inference for the many tests, the false discovery rate (FDR) control provides a practical balance between the number of true positives and the number of false positives. However, when few hypotheses are truly non-null, controlling the FDR may not provide additional advantages over controlling the family-wise error rate (e.g., the Bonferroni correction). To facilitate discoveries from a study, weighting tests according to prior information is a promising strategy. A 'weighted FDR control' (WEI) and a 'prioritized subset analysis' (PSA) have caught much attention. In this work, we compare the two weighting schemes with systematic simulation studies and demonstrate their use with a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on type 1 diabetes provided by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. The PSA and the WEI both can increase power when the prior is informative. With accurate and precise prioritization, the PSA can especially create substantial power improvements over the commonly-used whole-genome single-step FDR adjustment (i.e., the traditional un-weighted FDR control). When the prior is uninformative (true disease susceptibility regions are not prioritized), the power loss of the PSA and the WEI is almost negligible. However, a caution is that the overall FDR of the PSA can be slightly inflated if the prioritization is not accurate and precise.

f9054b7814eaabf12228ae0072ab17056ba988a6,Wnt5a participates in hepatic stellate cell activation observed by gene expression profile and functional assays.,"AIM
To identify differentially expressed genes in quiescent and activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and explore their functions.


METHODS
HSCs were isolated from the normal Sprague Dawley rats by in suit perfusion of collagenase and pronase and density Nycodenz gradient centrifugation. Total RNA and mRNA of quiescent HSCs, and culture-activated HSCs were extracted, quantified and reversely transcripted into cDNA. The global gene expression profile was analyzed by microarray with Affymetrix rat genechip. Differentially expressed genes were annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) and analyzed with Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. Microarray data were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The function of Wnt5a on human HSCs line LX-2 was assessed with lentivirus-mediated Wnt5a RNAi. The expression of Wnt5a in fibrotic liver of a carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced fibrosis rat model was also analyzed with Western blotting.


RESULTS
Of the 28â€…700 genes represented on this chip, 2566 genes displayed at least a 2-fold increase or decrease in expression at a P < 0.01 level with a false discovery rate. Of these, 1396 genes were upregulated, while 1170 genes were downregulated in culture-activated HSCs. These differentially expressed transcripts were grouped into 545 GO based on biological process GO terms. The most enriched GO terms included response to wounding, wound healing, regulation of cell growth, vasculature development and actin cytoskeleton organization. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that Wnt5a signaling pathway participated in the activation of HSCs. Wnt5a was significantly increased in culture-activated HSCs as compared with quiescent HSCs. qRT-PCR validated the microarray data. Lentivirus-mediated suppression of Wnt5a expression in activated LX-2 resulted in significantly impaired proliferation, downregulated expressions of typeâ€…Iâ€…collagen and transforming growth factor-Î²1. Wnt5a was upregulated in the fibrotic liver of a CCl(4)-induced fibrosis rat model.


CONCLUSION
Wnt5a is involved in the activation of HSCs, and it may serve as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of liver fibrosis.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wu-jun Xiong"", ids = ""8573897""); list(name = ""Li-juan Hu"", ids = ""6384579""); list(name = ""Yi-cheng Jian"", ids = ""4939082""); list(name = ""Li-Jing Wang"", ids = ""39386501""); list(name = ""Ming Jiang"", ids = ""144889908""); list(name = ""Wei Li"", ids = ""47112863""); list(name = ""Yi He"", ids = ""50878899"")",3ffaef238dbacfdf64e20d9b11f9adfd29ec479a; b9d0fb4b20091b946bd4c81e05a6f14cf9337670; 4e779bb6be61c9178107804469152ca82978f0b1; 7b6a2827e3800d2fb7d99c7c8a129686fda0dc38; dcdc7513097f6b26dc939dee8b6d951ec9ccfa4b; a213344db4fadf92eef2946a9766a6efe0eba649; 648e84e2ee2662eb6584237008b8d95bdd10f638; 14293d2e58ad3b9ee9cdba47f544fe7e684ab49b; 92cadf603de82f88e72c973181c5ce1b5f0bd492; 7553c7141f8815ab85931b785ed85edc7c980ad2; 018570aebf5deaff1d4bbe74494126945f493e45; 60eb6806885cd48cd2f6303a3dc05045121958ac; 7cdc13d6ec330ece09d86ae9b0e98505e5ae17a4; 688a25e15e16114b44730c2551a2ee5cf9d305db,,World journal of gastroenterology,18 15,"

In this study, 954 F(2) animals were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting carcass and meat quality traits. Based on results of the first scan analyzed with a line-cross (LC) model using 124 microsatellite markers and 510 F(2) animals, 9 chromosomes were selected for genotyping of additional markers. Twenty additional markers were genotyped for 954 F(2) animals and 20 markers used in the first scan were genotyped for 444 additional F(2) animals. Three different Mendelian models using least-squares for QTL analysis were applied for the second scan: a LC model, a half-sib (HS) model, and a combined LC and HS model. Significance thresholds were determined by false discovery rate (FDR). In total, 50 QTL using the LC model, 38 QTL using the HS model, and 3 additional QTL using the combined LC and HS model were identified (qâ€‰<â€‰0.05). The LC and HS models revealed strong evidence for QTL regions on SSC6 for carcass traits (e.g., 10th-rib backfat; qâ€‰<â€‰0.0001) and on SSC15 for meat quality traits (e.g., tenderness, color, pH; qâ€‰<â€‰0.01), respectively. QTL for pH (SSC3), dressing percent (SSC7), marbling score and moisture percent (SSC12), CIE a* (SSC16), and carcass length and spareribs weight (SSC18) were also significant (qâ€‰<â€‰0.01). Additional marker and animal genotypes increased the statistical power for QTL detection, and applying different analysis models allowed confirmation of QTL and detection of new QTL.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Igseo Choi"", ids = ""48544256""); list(name = ""Juan P.

cb1be9b60f7829852a44a037bca2cb81d1c17762,PD03-10: Gene Modules and Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.,"Background: We and others have shown that high expression of proliferation and immune related genes are associated with pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer (BC). Here, we performed a meta-analysis to validate these findings and to interrogate the association between pCR and several other gene expression modules beyond standard clinico-pathological characteristics in BC subtypes. Methods: We searched for publicly available gene expression studies evaluating anthracycline Â± taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We identified 7 studies with complete genomic and clinico-pathological data including pCR totaling 788 patients. Relapse-free survival (RFS) data were available for 427 patients. We used gene expression data generated from pretreatment biopsies and computed 17 gene modules corresponding to proliferation-driven signatures, immune response, stroma activation, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss, chromosomal instability, and several other oncogenic pathways. We calculated odds ratios (OR) for pCR for one-unit increases in scaled modules, all adjusting for pretreatment clinico-pathological characteristics. Moreover, we tested for interactions between gene modules and ER or HER2 status for their association with pCR after adjusting for clinicopathological characteristics. We used the false discovery rate (FDR) to adjust for multiple testing. Results: We observed pCR in 178(22.6%) of 788 patients: 112(30.1%) of 372 with ERâˆ’/HER2âˆ’ BC, 41(36%) of 113 with HER2+ BC, and 25(8.2%) of 303 with ER+/HER2âˆ’ BC. High values of the proliferation-driven modules were associated with increased pCR rates in ERâˆ’/HER2âˆ’ (e.g. Gene70 OR=2.34, 95%CI 1.22âˆ’4.59, p=0.01, FDR=0.10) and ER+/HER2âˆ’ (e.g. Gene70 OR=3.26, CI 1.13âˆ’9.60, p=0.03, FDR=0.16), but not in the HER2+ subtype (e.g. Gene70 OR=0.82, CI 0.23âˆ’2.67, p=0.74, FDR=0.86). There was a trend for interaction between proliferation-driven modules (e.g. Gene70) and HER2 status (p=0.08, FDR=0.23). Interestingly, we demonstrated a strong association between high values of immune module and increased pCR rates in the HER2+ (OR=6.58, CI 2.20âˆ’23.40, p Conclusion: Different biological processes namely proliferation, immune response and AKT activation are associated with pCR in different BC subtypes. Our results suggest that new drugs that modulate immune responses in ERâˆ’/HER2âˆ’ and HER2+ BC and target AKT activation in HER2+ BC might be evaluated in these subtypes.

1a5633f2b789478375750eef672cf1769353d410,Bayesian multiple testing under dependence with application to functional magnetic resonance imaging,"The analysis of functional neuroimaging data often involves the simultaneous testing for activation at thousands of voxels, leading to a massive multiple testing problem. This is true whether the data analyzed are time courses observed at each voxel or a collection of summary statistics such as statistical parametric maps (SPMs). It is known that classical multiplicity corrections become strongly conservative in the presence of a massive number of tests. Some more popular approaches for thresholding imaging data, such as the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for false discovery rate control, tend to lose precision or power when the assumption of independence of the data does not hold. Bayesian approaches to large scale simultaneous inference also often rely on the assumption of independence. This dissertation introduces a spatial dependence structure into a Bayesian testing model for the analysis of SPMs. By using SPMs rather than the voxel time courses, much of the computational burden of Bayesian analysis is mitigated. Increased power is demonstrated by using the dependence model to draw inference on a real dataset collected in a fMRI study of cognitive control. The model also is shown to lead to improved identification of neural activation patterns known to be associated with eye movement tasks.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""D.

0b60a50cc57bb07fe718f76f39bc74ca79ab62aa,Expression of microRNAs and protein-coding genes associated with perineural invasion in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND
Perineural invasion (PNI) is the dominant pathway for local invasion in prostate cancer. To date, only few studies have investigated the molecular differences between prostate tumors with PNI and those without it.


METHODS
To evaluate the involvement of both microRNAs and protein-coding genes in PNI, we determined their genome-wide expression with a custom microRNA microarray and Affymetrix GeneChips in 50 prostate adenocarcinomas with PNI and 7 without it. In situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry was used to validate candidate genes.


RESULTS
Unsupervised classification of the 57 adenocarcinomas revealed two clusters of tumors with distinct global microRNA expression. One cluster contained all non-PNI tumors and a subgroup of PNI tumors. Significance analysis of microarray data yielded a list of microRNAs associated with PNI. At a false discovery rate (FDR)<10%, 19 microRNAs were higher expressed in PNI tumors than in non-PNI tumors. The most differently expressed microRNA was miR-224. ISH showed that this microRNA is expressed by perineural cancer cells. The analysis of protein-coding genes identified 34 transcripts that were differently expressed by PNI status (FDR<10%). These transcripts were down-regulated in PNI tumors. Many of those encoded metallothioneins and proteins with mitochondrial localization and involvement in cell metabolism. Consistent with the microarray data, perineural cancer cells tended to have lower metallothionein expression by immunohistochemistry than nonperineural cancer cells.


CONCLUSIONS
Although preliminary, our findings suggest that alterations in microRNA expression, mitochondrial function, and cell metabolism occur at the transition from a noninvasive prostate tumor to a tumor with PNI.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Robyn L.

ef252bd1653d61d53be712389896dad3d8c7970c,Simultaneous SNP identification and assessment of allele-specific bias from ChIP-seq data,"BackgroundSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with many aspects of human development and disease, and many non-coding SNPs associated with disease risk are presumed to affect gene regulation. We have previously shown that SNPs within transcription factor binding sites can affect transcription factor binding in an allele-specific and heritable manner. However, such analysis has relied on prior whole-genome genotypes provided by large external projects such as HapMap and the 1000 Genomes Project. This requirement limits the study of allele-specific effects of SNPs in primary patient samples from diseases of interest, where complete genotypes are not readily available.ResultsIn this study, we show that we are able to identify SNPs de novo and accurately from ChIP-seq data generated in the ENCODE Project. Our de novo identified SNPs from ChIP-seq data are highly concordant with published genotypes. Independent experimental verification of more than 100 sites estimates our false discovery rate at less than 5%. Analysis of transcription factor binding at de novo identified SNPs revealed widespread heritable allele-specific binding, confirming previous observations. SNPs identified from ChIP-seq datasets were significantly enriched for disease-associated variants, and we identified dozens of allele-specific binding events in non-coding regions that could distinguish between disease and normal haplotypes.ConclusionsOur approach combines SNP discovery, genotyping and allele-specific analysis, but is selectively focused on functional regulatory elements occupied by transcription factors or epigenetic marks, and will therefore be valuable for identifying the functional regulatory consequences of non-coding SNPs in primary disease samples.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yunyun Ni"", ids = ""2483564""); list(name = ""Amelia Weber Hall"", ids = ""16328583""); list(name = ""Anna M Battenhouse"", ids = ""5212690""); list(name = ""Vishwanath R.

c6b1f8302bb16a7fc4acee5408872da81c649df9,Liver functional genomics in beef cows on grazing systems: novel genes and pathways revealed.,"The adaptation of the liver to periods of negative energy balance is largely unknown in beef cattle on grazing systems. We evaluated liver transcriptome throughout gestation and early lactation of purebred and crossbred beef cows [Angus, Hereford, and their F1 crossbreeds (CR)], grazing high or low herbage allowances (HA) of native grasslands (4 and 2.5 kg dry matter/kg body wt annual mean; n = 16) using an Agilent 4 Ã— 44k bovine array. A total of 4,661 transcripts were affected by days [272 â‰¥ 2.5-fold difference, false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤ 0.10] and 47 pathways were altered during winter gestation (-165 to -15 days relative to calving), when cows experienced decreased body condition score, decreased insulin, and increased nonesterified fatty acid concentrations. Gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation pathways were upregulated, while cell growth, DNA replication, and transcription pathways were downregulated (FDR â‰¤ 0.25). We observed only small changes in the liver transcriptome during early lactation (+15 to +60 days). A total of 225 genes were differentially expressed (47 â‰¥ 2-fold difference, FDR â‰¤ 0.10) between HA. The majority of those were related to glucose and pyruvate metabolism and were upregulated in high HA, reflecting their better metabolic status. Two genes were upregulated in CR cows, but 148 transcripts (74 â‰¥ 2-fold change difference, FDR â‰¤ 0.10) were affected by the HA and cow genotype interaction. The transcriptional changes observed indicated a complex and previously unrecognized, hepatic adaptive program of grazing beef cows in different nutritional environments.

02e25bbe80ebb33de83e9124d0548f55603d8072,Abstract 4109: A 5-gene signature (sig) predicts clinical benefit from erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (pts) harboring wild-type (wt) EGFR & KRAS,"Background: Despite a low response rate, erlotinib (E) improves survival in a subset of NSCLC pts with wt EGFR but there are no established markers for identifying pts likely to have clinical benefit. We hypothesized that a gene expression sig could be used for this purpose. Material and Methods: We used pretreatment gene expression profiles (Affymetrix HG1.0ST) from 101 chemo-refractory pts in our Biomarkers-Integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for Lung Cancer Elimination (BATTLE) treated with E, E+bexarotene (EB), sorafenib (S), or vandetanib (V). 24 cases of wt EGFR & KRAS tumors treated with E or EB were compared to train the signature (two-sided t-test), using the primary end-point of the trial [8-week disease control (8wDC)]. Principal component (PC) analysis and a logistic regression model were used to develop the sig. Gene expression profiles from 108 NSCLC cell lines (Illumina), with available E IC50 (N=94) and DNA methylation profiling (N=66, Illumina), were used for in vitro studies. Results: 113 genes were differentially expressed between pts with or without 8wDC (false discovery rate 30%; P=0.004). Leave-one-out cross validation with various gene list lengths produced a 5-gene sig, including lipocalin 2 (LCN2), with a specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of 80% to predict 8wDC. In pts treated with E or EB, using the median sig score, the 8wDC rate in the sig-positive group was 83% compared with 0% in the sig-negative group; the sig did not predict 8wDC in pts treated with S or V (Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test P=0.023). The improvement in 8wDC in the sig-positive group translated to an increased progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio=0.12, 95% confidence interval: 0.03-0.46, P=0.001; log-rank P=0.0004; median PFS: 12.5 weeks vs. 7.2 weeks). We tested the sig in an independent set of 47 wt EGFRK the difference remained significant in wt EGFR & KRAS cell lines (P=0.014). Conclusion: We identified a 5-gene sig predictive of PFS benefit in NSCLC pts with wt EGFR & KRAS treated with E, but not S or V The sig was also predictive of E sensitivity in vitro. LCN2 was the strongest individual marker of sensitivity and may be epigenetically regulated. Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

d2ba05d23cd3d0656de4243933573666e3ee1a19,Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis Is Not Independently Associated With Neurocognitive Impairment in People Living With HIV,"Gut microbiota dysbiosis, which has been linked to many neurological diseases, is common in HIV infection. However, its role in the pathogenesis of neurocognitive impairment is still not established. In this study, a total of 85 HIV infected subjects, naÃ¯ve to antiretroviral therapy, were classified into two groups-those with HIV-associated neurological diseases (HAND) and those without, using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. Fecal samples were collected from all subjects and microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Subjects with HAND were older (P < 0.001), with lower levels of education (P = 0.002), lower CD4 T-cell counts (P = 0.032), and greater heterosexual preference (P < 0.001), than those without HAND. Gut microbiota from subjects with HAND showed significantly lower Î±-diversity compared to gut microbiota from subjects without HAND (Shannon index, P = 0.003). To exclude confounding bias, 25 subjects from each group, with comparable age, gender, CD4 T-cell count, educational level and sexual preference were further analyzed. The two groups showed comparable Î±-diversity (for SOB index, Shannon index, Simpson index, ACE index, and Chao index, all with P-value > 0.05) and Î²-diversity (ANOSIM statistic = 0.010, P = 0.231). There were no significant differences in microbiota composition between the two groups after the correction for a false discovery rate. Consistently, microbiota from the two groups presented similar predictive functional profiles.

0577fbbd1b653c2eeffa6db0c15676fd7e354329,"202 Proteomic, metabolomic and fatty acid composition in lactating and non-lactating maresâ€™ uterine fluids","In the equine industry, horse breeders aim to produce one foal per mare per year. Thus, mares are bred while nursing. In high-yielding dairy cattle, concurrent lactation and conception may affect embryo quality, but effects on uterine fluid (UF) quality are unknown. No data are available in horses. The aim of our study was to analyse the effect of nursing on protein, metabolite and fatty acid (FA) compositions of UF at ~7.5 days post-ovulation. Anglo-Arab mares (multiparous (2.7â€‰Â±â€‰0.9 foals), 10.8â€‰Â±â€‰2.5 years old) that were either nursing (N; 105â€‰Â±â€‰12 days of lactation) or barren (B) were inseminated with the semen of the same stallion at induction of ovulation with human chorionic gonadotrophin. Ovulation was confirmed by ultrasound within 48â€‰h. At 7.4â€‰Â±â€‰0.7 days post-ovulation, UF was collected with a human tampon that was left for 10â€‰min in the uterus before embryo collection. Only mares for which no embryo was collected were selected (nâ€‰=â€‰5 in both groups). Trypsin digestion followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was used for proteomic analysis, with subsequent characterisation with the PANTHER platform using an overrepresentation test (Fisher's exact type with false discovery rate correction) with the PANTHER pathway database. An untargeted approach based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was performed for metabolomics (normalisation to 50â€‰Âµg of protein), and data were analysed with the MS Peaks to Pathways tool of the MetaboAnalyst platform, using both the GSEA and mummichog algorithms (cut-offâ€‰=â€‰0.05). Fatty acid composition (% of total FA) was analysed using gas chromatography. Differences between groups were analysed using a linear model with permutation using R software with the pgirmess package (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.05 for significance). Altogether, 2706 proteins with at least two peptides were identified in maresâ€™ UF, with 164 being differentially expressed. Ubiquitin proteasome, involved in embryo-endometrium interactions, was the most enriched pathway in N mares (fold enrichmentâ€‰=â€‰15.12; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). For metabolomics, ubiquinone biosynthesis [MetaFishNet, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02; NES (Enrichment Score for the variable)/(mean of all Enrichment Score in all permutations in the dataset)â€‰=â€‰1.84] was enriched in N mares. N-Glycans, mainly guanosine diphosphate mannose (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04; NESâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’1.33) and leukotriene biosynthesis (Biocyc; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.006; NESâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’1.31), were enriched in B mares with differentially expressed leukotrienes C4/D4. The proportion of saturated FA was higher in N vs. B mares (38.4â€‰Â±â€‰3.6% vs. 33.2â€‰Â±â€‰3.6%; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03), probably due to increased palmitic (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.08) and stearic (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.08) acid proportions. In conclusion, pathways involved in uterine receptivity and inflammation seem to be enriched in B mares. Fatty acids that are readily available in the diet were more present in N mares, possibly because more elaborate FA are exported to the mammary gland for milk production. Nursing could thus modify the inflammatory response in the uterine environment at ~7.5 days post-ovulation and could affect reproductive efficiency in horses.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Emilie Derisoud"", ids = ""1405243513""); list(name = ""Anna-Katharina Hankele"", ids = ""114281355""); list(name = ""Luc Jouneau"", ids = ""1853742""); list(name = ""CÃ©dric Dubois"", ids = ""46435463""); list(name = ""Delphine Rousseau-Ralliard"", ids = ""1403435438""); list(name = ""MichÃ¨le Dahirel"", ids = ""4089936""); list(name = ""Laurence Wimel"", ids = ""47185676""); list(name = ""Susanne E Ulbrich"", ids = ""29765563""); list(name = ""Pascale Chavatte-Palmer"", ids = ""1401012245"")",,,"Reproduction, Fertility and Development",32,229-230

It aims to assess the effects of a technology family-based and PA school-based intervention. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the protocol design and the MINISALTEN intervention.MethodsThis is cluster-randomized controlled trial designed to run from July 2015 to November 2016 in 12 public schools of the city of Buenos Aires, matched for socio-demographic characteristics. The intervention is based on two main components: (a) â€œactive breaksâ€ (AB): implemented during school breaks by a PA instructor; (b) â€œvirtualâ€ (V): web-based contents delivered to the families via a multiplatform application. Using a computer generated random sequence participants are allocated to one of four intervention conditions: (AB), (V), (ABÂ +Â V), and control (C). Outcomes are measured at baseline and 12Â months post intervention, and will include data collected from the child and her/his mother/father or guardian. Primary outcome measures are: PA and sedentary behaviour (measured with accelerometers). Secondary outcome measures related are: percentage of kilocalories (kcal) from added sugars, and from total and saturated fats; grams of fruits and vegetables; and number of snacks and kcal coming from their added sugars and total and saturated fats. Family socio-economic level, home environment, and school environment will also be assessed. Statistical analysis is on an intention-to-treat principle. Baseline characteristics are described using summary measures and mixed models (with school as random effect). The effect of the two interventions will be estimated using a generalized mixed linear model with link and distribution selected according to the type of outcome. Included random effects are: child (or mother/father or guardian) accounting for repeated measures; school accounting for cluster induced by school. The most parsimonious model for each outcome will be reported. The False Discovery Rate criterion will be used to correct for multiple testing in non-planned analyses.DiscussionIt is a pioneer assessment of the impact of a technology-based virtual intervention and a school-based PA program, designed to prevent obesity, and involving the parents at public schools of Buenos Aires.Trial registrationCurrent Controlled Trials ISRCTN58093412.

In the con- text of multiple hypothesis testing, we propose a new step-wise procedure that controls the false discovery rate (FDR) and we prove it to be more powerful than any weighted Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

407f9bea86c5a48a526c25f2e01d534e222f89f9,Addressing false discoveries in network inference,"MOTIVATION
Experimentally determined gene regulatory networks can be enriched by computational inference from high-throughput expression profiles. However, the prediction of regulatory interactions is severely impaired by indirect and spurious effects, particularly for eukaryotes. Recently, published methods report improved predictions by exploiting the a priori known targets of a regulator (its local topology) in addition to expression profiles.


RESULTS
We find that methods exploiting known targets show an unexpectedly high rate of false discoveries. This leads to inflated performance estimates and the prediction of an excessive number of new interactions for regulators with many known targets. These issues are hidden from common evaluation and cross-validation setups, which is due to Simpson's paradox. We suggest a confidence score recalibration method (CoRe) that reduces the false discovery rate and enables a reliable performance estimation.


CONCLUSIONS
CoRe considerably improves the results of network inference methods that exploit known targets. Predictions then display the biological process specificity of regulators more correctly and enable the inference of accurate genome-wide regulatory networks in eukaryotes. For yeast, we propose a network with more than 22â€‰000 confident interactions. We point out that machine learning approaches outside of the area of network inference may be affected as well.

9d0f5f09263348256c5aab28fae8b4a73964727c,Proteomic analysis of human hippocampus shows differential protein expression in the different hippocampal subfields.,"In the current investigation, we aimed to characterize the differential protein expression in each of the hippocampal subregions in healthy control samples (n = 20). We used laser-assisted microdissection and difference in-gel electrophoresis to enrich for these tissues and to compare protein profiles. Image analysis was carried out using Progenesis SameSpots. Samples with a false discovery rate smaller than 5%, a p-value of < 0.01, and an expression of at least Â± 1.2 were considered significant. Proteins were identified using LC-ESI-MS/MS. The raw mass spectral data were analyzed using DataAnalysis software. Data were searched against the Swissprot database using MASCOT. Samples were grouped according to the different subregions and we found 182 spots to be differentially expressed between the different hippocampal subregions. These have been made available as part of the UCD-2DPAGE database at http://proteomics-portal.ucd.ie:8082. The associated MS data have been submitted to PRIDE (Accession numbers 21593-21745).

Deregulation of protein phosphorylation underlies the pathogenesis of many human diseases, especially cancers. Large scale phosphoproteomic analysis offer an opportunity to catalogue and understand changes in protein phosphorylation associated with cancers and thus provide new possibilities for discovering novel diagnostic biomarkers and new therapeutic targets. Although B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) represent the seventh most common cancer in western countries, the extent to which phosphoprotein deregulation may be involved in their pathogenesis is largely unknown. Here we report results of a label-free quantitative phosphoproteomics study of 3 B-cell NHL entities and investigate the contribution of one of the identified protein in the germinal center-derived NHL proliferation. Material and methods: Six milligrams of protein from 13 human B-NHL-derived cell lines (4 mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), 3 Burkitt lymphomas (BL) and 6 follicular lymphomas (FL)) digested by trypsin were subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment using metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC) and immunoprecipitation using a cocktail of 3 anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Phosphopeptides were subjected to liquid chromatography (LC) and MS/MS. Spectra were searched against the UniProtKB database using X!Tandem with k-score. Search results were then post-processed with PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet. All proteins at false discovery rate of 1% were considered for further analysis. Quantitation of identified peptides was based on spectral counts of phosphorylated peptides. Immunoprecipitation and western blot studies were performed to validate the differential phosphorylation of a subset of proteins. The functional consequences of perturbation of an outlier tyrosine phosphorylated protein (PAG1) were explored using shRNA-mediated depletion followed by both colony formation and proliferation assays with or without BCR stimulation by anti-IgM or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Results: Quantitative phosphoproteomics revealed a total of 7326 serine/threonine phosphorylatided peptides and 392 tyrosine phosphorylated peptides corresponding to 420, 290 and 356 phosphorylated proteins in BL, FL and MCL, respectively. While a subset of phosphoproteins was identified across all lymphoma entities, hierarchical clustering analysis revealed distinctive signatures for all 3 NHL subtypes. Regarding proteins identified with phosphorylated tyrosine residues, BL and FL cell lines were characterized by phosphorylation of proteins implicated in active B-cell receptor signaling such as BTK, LYN, LCK and SYK whereas MCL cell lines were characterized by phosphorylation of proteins implicated in cell cycle control such as CDK1 and CDK2. Interestingly, we identified PAG1, a negative regulator of B-cell receptor signaling, as the most highly tyrosine phosphorylated protein in the germinal center derived cell lines (BL and FL) exclusively. Differential phosphorylation of several proteins was validated by immunoprecipitation and western blot studies. PAG1 silencing in BJAB (BL cell line) by a specific PAG1 shRNA resulted in an increased propensity for colony formation when compared to a scramble shRNA. PAG1 depletion also enhanced significantly the proliferation of BJAB 48h after BCR stimulation by either anti-IgM (3.9-fold increase versus 3-fold increase, p = 0.016) or LPS (4.2-fold increase versus 3-fold increase, p = 0.015). Conclusion: Our study reveals the utility of unbiased phosphoproteome interrogation of B-NHLs to characterize signaling networks that may provide insights into the pathogenetic mechanisms. We identify more than 500 phosphorylated proteins in each NHL entity revealing distinct protein phosphorylation signatures between MCL and germinal center derived lymphomas. Activation of the BCR signaling pathway is characteristic of and pathologically relevant in germinal center derived NHLs. The results of our study reveal novel phosphorylation sites and signatures that may be exploited as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets.

Mutational signatures derive from the frequency of mutated trinucleotides in a given cancer sample, and they provide an avenue for investigating the underlying mutational processes that operate in cancer. Here we analyse somatic mutations from 7,815 cancer exomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) across 26 cancer types. We curate a list of 50 known cancer driver mutations by analysing recurrence in our cohort and annotations of known cancer-associated genes from the Cancer Gene Census, IntOGen database and Cancer Genome Interpreter. We then use these datasets to perform binary univariate logistic regression and establish the statistical relationship between individual driver mutations and known mutational signatures across different cancer types. Our analysis led to the identification of 39 significant associations between driver mutations and mutational signatures (P < 0.004, with a false discovery rate of < 5%). We first validate our methodology by establishing statistical links for known and novel associations between driver mutations and the mutational signature arising from Polymerase Epsilon proofreading deficiency. We then examine associations between driver mutations and mutational signatures for AID/APOBEC enzyme activity and deficient mismatch repair. We also identify negative associations (odds ratio < 1) between mutational signatures and driver mutations, and here we examine the role of aging and cigarette smoke mutagenesis in the generation of driver mutations in IDH1 and KRAS in brain cancers and lung adenocarcinomas respectively. Our study provides statistical foundations for hypothesised links between otherwise independent biological processes and we uncover previously unexplored relationships between driver mutations and mutagenic processes during cancer development. These associations give insights into how cancers acquire advantageous mutations and can provide direction to guide further mechanistic studies into cancer pathogenesis.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rebecca C.

37f765c22cb7534943546a99fd4ac2d90ddf0683,RpfF-dependent regulon of Xylella fastidiosa.,"ABSTRACT Xylella fastidiosa regulates traits important to both virulence of grape as well as colonization of sharpshooter vectors via its production of a fatty acid signal molecule known as DSF whose production is dependent on rpfF. Although X. fastidiosa rpfF mutants exhibit increased virulence to plants, they are unable to be spread from plant to plant by insect vectors. To gain more insight into the traits that contribute to these processes, a whole-genome Agilent DNA microarray for this species was developed and used to determine the RpfF-dependent regulon by transcriptional profiling. In total, 446 protein coding genes whose expression was significantly different between the wild type and an rpfF mutant (false discovery rate < 0.05) were identified when cells were grown in PW liquid medium. Among them, 165 genes were downregulated in the rpfF mutant compared with the wild-type strain whereas 281 genes were over-expressed. RpfF function was required for regulation of 11 regulatory and Ïƒ factors, including rpfE, yybA, PD1177, glnB, rpfG, PD0954, PD0199, PD2050, colR, rpoH, and rpoD. In general, RpfF is required for regulation of genes involved in attachment and biofilm formation, enhancing expression of hemagglutinin genes hxfA and hxfB, and suppressing most type IV pili and gum genes. A large number of other RpfF-dependent genes that might contribute to virulence or insect colonization were also identified such as those encoding hemolysin and colicin V, as well as genes with unknown functions.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Nian Wang"", ids = ""145658702""); list(name = ""Jian-Liang Li"", ids = ""8549883""); list(name = ""Steven E Lindow"", ids = ""143922796"")",dcc51a88c27d8612f9fbfe212f0c91590fc518ae; fcb8ceb393cddd95d6c4b7eae7ece3f2ba4e7bd4; b2bc28dc7a498682500659908d3e1157540d807b; 67e7c8f7ad25e570a770c36dc92c400a929450ae; 9d741f6ef16c1f24e530fe890adb176a71ac3557; 036e622e70b9950842c6949ff376c0cbe5ad9fac; fc10653d89abe232d4661a97952935d7c538d1f5; eccae7742fcb38fbac154045059f126aaef2ef90; f94c2fee215557ebd224210386e27c5dd13322aa; e128eed40f88c9a26545eec08969b3ad4b86e03f; c661dc75d966ec129da9ec38b3ae6f41522b6504; 1cf9b31fa944233acd2a5573df35ccd1bd906575; f22e6f2585afe3bbe558ddc97459341b7043c9aa; 4be8848648c3e206bbd6b31933fc2602fc5ed6fa; 27420715998741ddf5b5cdf15005a1875c8d080f; bcff73d9174a17b1c2f940b166c940ffb70a0076; 110939dc4e75bdc84bb8e692d648f9a6373b492e; c8c653d5d4cf98339ac2d7bb2aa60bfb2b96da1d; c61d4a37fa5a0d8019eaa6c69b4af67c9da7064b; 1fc16ac8e49d11ae7301668a8209cccd5bf9d24b; d5e65bba4e5d42fd000fbd187cd28db385449509; d8ef25fd6f39a0dfe9d1d28b8e802261ba1b4962,,Phytopathology,102 11,"

53f9e26a2311a633ef99b430f99a9824a8063620,Integrated Workflow for Structural Proteomics Studies Based on Cross-Linking/Mass Spectrometry with an MS/MS Cleavable Cross-Linker.,"Cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry (MS) has evolved as an alternative strategy in structural biology for characterizing three-dimensional structures of protein assemblies and for mapping protein-protein interactions. Here, we describe an integrated workflow for an automated identification of cross-linked products that is based on the use of a tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) cleavable cross-linker (containing a 1,3-bis-(4-oxo-butyl)-urea group, BuUrBu) generating characteristic doublet patterns upon fragmentation. We evaluate different fragmentation methods available on an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer for three proteins and an E.Â coli cell lysate. An updated version of the dedicated software tool MeroX was employed for a fully automated identification of cross-links. The strength of our cleavable cross-linker is that characteristic patterns of the cross-linker as well as backbone fragments of the connected peptides are already observed at the MS/MS level, eliminating the need for conducting MS(3) or sequential CID (collision-induced dissociation)- and ETD (electron transfer dissociation)-MS/MS experiments. This makes our strategy applicable to a broad range of mass spectrometers with MS/MS capabilities. For purified proteins and protein complexes, our workflow using CID-MS/MS acquisition performs with high confidence, scoring cross-links at 0.5% false discovery rate (FDR). The cross-links provide structural insights into the intrinsically disordered tetrameric tumor suppressor protein p53. As a time-consuming manual inspection of cross-linking data is not required, our workflow will pave the way for making the cross-linking/MS approach a routine technique for structural proteomics studies.",2016,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christian Arlt"", ids = ""8728563""); list(name = ""Michael GÃ¶tze"", ids = ""3032678""); list(name = ""Christian H.

765ca16898bc8f885d853ded4edfdd5b869eae53,Strategies for the Design and Analysis of Introgression Libraries and Near-Isogenic Lines,"Near-isogenic line (NIL) libraries can be used to detect benefi cial trait variation in germplasm that is unadapted or has poor agronomic performance. The objectives of our study were to compare the t test, Dunnett test, and linear model test with regard to the power and false positive rate of quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection in NIL libraries of different design. We employed computer simulations with maize genome models to investigate nonoverlapping NIL libraries, overlapping NIL libraries, and stepped aligned inbred recombinant strains (STAIRS) libraries for traits with oligogenic inheritance. Quantitative trait loci detection power of the linear model and Dunnett tests were similar for nonoverlapping and STAIRS libraries; for overlapping NIL libraries the Dunnett test was slightly superior. False positives were greatest for the t test and lowest for the linear model test. False positive sums with the Dunnett test were generally higher than for the linear model test if the heritability was 0.9 or lower. We conclude that the linear model test is superior to the Dunnett test for nonoverlapping NIL libraries and for overlapping NIL libraries with heritabilities below 0.9, as usually occur. Analysis of a rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) library revealed two other major advantages of the linear model test. First, detection of positive and negative QTL effects present in the same line is possible. Second, for NILs with multiple donor segments, observed phenotypic differences can be assigned to individual chromosome segments. G.S. Mahone and M.

97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac,Controlling the false discovery rate via knockoffs,"In many fields of science, we observe a response variable together with a large number of potential explanatory variables, and would like to be able to discover which variables are truly associated with the response. At the same time, we need to know that the false discovery rate (FDR) - the expected fraction of false discoveries among all discoveries - is not too high, in order to assure the scientist that most of the discoveries are indeed true and replicable. This paper introduces the knockoff filter, a new variable selection procedure controlling the FDR in the statistical linear model whenever there are at least as many observations as variables. This method achieves exact FDR control in finite sample settings no matter the design or covariates, the number of variables in the model, or the amplitudes of the unknown regression coefficients, and does not require any knowledge of the noise level. As the name suggests, the method operates by manufacturing knockoff variables that are cheap - their construction does not require any new data - and are designed to mimic the correlation structure found within the existing variables, in a way that allows for accurate FDR control, beyond what is possible with permutation-based methods. The method of knockoffs is very general and flexible, and can work with a broad class of test statistics. We test the method in combination with statistics from the Lasso for sparse regression, and obtain empirical results showing that the resulting method has far more power than existing selection rules when the proportion of null variables is high.",2015,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Rina Foygel Barber"", ids = ""32492090""); list(name = ""Emmanuel J.

ca766bbfc70f2f4c9873bc336f4546ad47114070,Comparison of association methods for dense marker data.,"While data sets based on dense genome scans are becoming increasingly common, there are many theoretical questions that remain unanswered. How can a large number of markers in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) and rare disease variants be simulated efficiently? How should markers in high LD be analyzed: individually or jointly? Are there fast and simple methods to adjust for correlation of tests? What is the power penalty for conservative Bonferroni adjustments? Assuming that association scans are adequately powered, we attempt to answer these questions. Performance of single-point and multipoint tests, and their hybrids, is investigated using two simulation designs. The first simulation design uses theoretically derived LD patterns. The second design uses LD patterns based on real data. For the theoretical simulations we used polychoric correlation as a measure of LD to facilitate simulation of markers in LD and rare disease variants. Based on the simulation results of the two studies, we conclude that statistical tests assuming only additive genotype effects (i.e. Armitage and especially multipoint T(2)) should be used cautiously due to their suboptimal power in certain settings. A false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted combination of tests for additive, dominant and recessive effects had close to optimal power. However, the common genotypic chi(2) test performed adequately and could be used in lieu of the FDR combination. While some hybrid methods yield (sometimes spectacularly) higher power they are computationally intensive. We also propose an ""exact"" method to adjust for multiple testing, which yields nominally higher power than the Bonferroni correction.",2008,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""S A Bacanu"", ids = ""89771785""); list(name = ""Matthew R.

47fc5b567bf4c676d49b32de11b1dafe42f57f35,CCSI: a database providing chromatinâ€“chromatin spatial interaction information,"Distal regulatory elements have been shown to regulate gene transcription through spatial interactions, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are linked with distal gene expression by spatial proximity, which helps to explain the causal role of disease-associated SNPs in non-coding region. Therefore, studies on spatial interactions between chromatin have created a new avenue for elucidating the mechanism of transcriptional regulation in disease pathogenesis. Recently, a growing number of chromatin interactions have been revealed by means of 3C, 4C, 5C, ChIA-PET and Hi-C technologies. To interpret and utilize these interactions, we constructed chromatin-chromatin spatial interaction (CCSI) database by integrating and annotating 91 sets of chromatin interaction data derived from published literature, UCSC database and NCBI GEO database, resulting in a total of 3,017,962 pairwise interactions (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05), covering human, mouse and yeast. A web interface has been designed to provide access to the chromatin interactions. The main features of CCSI are (i) showing chromatin interactions and corresponding genes, enhancers and SNPs within the regions in the search page; (ii) offering complete interaction datasets, enhancer and SNP information in the download page; and (iii) providing analysis pipeline for the annotation of interaction data. In conclusion, CCSI will facilitate exploring transcriptional regulatory mechanism in disease pathogenesis associated with spatial interactions among genes, regulatory regions and SNPs.

b2fbad41347e44451c0eff07cd580f18e17e242c,Splice junction centric approach to identify translated noncanonical isoforms in the human proteome,"RNA sequencing has led to the discovery of many transcript isoforms created by alternative splicing, but the translational status and functional significance of most alternative splicing events remain unknown. Here we applied a splice junction-centric approach to survey the landscape of protein alternative isoform expression in the human proteome. We focused on alternative splice events where pairs of splice junctions corresponding to included and excluded exons with appreciable read counts are translated together into selective protein sequence databases. Using this approach, we constructed tissue-specific FASTA databases from ENCODE RNA sequencing data, then reanalyzed splice junction peptides in existing mass spectrometry datasets across 10 human tissues (heart, lung, liver, pancreas, ovary, testis, colon, prostate, adrenal gland, and esophagus). Our analysis reidentified 1,108 non-canonical isoforms annotated in SwissProt. We further found 253 novel splice junction peptides in 212 genes that are not documented in the comprehensive Uniprot TrEMBL or Ensembl RefSeq databases. On a proteome scale, non-canonical isoforms differ from canonical sequences preferentially at sequences with heightened protein disorder, suggesting a functional consequence of alternative splicing on the proteome is the regulation of intrinsically disordered regions. We further observed examples where isoform-specific regions intersect with important cardiac protein phosphorylation sites.

6f04be1393ee95018a677ff3f9d1e7e2a44ed8b9,188 Effects of in Vitro Maturation on Gene Expression in Rhesus Monkey Oocytes,"Assisted reproduction technologies (ARTs) are achieving increasing prominence in reproductive medicine. With the increasing application of ARTs comes increased interest in optimizing efficiency while minimizing potential risks to the offspring. One area of assisted reproduction in which improvements are being sought is in vitro oocyte maturation. In vitro oocyte maturation (IVM) holds great promise as a tool for enhancing clinical treatment of infertility, enhancing availability of non-human primates for development of disease models, and facilitating endangered species preservation. However, IVM outcomes have remained significantly below success rates obtained using in vivo-matured (VVM) oocytes from humans and non-human primates. There is thus considerable interest in improving IVM. Key objectives toward achieving more efficient IVM will be to establish the molecular determinants of oocyte quality, identify specific biological processes or mechanisms that may be disrupted by ARTs, and identify specific modifications to procedures to eliminate these deficiencies. This study provides the first global comparison of mRNA expression profiles between in vitro- and in vivo-matured metaphase II stage oocytes in a non-human primate species. RNAs isolated from oocytes of each kind (IVM and VVM) were subjected to a 2-cycle labeling assay, and the labeled cRNAs were hybridized to Affymetrix rhesus macaque genome arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). To minimize false positive signals, only genes called present in at least 3 out of 4 biological replicates were used for significance analysis of microarray. Genes with significant differences among samples were identified at the 5% false discovery rate and were further selected on the basis of t-test (P < 0.05). We observed a small set of just 59 mRNAs that are differentially expressed between the 2 types of oocytes. Independent confirmation of gene expression differences was performed for 19 candidate genes using the quantitative RT-PCR. Gene functional classification analysis revealed that genes differentially expressed between IVM and VVM oocytes are related to cellular homeostasis, cell-cell interactions including growth factor and hormone stimulation and cell adhesion, and other functions such as mRNA stability and translation. Additionally, we observed in IVM oocytes overexpression of PLAGL1 and MEST, 2 maternally imprinted genes, indicating a possible interruption or loss of correct epigenetic programming. These results provide novel insight into the nature of oocyte-follicle cell interactions, the potential molecular and cellular consequences of altering these interactions, and the basis for compromised developmental competence following IVM procedures in a non-human primate model. The results also raise concerns about applying IVM clinically without addressing such developmental defects but indicate that these deficiencies may be overcome by further improvement in IVM culture systems.

b9e7b1ac5dc67fce735360cc4d72e1832c731e7e,A MEIS1 Dependent Genetic Program in Leukemia Associated with Cell Cycle Entry and â€˜Stemnessâ€™,"The HOX co-factor MEIS1 is expressed in several leukemias, especially those involving MLL-gene rearrangements. Experimental data have demonstrated that MLL-fusion proteins induce the expression of MEIS1 in hematopoietic cells along with increased self-renewal and recent murine experiments indicate that MEIS1 is central to the growth-promoting effects of MLL fusion proteins. However, the cellular and molecular pathways that are regulated by MEIS1 are unknown. We studied the effect of MEIS1 knock-down in a cell line derived from a leukemic MLL-AF9 knock-in mouse. Transduction of this cell line (4166) with MEIS1-shRNA bearing lentivirus led to significant reduction in MEIS1 expression compared to cells transduced with control virus. The MEIS1 knock-down cells displayed decreased cell cycle entry, while terminal myeloid differentiation and apoptosis were enhanced. To characterize the molecular effects of MEIS1 knock-down, we performed gene expression profiling of leukemia cells with and without MEIS1 expression. We extracted RNA from 5 separate experiments where 4166 cells were transduced with vector control or MEIS1 shRNA for 48 hours and analyzed gene expression profiles using Affymetrix 430 2.0 whole genome arrays. We used a regularized two-sample paired t-test to select genes that were differentially expressed among the two groups. At a false discovery rate (FDR) of â‰¤ 5%, 1053 probe sets displayed decreased expression with MEIS1 knockdown, while 296 probe sets showed increased expression. Analysis of gene ontology (GO) terms by DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) revealed that the list of genes down-regulated with MEIS1 knock-down was significantly enriched in genes associated with the cell cycle and its regulation (Cdk2, Cdk6, Cdkn3, Ccna2, Cdc7, Cdc42, Rbl1, Wee1) and DNA replication (Brca1, Cdc6, Cdt1, Gmnn, Mcm4, Mcm5, Mcm8). Conversely, the genes displaying increased expression with MEIS1 knockdown were associated with inhibition of proliferation eg. Cdkn1a (p21), Btg2, Btg3 and pro-apoptotic effects such as Bax. A search of the Molecular Signatures Database for previously published profiles that overlap with our list of MEIS1-dependent genes revealed that the profile of MEIS1 knockdown in our murine leukemia cells significantly overlapped with that of neural stem cells. Specifically, of the 1838 genes expressed highly in neural stem cells compared to differentiated brain and bone marrow cells (Ramalho-Santos et al, Science 2002), 155 showed an overlap with the 594 genes in our MEIS1-dependent set (594 gene identifiers contained in 1053 probe sets; p = 3.27 eâˆ’28, hypergeometric distribution). This list of 155 genes included MEIS1 and several of the cell cycle and DNA replication-associated genes. These results reveal a core self-renewal genetic program shared by leukemia and neural stem cells that is regulated by MEIS1. Activation of MEIS1 in leukemia and possibly brain tumors could thus enhance self-renewal via the up-regulation of the above common genes. Overall, our results show that MEIS1 regulates cell cycle entry in murine MLL-AF9 leukemia, an effect that enhances self-renewal in other cells as well.",2008,Biology,"list(name = ""Ashish Kumar"", ids = ""40080943""); list(name = ""Baolin Wu"", ids = ""49814547""); list(name = ""John H.

ab3d5dcb0600d0b9f77100a956c3e5fb40de11f8,Postural imbalance and falls in PSP correlate with functional pathology of the thalamus,"Objective: To determine how postural imbalance and falls are related to regional cerebral glucose metabolism (PET) and functional activation of the cerebral postural network (fMRI) in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Methods: Sixteen patients with PSP, who had self-monitored their frequency of falls, underwent a standardized clinical assessment, posturographic measurement of balance during modified sensory input, and a resting [18F]FDG-PET. In addition, patients performed an fMRI paradigm using mental imagery of standing. Results were compared to healthy controls (n = 16). Results: The frequency of falls/month in patients (range 1â€“40) correlated with total PSP rating score (r = 0.90). Total sway path in PSP significantly correlated with frequency of falls, especially during modulated sensory input (eyes open: r = 0.62, eyes closed: r = 0.67, eyes open/head extended: r = 0.84, eyes open/foam-padded platform: r = 0.87). Higher sway path values and frequency of falls were associated with decreased regional glucose metabolism (rCGM) in the thalamus (sway path: r = âˆ’0.80, falls: r = âˆ’0.64) and increased rCGM in the precentral gyrus (sway path: r = 0.79, falls: r = 0.64). Mental imagery of standing during fMRI revealed a reduced activation of the mesencephalic brainstem tegmentum and the thalamus in patients with postural imbalance and falls. Conclusions: The new and clinically relevant finding of this study is that imbalance and falls in PSP are closely associated with thalamic dysfunction. Deficits in thalamic postural control get most evident when balance is assessed during modified sensory input. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that reduced thalamic activation via the ascending brainstem projections may cause postural imbalance in PSP.

e08e3159d2379ebe0ac3e1b39ae258c12fd9e929,[Research on the association between U2-dependent spliceosome gene and hepatocellular cancer].,"OBJECTIVE
To determine the association between U2-dependent spliceosome related 8 key genes and hepatocellular cancer (HCC).


METHODS
A two-stage case-control study was conducted. Twenty-two candidate tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) were genotyped by TaqMan Openarray assay in a screened population that living in Central China (378 HCC incident cases and 461 controls). Frequencies of 4 SNPs (rs2074733, rs9608886, rs7288947 and rs5994293) showed significant difference between cases and controls in the screened population and then genotyped by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction in the validation Chinese Han population from Beijing (428 cases and 647 controls).


RESULTS
The rs5994293 in SF3A1 gene showed a significant association with HCC in both screened population and combined population. Subjects with G allele had a lower risk of HCC, compared to those with the TT genotype. OR appeared to be 0.70 (95% CI: 0.58-0.84, false discovery rate adjusted P = 0.000 5) for the combined population. An additive interaction between smoking, drinking alcohol and rs5994293 TT was observed in HBsAg negative subjects of the combined populations.


CONCLUSION
Our results showed an association existing between SF3A1 rs5994293 and HCC. These findings should be confirmed by further independently large-scale population studies and functional analysis.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Song"", ids = ""145273607""); list(name = ""Beibei Zhu"", ids = ""145801438""); list(name = ""Yao Tian"", ids = ""15322072""); list(name = ""Rong Zhong"", ids = ""144390571""); list(name = ""Jing Tian"", ids = ""145928766""); list(name = ""Xiaoping Miao"", ids = ""144683184""); list(name = ""Li Wang"", ids = ""46659472"")",,,Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,36 6,"

Drug makers are increasingly interested in using adaptive design trials to improve and accelerate clinical development. We have seen a broad expansion in innovative clinical trial designs and analysis methods, in particular within the last 7 years since the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released the draft guidance titled â€œGuidance for Industry on Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologicsâ€ [1]. In this special issue, we include articles presenting further developments in statistical methodology underlying the design and analysis of modern clinical trials. A main area of methodological development for clinical trial in the past decade has been the advancement in adaptive designs, including, but not limited to, group sequential designs, sample size re-estimation (SSR), seamless Phase II/III designs, adaptive dose-finding, and biomarker-adaptive designs. Modern developments in statistical methodology, both frequentist and Bayesian, can be flexibly incorporated in such adaptive designs, as proposed and studied in the articles in this issue, applicable to both exploratory and confirmatory clinical trials. In the age of personalized medicine, one research area of particular interest is biomarker-guided disease risk prediction and drug development. A number of design and analysis methods are proposed in the present issue for testing a biomarkerâ€™s clinical utility, identifying the suitable target populations (overall or biomarker positive) in clinical trials, and determining a biomarker guided treatment strategy. Statistical issues include the interaction test to identify predictive biomarkers, subgroup analysis, power evaluation, multiple testing and false discovery rate (FDR), among others. Along with the methodological and design articles published in regular issues of Contemporary Clinical Trials, we strive to provide researchers and practitioners with a variety of tools for innovative, efficient trial design and implementation. We hope as we continue to develop, promote, and learn the proper usage of innovative trial designs and analysis methods, collectively we will gain more knowledge and improve the efficiency of clinical development.",2017,Medicine,,,,Contemporary clinical trials,63,"

With increasing evidences from parallel studies in our laboratory about the possible role of Wdr13 in stress response, we investigated its role in brain. We observed that Wdr13 transcript gets up-regulated in the hippocampus of the wild-type mice exposed to stress. To further dissect its function, we analyzed the behavioral and molecular phenotypes of Wdr13-/0 mice when subjected to mild chronic psychological stress, namely; mild (attenuated) social isolation. We employed iTRAQ based quantitative proteomics, real time PCR and western blotting to investigate molecular changes. Three weeks of social isolation predisposed Wdr13-/0 mice to anhedonia, heightened anxiety-measured by Open field test (OFT), increased behavior despair- measured by Forced swim test (FST) and reduced dendritic branching along with decreased spine density of hippocampal CA1 neurons as compared to wild-type counterparts. This depression-like-phenotype was however ameliorated when treated with anti-depressant imipramine. Molecular analysis revealed that out of 1002 quantified proteins [1% False discovery rate (FDR), at-least two unique peptides], strikingly, a significant proportion of synaptic proteins including, SYN1, CAMK2A, and RAB3A were down-regulated in the socially isolated Wdr13-/0 mice as compared to its wild-type counterparts. This was in contrast to the elevated levels of these proteins in non-stressed mutants as compared to the controls. We hypothesized that a de-regulated transcription factor upstream of the synaptic genes might be responsible for the observed phenotype. Indeed, in the socially isolated Wdr13-/0 mice, there was an up-regulation of GATA1 - a transcription factor that negatively regulates synaptic genes and has been associated with Major Depression (MD) in humans. The present study demonstrates significant genotype Ã— enviornment interaction for Wdr13 gene as shown by the reversal in the expression levels of several synaptic proteins in the mutant vis-Ã -vis wild-type mouse when exposed to social isolation stress.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shiladitya Mitra"", ids = ""50298768""); list(name = ""Ghantasala S.

They might potentially have a shared genetic basis. By incorporating information about these pleiotropic effects, we may be able to explore more of the traitsâ€™ total heritability. We applied a recently developed conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method to the summary statistics from two independent GWASs to identify the potential pleiotropic genetic variants for BMD and BC. By jointly analyzing two large independent GWASs of BMD and BC, we found strong pleiotropic enrichment between them and identified 102 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BMD and 192 SNPs in BC with cFDRÂ <Â 0.05, including 230 SNPs that might have been overlooked by the standard GWAS analysis. cFDR-significant genes were enriched in GO terms and KEGG pathways which were crucial to bone metabolism and/or BC pathology (adjPÂ <Â 0.05). Some cFDR-significant genes were partially validated in the gene expressional validation assay. Strong interactions were found between proteins produced by cFDR-significant genes in the context of biological mechanism of bone metabolism and/or BC etiology. Totally, we identified 7 pleiotropic SNPs that were associated with both BMD and BC (conjunction cFDRÂ <Â 0.05); CCDC170, ESR1, RANKL, CPED1, and MEOX1 might play important roles in the pleiotropy of BMD and BC.

1766edbe6b4afc5418c934a27bf0bea3ec52cfa8,IDDF2018-ABS-0104â€…Molecular insights into colon mucinous adenocarcinoma,"Background Mucinous adenocarcinoma (MAC) is a histological subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC), in which account for 5%â€“15% of all primary CRC. MAC is characterised by the formation of a tumour comprised of >50%â€‰mucin. The prognostic value of MAC remains controversial; several studies report that MAC has a worse prognosis than nonmucinous adenocarcinoma (non-MAC), while others are not. Thus, it is important to decipher the molecular signature of MAC to better understand the unfamiliar subtype of the disease and improve the individualised management of patients with MAC. Methods Here, we comprehensively characterised the somatic mutation, genome-wide transcriptional (mRNA and miRNA), and epigenetic (DNA methylation) profiles of the MAC, combined with correlative analyses of expression, methylation, and clinical data from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Differentially expressed gene (DEGs, false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P-value<0.05â€‰and fold change >2 ) analysis between MAC and non-MAC was performed by DEGSeq package for R/Bioconductor. Significantly differentially methylated site (DMS, FDR adjusted P-value<1E-5 and beta value change >0.2) was performed by limma package for R/Bioconductor. Results Results showed that MAC harbours 3366 frequent mutational gene sets (FMGSs, apriori method), in sharp contrast to only 94 in non-MAC. Three-fold higher BRAF mutation rate in MAC than non-MAC was observed, and this may account for a worse prognosis in MAC. Notably, we found ATM had the same high mutation rate as TP53 in MAC, thus rescue of ATM was rather important because ATM acts upstream of TP53. In addition, hundreds of DEGs such as AQP3, MUC2, and FCGBP and 4 differentially expressed miRNAs were determined between MAC and non-MAC. Additionally, 1,926 DMSs that were associated with inflammatory response, cell adhesion, neutrophil chemotaxis, and immune response were identified as well. Conclusions The huge molecular difference exists between MAC and non-MAC inspires us treating CRC in a more careful manner because we are driving toward a new era of precision medicine. In other words, the medical decision making used in MAC cannot simply copy from strategy adopted in non-MAC.",2018,,"list(name = ""Yanmei Yang"", ids = ""49308310"")",,,Gut,67,A4
7c4723c4def181567b07631829e060a71d4c63bb,Probabilities of spurious connections in gene networks: application to expression time series,"MOTIVATION
The reconstruction of gene networks from gene-expression microarrays is gaining popularity as methods improve and as more data become available. The reliability of such networks could be judged by the probability that a connection between genes is spurious, resulting from chance fluctuations rather than from a true biological relationship.


RESULTS
Unlike the false discovery rate and positive false discovery rate, the decisive false discovery rate (dFDR) is exactly equal to a conditional probability without assuming independence or the randomness of hypothesis truth values. This property is useful not only in the common application to the detection of differential gene expression, but also in determining the probability of a spurious connection in a reconstructed gene network. Estimators of the dFDR can estimate each of three probabilities: (1) The probability that two genes that appear to be associated with each other lack such association. (2) The probability that a time ordering observed for two associated genes is misleading.

5de040d5cc8441d05fafa83ed2048c657abc00fd,Post-Acute Cortical Thickness in Children with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury versus Orthopedic Injury.,"Studies of brain morphometry may illuminate the effects of pediatric mild traumatic brain injury (TBI; e.g., concussion). However, no published studies have examined cortical thickness in the early injury phases of pediatric mild TBI using an appropriate comparison group. The current study used an automated approach (i.e., Freesurfer) to determine whether cortical thickness differed in children following a mild TBI or a mild orthopedic injury (OI), and to examine whether post-acute cortical thickness predicted with post-acute and chronic post-concussive symptoms (PCS). Children aged 8-16.99 years with mild TBI (n=136) or OI (n=70) were recruited at emergency department visits to two children's hospitals, during which parents rated children's pre-injury symptoms retrospectively. Children completed a post-acute (<2 weeks post-injury) assessment, which included a 3T MRI, and 3- and 6-month post-injury assessments. Parents and children rated PCS at each assessment. Cortical thickness was estimated using FreeSurfer. Linear mixed effects and multivariable negative binomial regression models were used to test study aims, with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons. Groups differed significantly on left parietal cortical thickness (TBI>OI) after FDR correction. Cortical thickness also varied by brain subregion and age, but not sex. Groups differed significantly on PCS post-acutely (TBI>OI), but not at 3 or 6 months. Right frontal thickness was positively related to post-acute PCS in both groups. Right cingulum thickness predicted chronic PCS in the OI group only. Results highlight the complexity of predicting outcomes of pediatric mild TBI from post-acute neuroimaging biomarkers.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ashley L Ware"", ids = ""38865324""); list(name = ""Naomi J Goodrich-Hunsaker"", ids = ""1397972951""); list(name = ""Catherine Lebel"", ids = ""2058576""); list(name = ""Ayushi Shukla"", ids = ""1567622095""); list(name = ""Elisabeth A.

77e04ef625ccd277cb55d5a431139573304e491a,Integrative Functional Network Interactions Underlie the Association between Physical Activity and Cognition in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Physical activity (PA) has preventive and possibly restorative effects in aging-related cognitive decline, which relate to intrinsic functional interactions (functional connectivity, FC) in large-scale brain networks. Preventive and ameliorative effects of PA on cognitive decline have also been documented in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). However, the neural substrates that mediate the association between PA and cognitive performance under such neurological conditions remain unknown. Here we set out to examine if the association between PA and cognitive performance in PD is mediated by FC in large-scale sensorimotor and association brain networks. Data from 51 PD patients were analyzed. Connectome-level analysis based on a whole-brain parcellation showed that self-reported levels of PA were associated with increased FC between, but not within the default mode (DMN) and salience networks (SAL) (p < .05, false discovery rate corrected). Additionally, multiple parallel mediation analysis further demonstrated that FC between left lateral parietal nodes in the DMN and rostral prefrontal nodes in the SAL mediated the association between PA and executive function performance. These findings are in line with previous studies linking FC in large-scale association networks with the effects of PA on cognition in healthy aging. Our results extend these previous results by demonstrating that the association between PA and cognitive performance in neurodegenerative diseases such as PD is mediated by integrative functional interactions in large-scale association networks.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Chia-Hao Shih"", ids = ""4838080""); list(name = ""Miriam Sklerov"", ids = ""50637469""); list(name = ""Nina Browner"", ids = ""49847211""); list(name = ""Eran Dayan"", ids = ""2156490"")",,07a6112414db5983f5b6c1d9b7feb733b390fdd7; a9e0587050952d1d4288acc41b614f58dc463b58; 019989eca0033cc931a5bdc46bf2dd98deb4228c; 5711b7969879c041ca771a7b8fdbdb2a7f8fbeac; 6c64889a707a15702f0abb047be5cd14d8a3dfb4; a4d6cec439d2f8dde4710feac88c863829b12063; 0ad7c9ae86d5fc4d8fbd3a17483de80bee2898fc; d431ec4483c56795e5ce896a6506aa59772e21d6; 0e38f8c47371d834b7efe754509f55158c6dc263; f77983b2d20819a60897cd7445ca3f921569ddca; 88147fecb3bea806b920f7cd14d438fb5f08c59b; 9b691a785dfaa480ca4baa3958236a6c8edc44c8; b06bf1e8b36ef032731a2607471bba7797482c07; 051095fa465b3c9371409809e6e65d265ae42cad; 65e3cf84f4ba10ca7a0c2216a3802c8e349653be; f701cbde6d3dcc6b6fd8ab2ef33ec46369bcb945; a0a8bb1034e79340dee2c69d2a6dfb5c0ce403fd; edaf1fdc6c3f40d66a7bbe85c07df204c1a8b7a3; ca8fba7e7b289f1d36d1f3f708f5f1cc2c5f9c71; 721c1c832653b1cf679b9ed4a0c953de4fe8807f; cf4cb3dbc3cca01a4540245760b36557164cba4e; f2b643196d6b6add22d217927ba617795400a2c2; 27f737c4333003591dfe3f4ca41358f72130a2ec; 2f6960ab521e3303a7595c2d12fa5e521373fb8e; d58e4075a79fc02531488e8b3a28bf3233af5c97; 76c863e0f6460fc524d0c5c546f9cdd6286bd2e0; 1f0582cb0230672c039d03e1008f2cf2f03a1523; efd8772c3d5581e9a9553c2932f2b502e5fe1d42; 927de1d376eb95566128eecf521840fb94dea059; 0c10b5abb4988fd5cdf11d59210926a3322a36bb; ed8b632290736d8b0868f1a6279e642740676ff4; 0316f2bc77021bcf6499374213ffec0a95926dd9; 895820da31d7312843042ac6cb83b5111eb09fae; 84d5f00e4d27d8d405d365a7b6f791ddbc5e0465; 97d0d3aeabc0e54ab4c320c2c0c24cd950142e64; 2b02e478898e1e27ebca62214d71a6ccbacf78ea; ea984a3a4a279d1a2b782ff3b40b801164c7a5e1; ad3b6115f089f0dc81f9fae275ded58bf70f091a; ee8685662a884632cbded049051bda8803f82cb5; 0abff6b9d876672207bd4501c5767d0471d7b15b; c5e55eaf0f3d40b568c72c01cb0cf9ae8142acb1; 0b55af3e802564aea51cceeae64a41ec381c6bc5; a6afaafcb8566dd27e256ed2ca84eaa336b9d03f; a630ed84db93295534632c89eeb1ed8387540871; be72c2d134313c67a9c84b2a2bc0b987976accbd; 1b90ab2d2177af29fd3066c857f74f79f32c8f0b; 070ec1baa4d74fe63b7c6c450487e851e2523a36; a7a967faf609ad8169b0669cb9d73ca328a83f17; 2155fbb17cad3ffdd53fa948a786e4b24d818843; 70ebae0484b27bc392f2fcd9ab59d323db4fe598; 8ec81329fe0a0f4896aff94dd05fd4443da3b62c; 8c28caad5c4286e4cde8a73703ad5bc00c199d84; c17b1e8b3bfea4cfaa1414a853d31b9d3e50c6fc; 83baae8c8e08542425bd1c7d8c88ddcd7da2381f; 0011f022a6fb534a7829e104b9860ca5423ae920; 6ba329a13b53dad306820e73cf368796a0961daa; be94458cc6db0198864a150e5d6c6fc496c1bc22; d59078affed8548afe9b9e71c85707be2494666f; 89f679048bb0c3c57203af46eb9770ae773d754d; a56d00a99a50edbf7940871950ec6973299cee08; fba8fe36475509612cd829a253a276e5166ff42a; 43105f4d6a1514e67dc837cde2ebfa8ed5de0634; c1bb9e5e9c34fc42c66382fb0215a2ee0d588201; e2ff061465daecbe0572c6d00bd56c6ef2a46fbb; 118d5aa95877702d313a6c243a0e0399bd4f4cda; d47b3065a6c769c59cfdd3a1abde0e1ec3c9a971; d285fecbc13b3623630f78473729fdb4637ef738; cca9b965c91bccb54959abdf84feb38e97777aa2; 6e68281b6e24357186f37a065375c6cad4f186f0; 2d8f7fdb1698e642f375c876181cbfee96ed45e8; 3b4178a2eadbc8d84b82106bcfa386af45d61700; 562ea12f1d41b27aba3ab3788fa778cd0d55e7f0; 0fc4a06bbea1698236684042fe261d65ff80198a; 9a3a0e313285527f8415e43935c0153f7e42d0b0; 266b6be3ac5822afcb67b0e281110490305d0af9; 13bfdf45f347869eaeab73b80902a0c41f5913c2; bc5d3edb1b8aba7f95419888d40bd6e269a37e6b; 0de2151895c2506a651781eb1a9fc186e4cc8eb2; 7ea9f594f2c660dec86ee8e42c8245a6add5b7b1; 034131d78144cbef7f55e3fbb5ce1a24ad163846; c5bd12811ec98818f45aafc131ffa45859c11d15; 7c00a4475ff6f32169da321c611a2011e0554d5f,bioRxiv,,
1610a47dace32a577d0cbe177833c9f27f062b2e,Docking features for predicting binding loss due to protein mutation,"The human genome contains a large number of protein polymorphisms due to individual genome variation. How many of these polymorphisms lead to altered protein-protein interaction is unknown. We have developed a method that uses docking simulations to predict whether variants have altered interactions with their binding partners. A novel docking score normalization that compares the docking of mutant-containing protein pairs to that of the wild-type pair is introduced. Using the SKEMPI database and CAPRI, a training set of 167 mutant pairs (87 binders, 80 non-binders) were identified and docked using the docking program, HADDOCK. A random forest classifier that uses the differences in resulting docking scores for the 167 mutant pairs, to distinguish between variants that have either completely or partially lost binding ability, was used. 50% of non-binders were correctly predicted with a false discovery rate of only 2%. This allows for the rapid identification of a large number of protein polymorphisms that are likely to have a physiological consequence.

d63957581cee8f985cc06415f0db3b65ea94ea90,Fast Open Modification Spectral Library Searching through Approximate Nearest Neighbor Indexing.,"Open modification searching (OMS) is a powerful search strategy that identifies peptides carrying any type of modification by allowing a modified spectrum to match against its unmodified variant by using a very wide precursor mass window. A drawback of this strategy, however, is that it leads to a large increase in search time. Although performing an open search can be done using existing spectral library search engines by simply setting a wide precursor mass window, none of these tools have been optimized for OMS, leading to excessive runtimes and suboptimal identification results. We present the ANN-SoLo tool for fast and accurate open spectral library searching. ANN-SoLo uses approximate nearest neighbor indexing to speed up OMS by selecting only a limited number of the most relevant library spectra to compare to an unknown query spectrum. This approach is combined with a cascade search strategy to maximize the number of identified unmodified and modified spectra while strictly controlling the false discovery rate as well as a shifted dot product score to sensitively match modified spectra to their unmodified counterparts. ANN-SoLo achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of speed and the number of identifications. On a previously published human cell line data set, ANN-SoLo confidently identifies more spectra than SpectraST or MSFragger and achieves a speedup of an order of magnitude compared with SpectraST. ANN-SoLo is implemented in Python and C++.

Using a DNA microarray technology we investigated the early gene expression profile of human vascular endothelium conditioned by DHA under pro-inflammatory conditions.

Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with 50 Î¼mol/L DHA for 48 hours and then stimulated with 5 ng/mL IL-1Î² for 3 hours. Total RNA was extracted, and qualitatively/quantitatively analyzed with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an Agilent Bioanalyzer before RNA labeling and purification. Gene expression profile was performed with an Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray covering 41 000 unique genes and transcripts. Slides were scanned with the Agilent's scanner and images processed using Agilent Feature Extraction software. The raw data were further processed with the GeneSpringÂ® 10 software and differentially expressed RNA identified using Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate with a P-value <0.05. Functional and network analyses were identified by the Ingenuity Pathways version 8.0 Analysis.

Results: Fixing a significance threshold at 1.5 fold of change, DHA alone significantly altered the expression of 188 genes, down-regulating 92 and up-regulating 96. IL-1Î² significantly changed the expression of 2031 genes, down-regulating 997 and up-regulating 1034. Treatment with DHA, before IL-1 significantly affected the expression of 116 IL-1Î² -deregulated genes. Immunological, inflammatory and metabolic pathways were the most affected. In particular, newly identified DHA-regulated genes were involved in stemness, cellular growth and proliferation, cardiovascular system development and function, and cancer. These included cytochrome p450 4F2 (CYP4F2), transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²2, caspase recruitment domain (CARD)11, and the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)-A. Conclusions: Endothelial exposure to DHA regulates several novel genes and related pathways. Such unbiased identification improves our understanding of mechanisms by which omega-3 PUFAs may affect human diseases.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Marika Massaro"", ids = ""8558741""); list(name = ""Egeria Scoditti"", ids = ""4350631""); list(name = ""Ma Carluccio"", ids = ""52093526""); list(name = ""Rosanna Martinelli"", ids = ""49687338""); list(name = ""T Buonuomo"", ids = ""84346331""); list(name = ""Valentina Gatta"", ids = ""49879901""); list(name = ""Carlo Storelli"", ids = ""6226325""); list(name = ""Raffaele De Caterina"", ids = ""77360640"")",,,Cardiovascular Research,103,

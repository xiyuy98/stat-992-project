6e7937539e0f6d7b687da8ba9d52ca0e02e75d72,A molecular signature of an arrest of descent in human parturition.,"OBJECTIVE
This study was undertaken to identify the molecular basis of an arrest of descent.


STUDY DESIGN
Human myometrium was obtained from women in term labor (TL; n = 29) and arrest of descent (AODes; n = 21). Gene expression was characterized using Illumina HumanHT-12 microarrays. A moderated Student t test and false discovery rate adjustment were applied for analysis. Confirmatory quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot were performed in an independent sample set.


RESULTS
Four hundred genes were differentially expressed between women with an AODes compared with those with TL. Gene Ontology analysis indicated enrichment of biological processes and molecular functions related to inflammation and muscle function. Impacted pathways included inflammation and the actin cytoskeleton. Overexpression of hypoxia inducible factor-1a, interleukin -6, and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 in AODes was confirmed.


CONCLUSION
We have identified a stereotypic pattern of gene expression in the myometrium of women with an arrest of descent. This represents the first study examining the molecular basis of an arrest of descent using a genome-wide approach.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Pooja Mittal"", ids = ""2617153""); list(name = ""Roberto Romero"", ids = ""145783429""); list(name = ""Adi L Tarca"", ids = ""2490889""); list(name = ""Sorin Draghici"", ids = ""1775019""); list(name = ""Chia-ling Nhan-Chang"", ids = ""1381192972""); list(name = ""Tinnakorn Chaiworapongsa"", ids = ""3985187""); list(name = ""John W.

cf63e2c985477a0c76648f7487f3a8623445e83d,CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 polymorphisms and coronary heart disease risk: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.,"OBJECTIVE
The cytochromes P450 epoxygenases CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 synthesize epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, which regulate endothelial function. We sought to determine if genetic variation in CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 was associated with coronary heart disease risk.


METHODS
We genotyped 2065 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study participants (1085 incident coronary heart disease cases, 980 noncases) for polymorphisms in CYP2J2 and CYP2C8. Using a case-cohort design, associations between genotype and incident coronary heart disease risk were evaluated using proportional hazards regression. The influence of cigarette smoking on these associations was also evaluated. False discovery rate q-values were estimated to minimize the impact of the multiple statistical comparisons completed. All analyses were race stratified.


RESULTS
The CYP2J2 G-50T polymorphism variant -50T allele was associated with significantly lower risk of incident coronary heart disease in African-Americans (adjusted hazard rate ratio 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.35-0.96, P=0.036, q=0.051); however, no significant association was observed in Caucasians. Overall, the I264M, I269F, and K399R polymorphisms in CYP2C8 were not significantly associated with risk of incident coronary heart disease. In Caucasians, the relationship between the I264M and K399R polymorphisms and incident coronary heart disease risk was significantly modified by cigarette smoking status (P for interaction=0.008, q=0.064), with the highest risk observed in smokers carrying at least one variant allele.


CONCLUSIONS
The G-50T polymorphism in CYP2J2 may be an important risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease events in African-Americans, whereas cigarette smoking may modify the relationship between the I264M and K399R polymorphisms in CYP2C8 and coronary heart disease risk in Caucasians. Confirmation of these findings in an independent population is warranted.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Craig R. Lee"", ids = ""5447960""); list(name = ""Kari E.

bfff0935f429911ba92e1d3387ad969a93457a55,Optimization of cDNA microarrays procedures using criteria that do not rely on external standards,"BackgroundThe measurement of gene expression using microarray technology is a complicated process in which a large number of factors can be varied. Due to the lack of standard calibration samples such as are used in traditional chemical analysis it may be a problem to evaluate whether changes done to the microarray procedure actually improve the identification of truly differentially expressed genes. The purpose of the present work is to report the optimization of several steps in the microarray process both in laboratory practices and in data processing using criteria that do not rely on external standards.ResultsWe performed a cDNA microarry experiment including RNA from samples with high expected differential gene expression termed ""high contrasts"" (rat cell lines AR42J and NRK52E) compared to self-self hybridization, and optimized a pipeline to maximize the number of genes found to be differentially expressed in the ""high contrasts"" RNA samples by estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) using a null distribution obtained from the self-self experiment. The proposed high-contrast versus self-self method (HCSSM) requires only four microarrays per evaluation. The effects of blocking reagent dose, filtering, and background corrections methodologies were investigated. In our experiments a dose of 250 ng LNA (locked nucleic acid) dT blocker, no background correction and weight based filtering gave the largest number of differentially expressed genes. The choice of background correction method had a stronger impact on the estimated number of differentially expressed genes than the choice of filtering method. Cross platform microarray (Illumina) analysis was used to validate that the increase in the number of differentially expressed genes found by HCSSM was real.ConclusionThe results show that HCSSM can be a useful and simple approach to optimize microarray procedures without including external standards. Our optimizing method is highly applicable to both long oligo-probe microarrays which have become commonly used for well characterized organisms such as man, mouse and rat, as well as to cDNA microarrays which are still of importance for organisms with incomplete genome sequence information such as many bacteria, plants and fish.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Torunn Bruland"", ids = ""3261696""); list(name = ""Endre Anderssen"", ids = ""143854452""); list(name = ""Berit Doseth"", ids = ""5355342""); list(name = ""Hallgeir Bergum"", ids = ""2523634""); list(name = ""Vidar Beisvag"", ids = ""2278434""); list(name = ""Astrid LÃ¦greid"", ids = ""3124875"")",2edf3e49bf666cd7f41579bb84677f585ee910a8; 23028cbb5a8d3e95d27c6d1cfb11222bf1971c97; c446e60453022fc90612b67948896b4fdd2760e6; ad8bb846991afb5dec5eaf5eba5f261401b729ef; 112275e08597f206f9f9bcd510c241134510b4d4; 2322a32ead1d814e4f69860a8e696d8b4e1e807a,2f9c01ee449df33b2816946cd798e7ff32864ad1; ced6a97a55ce47c8ba4522e5fe863b8a57734f28; f611d912b00408169ac993128e606c2d9df8b4dc; 66999942075e3d3915d6ce975346ae928b8b9d17; 0644a46d9ae742cd746484c8efcc02c2cfddddaf; 5b9d4fef84f288877e9a68f9d662b0c520297300; 425cb3792c8d26e8922964b2c0b703f46d858786; 65d3b6a2a367b8af2cc5ac410c39b927790a7002; 49ad1b8931b2e2d9b048e44098fd512c5a7e7aaa; be3cd122ae87c98220619e3c4bc5f466fb41781a; df0f08a7564e85f80ae76bf3bd4cfab0f85cf4d7; 1d9e0c2f67acd5bf64c659f1f3f8624325b6be8a; 0418f9bd01866eb90b802f6b161b4723e3437c81; 9642a255d180500736415ac36a3c69f3700ab6f9; 2abb2e6ab53a076d3395ccf72b343bdd1dcd1b9a; cdac6b8cdf5c440e2bdbbbdcb37146e8ad96c60d; 1f2cd7df3716cd40e5b68413304a03aa2180a420; 6f8182d4b807f877a2e1102ffc95e4392d37a6d0; 7bde27e449d1d8960bad9d48720466f786a05b09; 8b66dff0d57b824fba319222a3cfa79358571546; 4dc332201b782c116cb909e19a780a67a64b2149; 5721e6b1b047875031eee65a44346f744fd4c919; 82d246140bba30fe09d13d563b38b1cd20f0095a; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; 8af6c84f6c17532ac858d562b104beda1e199bf0; 439bdfaee7597e8b832441b2f833c9e0e4c87211; f7b886a3ccd077179c01c074f1351d9b9695fc3c; 4fa6bedd2bdd46a1a8914f7e2d88990cd1058072; bb2d0d378f82472e4286b451f9b9fb584922321d; c9e7c5ba3194063fae1a503120c528ca9449f2e7; be760c9176c2a9665cdac7fe4f0d3277fcf7977e; 1d395d0712bdecbc1bd1a19b1f40abfc5177f873; f17b17f1f1d513e24fe936f700f5a6566855c99e; ac2903f448faad78e4436a5a0ceb51618d4f4ccc; 845cc25bf27fd406d8ed5e26054e23b39e132e76; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 84d6bb97a21ee1869b01c0c2c3b86a03f797eb7c; b901366e06ea924ab5ad9a27611d811d004a8ee7; 9a66b78916f3410861adb7466d49419001551411; b802b297e40848652e9d3bf80b34d24fea1698bb; 2c9ea0c1487a355694264689b304a700015cd55e; 0b37b92aeb120ccece8d0d1165a7352c3a0e4da8,BMC Genomics,8,377 - 377
454a0479aaa0908e8bd23557e5fca5ab96471de0,Night Shift Work Affects Urine Metabolite Profiles of Nurses with Early Chronotype,"Night shift work can have a serious impact on health. Here, we assess whether and how night shift work influences the metabolite profiles, specifically with respect to different chronotype classes. We have recruited 100 women including 68 nurses working both, day shift and night shifts for up to 5 consecutive days and collected 3640 spontaneous urine samples. About 424 waking-up urine samples were measured using a targeted metabolomics approach. To account for urine dilution, we applied three methods to normalize the metabolite values: creatinine-, osmolality- and regression-based normalization. Based on linear mixed effect models, we found 31 metabolites significantly (false discovery rate <0.05) affected in nurses working in night shifts. One metabolite, acylcarnitine C10:2, was consistently identified with all three normalization methods. We further observed 11 and 4 metabolites significantly associated with night shift in early and late chronotype classes, respectively.

There are currently no well-defined biomarkers of response to treatment that can be used to guide treatment or evaluate recovery in this patient population. APPROACH: In the present study we characterized the levels of novel and emerging circulatingHF biomarkers of HF in patients with severe inotrope-dependent AHF over the first 30 days of medical management or mechanical circulatory support (MCS). We hypothesized that there would be a shared treatment response identifiable in both patient groups, particularly a plasma proteomic signature of inotrope-dependent AHF reversal. DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled a prospective cohort of 25 consecutive patients >19 years of age and supported on at least one inotrope, admitted to St. Paulâ€™s Hospital with AHF. Peripheral blood samples were collected at days 1, 7 and 30 post-admission. Analysis of peripheral blood proteomic biomarkers was performed using semi-targeted multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM) and candidate marker antibody arrays. A subset of patients managed medically who survived to 30 days post-admission without the need for cardiac transplantation or mechanical circulatory support (n1â„48), and patients receiving implantable MCS (n1â„45) were selected for this analysis. Time course plasma samples from the first 30 days of therapy underwent biomarker analyses to generate biomarker signatures characteristic of the response to each treatment modality. Differentially expressed proteins were identified using robust limma with p <0.05 and a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 for MRM and antibody array data. RESULTS: We identified a set of 6 in-common plasma proteins which are differentially regulated in both treatment groups, and two proteins uniquely associated with each therapeutic intervention. Patients managed medically or with implantable MCS had increases in circulating cardiotrophin 1, cardiac troponin T, clusterin, and dickopff 1. Levels of c-reactive protein and growth differentiation factor 15 decreased in both groups over the 30-day time course. CONCLUSION: We have characterized the temporal proteomic signature of clinical recovery in AHF patients managed medically or with MCS, over the first 30 days of treatment. Changes in biomarker expression over the time course may enhance understanding of the biological basis of AHF, including the identification of novel markers and mechanisms of recovery.

ed2dcb40d8aa3e90d01df67b7326d5f960dc8b35,Computational and Mass-Spectrometry-Based Workflow for the Discovery and Validation of Missing Human Proteins: Application to Chromosomes 2 and 14.,"In the framework of the C-HPP, our Franco-Swiss consortium has adopted chromosomes 2 and 14, coding for a total of 382 missing proteins (proteins for which evidence is lacking at protein level). Over the last 4 years, the French proteomics infrastructure has collected high-quality data sets from 40 human samples, including a series of rarely studied cell lines, tissue types, and sample preparations. Here we described a step-by-step strategy based on the use of bioinformatics screening and subsequent mass spectrometry (MS)-based validation to identify what were up to now missing proteins in these data sets. Screening database search results (85,326 dat files) identified 58 of the missing proteins (36 on chromosome 2 and 22 on chromosome 14) by 83 unique peptides following the latest release of neXtProt (2014-09-19). PSMs corresponding to these peptides were thoroughly examined by applying two different MS-based criteria: peptide-level false discovery rate calculation and expert PSM quality assessment. Synthetic peptides were then produced and used to generate reference MS/MS spectra. A spectral similarity score was then calculated for each pair of reference-endogenous spectra and used as a third criterion for missing protein validation. Finally, LC-SRM assays were developed to target proteotypic peptides from four of the missing proteins detected in tissue/cell samples, which were still available and for which sample preparation could be reproduced. These LC-SRM assays unambiguously detected the endogenous unique peptide for three of the proteins. For two of these, identification was confirmed by additional proteotypic peptides. We concluded that of the initial set of 58 proteins detected by the bioinformatics screen, the consecutive MS-based validation criteria led to propose the identification of 13 of these proteins (8 on chromosome 2 and 5 on chromosome 14) that passed at least two of the three MS-based criteria. Thus, a rigorous step-by-step approach combining bioinformatics screening and MS-based validation assays is particularly suitable to obtain protein-level evidence for proteins previously considered as missing.

Il apparait donc comme une nouvelle cible therapeutique potentielle. De plus en plus dâ€™etudes tentent donc de mettre en evidence des facteurs influencant sa composition ou son activite. Parmi les facteurs modifiables, lâ€™alimentation semble etre un contributeur important. Lâ€™objectif de cette etude est de caracteriser les relations entre alimentation et composition du microbiote intestinal au sein dâ€™une population dâ€™adultes en bonne sante. Materiel et methodes Cette etude a ete menee sur 862Â individus en bonne sante de la population Consortium Milieu Interieur. Des donnees alimentaires ont ete collectees via un questionnaire de frequence alimentaire. La composition du microbiote intestinal a ete determinee dans les selles par sequencage du gene codant pour lâ€™ARN ribosomique 16S. Les indices dâ€™Î±-diversite (diversiteÂ : DivÂ ; richesse observeeÂ : Sobs) et la matrice de Î²-diversite (distance de Bray-Curtis) ont ete determines. Les correlations de Spearman ont ete calculees entre chacune des variables alimentaires et les indices dâ€™Î±-diversite. Les associations entre les variables alimentaires et la matrice de Î²-diversite ont ete calculees par PERMANOVA ajustees sur lâ€™IMC, le sexe, lâ€™Ã¢ge et le statut tabagique. Une correction de Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg (False Discovery Rate de 10Â %) a ete appliquee. Resultats et analyse statistique Les correlations de Spearman montrent que 9 (respectivement 6) facteurs sont significativement associes a lâ€™indice Div (respectivement Sobs). Ainsi, Div augmente avec la consommation de poisson, Å“ufs, fruits crus et diminue avec la consommation de viande, viennoiseries, produits frits, plats cuisines, desserts et sodas (r de Spearman compris entre âˆ’0,15Â et 0,13)Â ; et Sobs augmente avec la consommation de poisson et fruits crus et diminue avec la consommation de charcuterie, produits frits, plats cuisines et sodas (r de Spearman compris entre âˆ’0,17Â et 0,13). Les PERMANOVA montrent que 3Â facteurs sont significativement associes a la Î²-diversite. Les consommations de produits laitiers (hors fromages), fruits crus et legumes crus expliquent ainsi 0,577Â % de la variation de la composition globale. Conclusion Cette etude suggere lâ€™existence dâ€™associations entre les consommations alimentaires et differents indicateurs de la composition du microbiote intestinal au sein dâ€™une population dâ€™adultes en bonne sante.

8f4a26ad98e272676b2238bbedf768e5c42f0109,Transferred subgroup false discovery rate for rare post-translational modifications detected by mass spectrometry.,"In shotgun proteomics, high-throughput mass spectrometry experiments and the subsequent data analysis produce thousands to millions of hypothetical peptide identifications. The common way to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) of peptide identifications is the target-decoy database search strategy, which is efficient and accurate for large datasets. However, the legitimacy of the target-decoy strategy for protein-modification-centric studies has rarely been rigorously validated. It is often the case that a global FDR is estimated for all peptide identifications including both modified and unmodified peptides, but that only a subgroup of identifications with a certain type of modification is focused on. As revealed recently, the subgroup FDR of modified peptide identifications can differ dramatically from the global FDR at the same score threshold, and thus the former, when it is of interest, should be separately estimated. However, rare modifications often result in a very small number of modified peptide identifications, which makes the direct separate FDR estimation inaccurate because of the inadequate sample size. This paper presents a method called the transferred FDR for accurately estimating the FDR of an arbitrary number of modified peptide identifications. Through flexible use of the empirical data from a target-decoy database search, a theoretical relationship between the subgroup FDR and the global FDR is made computable. Through this relationship, the subgroup FDR can be predicted from the global FDR, allowing one to avoid an inaccurate direct estimation from a limited amount of data. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with both simulated and real mass spectra.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yan Fu"", ids = ""145817033""); list(name = ""Xiaohong Qian"", ids = ""35216786"")",a4c5dda96c9237eb9eef796ef4c343f98dc1e50b; 9ce9b18a5e062095f57f804d1f439a0f4cb5bce0; 7f1e03d24710c6dae4bc2ee8bc03c2fa912c3bca; 37103b75a9339e1ece024bbda94e213ab81b4372; 405164ba90a9a66250f72a2b20a765e313fb841f; bdf941b1af86214a11872936138db1a4a9b65893; 188dad6fd4ecb915f329651eb8cf528bb9034107; aa3cc8d08f7e0b7c30b6fa5bd848f60851b884a1; 5b1acc92e8eee4556a84ab7ebc6230794a55c93a; cb5e1d9a76d2e9e0956bcffb351a191279577428; 7ef47bf5f495951075fb823ae6db920cba317d3c; 075890bb716c0590252ede3b47a0995dc8fa32b6; 1f897420cd3af1e0f183740cbf91938a8c8f0e38; a20e8c3b75324adc39cd0bb837f0d6e6de087480; 93dcd59dd4d2978173d50dd96994169396271068; 3767243e735b57b2f62632aebf1c1d13e629a6f5; 2681a341924f2dc355a9a98bbc3ca9e090c438e8,41d2dd2029b31fcd30ef8c991981814e45b14a16; cdacb9d12b93a0c55e9ced5524b72ec719a71082; 732e6976bdbd069f0f0f304ddea70bb09a783e38; 03ce51d60641efb5d94b57af201c71d88922241f; 2551f5f20953719f91d69344cd023d78ac591c4e; 70ebaa087efcf176e4589f176625ce72379754fd; d73d7da0caa51b5787ff3f6f885bcc2c1bee9c85; a67f329365ffdaf713215e640ed7081b9b8afe81; 6f7c4b5dba6e92339fae4c92ceb81d93c191b4bc; 0f5751f76cef4a502b22ad088c381a4d0bb10121; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; e7efccfabb3f21c9836c9be8ba397e547a01b078; c9e718ecccc94d8445edf904acd8e5edf258d0e4; 0d7ee3f200a044b594606c9067bbcd1638ec32e3; a90dc3167bb3bbb052d6b2be57730ee354483257; b02583325ca64903c4328ecc688bcb4cc3131a94; 619d8ff694e856110fce6493ffc57eaecf63aeb0; f09d4a533a221b9b85c591ba1dc862dd2fe808a1; f90e8e0de9083fa6e664f29cc69c3b2ded9db616; b950c824c0a7ad64cb8b93a39a6fe2b2bb8e7474; 22b3fce28908df9a20d11121b161e3dbf1c720a5; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 8c9e4b2d1660484a406febe81b6b8585dbc29c61; ebb85be6201bf3ed7ab93d3053efc1b339e86d32; 1dbfa2053ddb473fcb1558eb2f0358381f277a28; 72f6efb41bdf5cd47fe3b9a1353b484a0358aa07; 9bd71270bb9f05cd9d11659dd45ea0b5c7794950; 2c4c300672ea8634f4714432cbd54d9f3f9d37b4; 01411f40e15ea0ff21bdc039daa6cf4ee313dbab,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,13 5,"

ae7d00b287c866f4866d6c9885078b730d54fd90,"FN 1 , but not PAPPA , early in pregnancy","Background: Early detection of pregnancies at risk of complications, such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preeclampsia (PE), is critical for improved monitoring and preventative treatment to optimize health outcomes. We predict that levels of placental-derived proteins circulating in maternal blood reflect placental gene expression, which is associated with placental DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles. As such, placental DNAm profiling may be useful to distinguish pregnancies at risk of developing complications and correlation between DNAm and protein levels in maternal blood may give further evidence for a proteinâ€™s use as a biomarker. However, few studies investigate all clinical parameters that may influence DNAm and/or protein expression, which can significantly affect the relationship between these measures. Results: Candidate genes were chosen based on i) reported alterations of protein levels in maternal blood and ii) observed changes in placental DNAm (Î”Î² > 0.05 and False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.05) in pregnancies complicated by PE/IUGR. Fibronectin (FN1) enhancer DNAm and placental gene expression were inversely correlated (r = âˆ’0.88 p < 0.01). The same trend was observed between promoter DNAm and gene expression for INHBA and PAPPA, though not significant. INHBA and FN1 DNAm was associated with gestationalâ€“age corrected birth weight, while INHA levels were associated with fetal: placental weight ratio and FN1 level was associated with maternal body mass index (BMI). DNAm at the INHBA promoter in the term placenta was negatively correlated with second trimester maternal serum levels (r = âˆ’0.50 p = 0.01) and DNAm at the FN1 enhancer was negatively associated with third trimester maternal serum levels (r = âˆ’0.38, p = 0.009). However, a similar correlation was not found for PAPPA. Conclusions: These results show that establishing a correlation between altered DNAm in the term placenta and altered maternal serum levels of the corresponding protein, is affected by a number of factors. Nonetheless, the correlation between placental DNAm of INHBA/FN1 and maternal serum INHA/FN1 levels indicate that DNAm may be a useful tool to identify novel biomarkers for adverse pregnancy outcomes in some cases.",2015,,"list(name = ""Samantha Louise Wilson"", ids = ""40163065""); list(name = ""John D.

3cd7109cad06f8bf3e054cf41b20be2ce8a5beaf,Whole genome association analysis of treatment response in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Up to 30% of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) exhibit an inadequate response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). To date, genetic predictors of OCD treatment response have not been systematically investigated using genome-wide association study (GWAS). To identify specific genetic variations potentially influencing SRI response, we conducted a GWAS study in 804 OCD patients with information on SRI response. SRI response was classified as â€˜responseâ€™ (n=514) or â€˜non-responseâ€™ (n=290), based on self-report. We used the more powerful Quasi-Likelihood Score Test (the MQLS test) to conduct a genome-wide association test correcting for relatedness, and then used an adjusted logistic model to evaluate the effect size of the variants in probands. The top single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was rs17162912 (P=1.76 Ã— 10âˆ’8), which is near the DISP1 gene on 1q41-q42, a microdeletion region implicated in neurological development. The other six SNPs showing suggestive evidence of association (P<10âˆ’5) were rs9303380, rs12437601, rs16988159, rs7676822, rs1911877 and rs723815. Among them, two SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium, rs7676822 and rs1911877, located near the PCDH10 gene, gave P-values of 2.86 Ã— 10âˆ’6 and 8.41 Ã— 10âˆ’6, respectively. The other 35 variations with signals of potential significance (P<10âˆ’4) involve multiple genes expressed in the brain, including GRIN2B, PCDH10 and GPC6. Our enrichment analysis indicated suggestive roles of genes in the glutamatergic neurotransmission system (false discovery rate (FDR)=0.0097) and the serotonergic system (FDR=0.0213). Although the results presented may provide new insights into genetic mechanisms underlying treatment response in OCD, studies with larger sample sizes and detailed information on drug dosage and treatment duration are needed.",2016,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hai-de Qin"", ids = ""13318035""); list(name = ""Jack Samuels"", ids = ""6525840""); list(name = ""Ying Wang"", ids = ""4516247""); list(name = ""Yun Zhu"", ids = ""144057177""); list(name = ""Marco A Grados"", ids = ""3683730""); list(name = ""Mark A.

Recent progress in DNA microarray technologies allows researchers to perform genome-wide screening to detect differentially expressed genes. Under the paradigm of false discovery rate control, this paper presents sample size methods.


METHODS
The author considers the following two scenarios: 1) planning the sample size to keep the 'burden of testing' (defined as the expected number of genes that have to be tested before a true discovery can be made) below a certain level, and 2) given a fixed amount of budget, balancing the number of subjects to be recruited and the number of genes to be tested to maximize the total number of true discoveries.


RESULTS
The study calculates sample sizes to minimize the burden of testing or to maximize the number of discoveries.


CONCLUSIONS
The present approach to sample size calculation bears more direct relevance to gene-discovery studies.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wen-Chung Lee"", ids = ""34044322"")",,,Annals of epidemiology,20 10,"

8bed3df9e6975248af5537a1bd3e9cc336b0f2b6,Using a Genetic Risk Score Approach to Predict Headache Response to Triptans in Migraine Without Aura,"A large meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies has recently identified a number of risk loci for migraine without aura (MwoA). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a genetic risk score based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), previously reported to be associated with MwoA at genome-wide significance, may influence headache response to triptans in patients with migraine without aura. Genotyping of rs9349379, rs2078371, rs6478241, rs11172113, rs1024905, and rs6724624 was conducted with a real-time PCR allelic discrimination assay in 172 MwoA patients, of whom 36.6% were inconsistent responders to triptans. Each genetic risk score model was constructed as an unweighted score, calculated by adding the number of risk alleles for MwoA across each SNP at selected loci. The association with headache response to triptans was evaluated by logistic regression analysis adjusted for triptan, and the P values were corrected for the false discovery rate. The genetic risk score including susceptibility risk alleles at TRPM8 rs6724624 and FGF6 rs1024905 was found to be inversely associated with risk of inconsistent response to triptans (OR, 0.62; 95%CI, 0.43-0.89; false discovery rate q value, 0.045). In addition, adding this genetic risk score to the triptan-adjusted logistic regression model significantly improved (P = .037) the discrimination accuracy, from 0.57 (95%CI, 0.50-0.65) to 0.64 (95%CI, 0.57-0.72).

b081edbb40542cf03a6bac9caaf78e85c8f53a37,Effect of fatty and lean fish intake on lipoprotein subclasses in subjects with coronary heart disease: a controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND
Fish oil intake reduces serum triglycerides; however, little is known about the effects of dietary fish intake on lipoprotein subclasses.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed at assessing the effect of fatty and lean fish intake on the lipoprotein subclasses in an intervention study.


METHODS
The intervention study included 33 patients with coronary heart disease, who were aged 61.0 Â± 5.8 (mean Â± SD) years. The subjects were randomly assigned to a fatty fish (n = 11), lean fish (n = 12), or control (n = 10) diet for 8 weeks. Fish diets included at least 4 fish meals per week. Subjects in the control group consumed lean beef, pork, and chicken. Lipoprotein subclasses and their lipid components were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.


RESULTS
Concentrations of n-3 fatty acids and docosahexaenoic acid increased in the fatty fish group. The concentrations of cholesterol, cholesterol esters, and total lipids in very large high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) increased in the fatty fish group (overall difference P = .005, P = .002, and P = .007, respectively; false discovery rate P = .04, P = .04, and P = .05, respectively). The mean size of HDL particles increased in the fatty fish group (9.8 Â± 0.3 nm at baseline and 9.9 Â± 0.4 nm at end of study; overall difference P = .004, false discovery rate P = .04). The fish diets did not affect very-low-density lipoprotein or low-density lipoprotein size.


CONCLUSION
Fatty fish intake at least 4 times per week increases HDL particle size which might have beneficial effect in patients with coronary heart disease.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Arja T ErkkilÃ¤"", ids = ""6949094""); list(name = ""Ursula S Schwab"", ids = ""2240868""); list(name = ""Seppo Lehto"", ids = ""5385654""); list(name = ""Vanessa D de Mello"", ids = ""34613024""); list(name = ""Antti J.

26a3f96a4e2f44a16d25a0dc67710cf927ff0084,Radiogenomic characterization of response to chemo-radiation therapy in glioblastoma is associated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR and apoptosis signaling pathways,"Over 40% of Glioblastoma (GBM) patients do not respond to conventional chemo-radiation therapy (chemo-RT) and relapse within 6-9 months, suggesting that they may have been better suited for other targeted therapies. Currently, there are no biomarkers that can reliably predict patients' response to chemo-RT in GBM. We seek to evaluate the role of radiomic markers on pre-treatment MRI to predict GBM patients' response to chemo-RT. Further, to establish a biological underpinning of the radiomic markers, we identified radiogenomic correlates of the radiomic markers with signaling pathways that are known to impact chemo-RT response. A total of 49 studies with Gd-T1w, T2w, FLAIR MRI protocols and corresponding gene expression were obtained from Ivy GAP (n=29) and TCIA (n=20) databases. Responders (n=22) were patients with progression-free survival (PFS) of at least â‰¥ 6 months, while non-responders (n=27) had PFS < 6 months. 13 molecular pathways were curated from the MSigDB Hallmark gene set. For each study, enhancing tumor on MRI was manually segmented by an expert reader. 1390 3D-radiomic features (Gabor, Haralick, and Laws energy) were extracted from this region across all MRI protocols. Joint mutual information identified the 3 most predictive radiomic features in the training set (n=29). This was followed by correlating these features with the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) score computed for every pathway. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained using these 3 features and validated on a test set (n=20) that resulted in an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.71 to distinguish chemo-RT responders from non-responders. Laws energy descriptor (characterizing appearance of edges, spots, and ripples) from the enhancing region on Gd-T1w MR images were found to best predict chemo-RT response. Radiogenomic correlation with GSEA scores revealed that these radiomic features were significantly associated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR (promotes cell proliferation, survival) and apoptosis (programmed cell death) signaling pathways (p < 0.03, False Discovery Rate = 5%).",2019,Engineering; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Niha Beig"", ids = ""14027104""); list(name = ""Prateek Prasanna"", ids = ""39017169""); list(name = ""Virginia Hill"", ids = ""145359908""); list(name = ""Ruchika Verma"", ids = ""3200813""); list(name = ""Vinay Varadan"", ids = ""1955124""); list(name = ""Anant Madabhushi"", ids = ""1705442""); list(name = ""Pallavi Tiwari"", ids = ""2344884"")",,116d2f8bc25b4064fa82f534092630871bf23367; 9de3dc25b248b9d2c30b25fca6adf76106b1c9c7; fb7ff5fbaa27c3751983b9221c44ffc38407dc5a; 59c153190f8081ade395701724038e3dc6f1bacc; 92bd5aeb408f1787d1dc0056e8d4e85911cd4f51; 98bcadabffd510b755e07bd2823bf9f4d8ecb24e; b7ef2ca5483106278039177637f3cd139b1ebc0a; 4a046dc25bdba84fdfc9d9eb0a896da28753669d; 49ebe6f7c173b6d1c85093ad1e3c539314d29554; 6408836505c85a6f4c0bfa7a2150b94939f42f0b; bb3deb034400dffbd114c8510e3e07f99f2481d1; dddf7a1c3306080d083c9c6ca39bfc92401c9195; dd72e977d1348fa0b48f9bc79ece009224df3c95; ea380cd9b76cac1eb778ff3bc1e82e24dc15a716; 4f24274db069a3f8590233903660e707d30067de; bf5a4d0aae456a75c874059d7a21dc098e376dea; 70b457a406504b7fe3c7478bab6f5c277283510e; 6756ce131696223829f3d3dd1cc9e8dcef4458a7; 48c770cbc0aefc035bcdeefd41c7dbab57c1f60a; 3ee2eca1c92dc912855676c4a6286a72d0bd5dfe; 6f2c9e6b997f1d1e7c8c3c44e7dcf31572f70683; d734bbdc444dc4a461a6fec4cc68319dc6cfb14f; 27244a3c55084af4aa33d7a41b6eac202a59b7b6; 4859f412836b6293919163669fe1b363c304bf31; 7ba417187e153b57a10f010ba8025bfbc2aeecc8; ba8d0773da4744ff18e4e1bf55e16494c26b7f8e; 4c8a02cc8effbe1974a06a1bf58c445f23ba87e2; 93d5369a0be3134c6018373d5290923f3d718815; f47a7b3f1678ef112202fbd63cc6bc1bf99d17f9; b72771c316d60190aff053ef8a216ba57d62f541; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 5741e6ea7da0e4baf1c9e4402d09bbd69ea5a605; 6bbc351d763a9e253e51eb96226eda05495070e5; 517f76c5c0c8dd5837d61a34be435f1ae6904931; 38fd86919640e84d40e65f889f429095179f4f40; ed803855d38207d11b8a0377925d3851484b03c9; 685603ed37a04cb87bd60fc0b206c9d4bdf069bb; 929dc2943e84ba6a00c5858a9cd69d71818fe09c; 8fd352ca7d1919b37229ba2541f22856ca92bb17; eadfaefe0862c8ca1108824796634ca2ffe4c268; 95c4c21f580db269ee81e18143de781771061661; 8e229429403d9d0b3006b78c839d43ab25cf851c; e1ea690aa412a563074fd87865721e219df38e5e,,10950,109501B - 109501B-12
f353fc18b26ce838118cfd293afd765447eec7e8,Level of nutrient intake affects mammary gland gene expression profiles in preweaned Holstein heifers.,"Bovine mammary parenchyma (PAR) and fat pad (MFP) development are responsive to preweaning level of nutrient intake. We studied transcriptome alterations in PAR and MFP from Holstein heifer calves (n=6/treatment) fed different nutrient intakes from birth to ca. 65 d age. Conventional nutrient intake received 441 g of dry matter (DM)/d of a control milk replacer (MR) [CON; 20% crude protein (CP), 20% fat, DM basis]. Calves in the accelerated nutrition groups received 951 g/d of high-protein/low-fat MR (HPLF; 28% CP, 20% fat, DM basis), 951 g/d of high-protein/high-fat MR (HPHF; 28% CP, 28% fat, DM basis), or 1,431 g/d of HPHF (HPHF+) MR. Out of 13,000 genes evaluated, over 1,500 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were affected (false discovery rate <0.10) by level of nutrient intake in PAR or MFP. Feeding HPLF versus CON resulted in the most dramatic changes in gene expression, with 278 and 588 DEG having â‰¥1.5-fold change in PAR and MFP. In PAR, the most-altered molecular functions were associated with metabolism of the cell (molecular transport and lipid metabolism) with most of the genes downregulated in HPLF versus CON. In MFP, DEG also were primarily associated with metabolism but changes also occurred in genes linked to cell morphology, cell-to-cell signaling, and immune response. Compared with CON, feeding HPHF or HPHF+ did not result in substantial additional effects on DEG beyond those observed with HPLF. The pentose phosphate, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ubiquinone biosynthesis pathways were among the most enriched due to HPLF versus CON in PAR and were inhibited, whereas glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, and eicosanoid synthesis pathways were among the most enriched due to HPLF versus CON in MFP and were inhibited. These responses suggest that, in PAR, doubling nutrient intake from standard feeding rates inhibited energy metabolism and activity of oxidative pathways that partly serve to protect cells against oxidative stress. The MFP in those heifers appeared to decrease production of lipid-derived metabolites that may play roles in signaling pathways within the adipocyte. Overall, results indicated that prepubertal/preweaned mammary transcriptome is responsive to long-term enhanced nutrient supply to achieve greater growth rates before weaning. The biological significance of these results to future milk production remains to be elucidated.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Paola Piantoni"", ids = ""47784055""); list(name = ""Kristy Marie Daniels"", ids = ""7876164""); list(name = ""Robin E.

The proposed approach, developed in the framework of the M-estimation, is used to provide protection against potential outliers in miRNA expression data. As the study involves multiple comparisons with a large number of circulating miRNAs, robust multiple tests are adopted at a given level of false discovery rate (FDR). Also, due to the uncertainties in the underlying distributions of the miRNA expression data sets, the p-values of the multiple tests are approximated using a permutation method. The empirical properties of the proposed robust tests are studied in simulations.

Of the six SNPs, only ATP2B1 rs17249754 SNP was significantly associated with the risk of hypertension (allelic odds ratio (OR)=1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08â€“1.44, P=0.003). Although all other SNPs showed a trend towards increasing the BP values and risk of hypertension, there was no statistically significant association after false discovery rate analysis. We calculated the weighted risk score using six SNPs, for systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and hypertension. Each additional weighted risk score was associated with SBP by 1.18â€‰mmâ€‰Hg (95% CI=0.62â€“1.73, P<0.001), but not with the DBP (Î²=0.28, 95% CI=(-0.15)-0.74), and overall increased the risk of hypertension by 1.19-fold (95% CI=1.04â€“1.35, P=0.01). The present study confirmed the significant association of ATP2B1 rs17249754 with risk of hypertension among Chinese children, but failed to replicate the association of CSK rs1378942, MTHFR rs1801133, CYP17A1 rs1004467, STK39 rs3754777 and FGF5 rs16998073 with BP/risk of hypertension.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bo Xi"", ids = ""145484805""); list(name = ""Yong-li Shen"", ids = ""80033761""); list(name = ""Xiaoqiang Zhao"", ids = ""47039242""); list(name = ""Giriraj Ratan Chandak"", ids = ""4748927""); list(name = ""Hu Cheng"", ids = ""153625738""); list(name = ""Deren Hou"", ids = ""7996164""); list(name = ""Yajun Li"", ids = ""2559846""); list(name = ""Johannes Ott"", ids = ""145559832""); list(name = ""Yinjunjie Zhang"", ids = ""26006961""); list(name = ""X-l Wang"", ids = ""47120451""); list(name = ""Jie Mi"", ids = ""145226181"")",bf90b74b9d9df5dec84a613f0f4d763dd06318ce; bb715f10fcf17257d7b5b4b1e58679e2d2ec5d59; 628e65751b57fe6f33d3aa45e71a2472518fea66; ac811bf78b761a00098bfb835f499139471a0b2f; 0a6782146a7385de6710e8d9e3b9d31f8b77353b; f1ed9c0718ab1f98e4f8f1434cf9ec53f632658d; 5a73a786c84631b52299c1a8857fb39f8287e4e8; 325ae6e3ff3d233917e99cfc866111108b014c7a; e32a7e2da1960c38c030659506a33b6d8fcbd67e; 2d6be13085107cafda59fe3c72f721675d26deef; 98d708fce9be0967dd9fb4ab12c295d405c3cf25; d4b4f142ec818cb2b4aa2e167ccbd5156ac3a50f; 3c8688981f4754ad897dd1e68a793d875534c899; 207adc1c92b61e1fa19c4f08ffc3d252fec93453; 91b5abb8d3ef226fcb2c98cbbbd8946d03e9c728; 71afdd00f662a17308680f4bbf1736f34f4c6828; cd9e2ed17cc65874d91337912d5be7c9add6ed08; e72e3fe84e02da81ef34d85d4551b14d05e70709; e52dbba8e369d21215c45fff14d09c59cd83a04f; 43c95296c347333becb3508b837c42d04b7bc19b; 48118de65522d36b2fd5603feefcec11ff52ff86; b581d9512feb46fcc76e423b7ad88fb52ed74158; 08e4fc09f7a23b0bff60d02175ece71fabe132a1; 757df5ef8285daabf8b489696975c1e672dc79bc; 86276780e8929545990d078001ae25a66e19b4a0; 4e78ac7eb74fd5aff95b326b381dd19539589fa8; 3a094f4b28186da1ac4ccbddf39283d3f5d5078e; 8f7076fca73f14ba9f055c5905f25099de277d73,feb8d75cf8a7114c77c7b4d509a71ba737027345; 3f601e2d364a3ae0382a528d91936c4fc6452235; 6fdc08f8708718ee3edc03d2ab8cec5a60dabb3a; 1a7d6284777cf2db8457f730f94128fee35e4f72; fc045ec081a8133fb79f2e4f518ae0a2802c7ea9; ff64c05dbc38134f1bad179d34d5128087e4ba9c; c19e4cb5cea3b285db07185cc6344db81311f898; 3a2b942a70bde4481cf12380ef0833bf1bb9f473; 7bf5db6957d1187958519d42bab75bb2e006d7a4; 8c38313066c1273d2f5d189a7a55cd3b9ff3668d; bf8e77927023ed1101e81a1c25642e33bbc36916; ac1341441ccf9bcb1df253a55939681b1caee0d0; 050dbb3c2d97c7aa58c5fe991b2a362ade148ed2; e766c4cdb1e30bb4a2d0d02897ad054921aa7b1c; 27bf20156b08e2a8b626a5a7ced5dd963a95b084; 32e8dc7001838fdf1cfe0f646eb761238d7cae38; 216739a62cfd8116ccb19906a6e2d9f461e20370; 285faea6acaa57531cc7c07a96f02a8cbca5e595; 7cfcd6b5452dccbc6e0ddac1fb3f1dafb202cd0b; ab8f1df8c771526880ade41fef649e2303960bb9; 6b7a3d61c0062ce265861236da2ba01d4250af7f; ce19062b8e61b4e1781a2046f62ad2b4fadb7553; 3d2683198d8fb4f8db7512ee44b20aefdeffd731; 6d55c62776c79b31bd58b1010e607c1dd4024301; 72b42a866b3e963eb2896a782507fe04e7df0b36; 3c537ae5a8b19a8c0c0dd5bc42b02546cfea5354; e63cc2c628cc29b36bb6ed72fc74c098588677e6; 5e079d3378119987ea0c0c99c39f28fd8558f0fb; 68ba35b2ef2568e0874cdab6511526583b844c70; 565949a972d45ff78f810e1155f44dcfb002816c; 9e268062f41323ca8b6bc4018ac73e6fe3f24287; 5813ec22fb8aff12aea8ea8036701475ad699e29; f7d14b76d7a85fddf4801a789bfa8519699e40fb; de9fb90ff6ec27cf296291cc830c0a5daa18b2de; 6ecfeed357b10251fd2fb6461acfec9c9cf1c476; 0003e1ae9ed480e7a708895ad387b5f3a1dc135b; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35,Journal of Human Hypertension,28,32-36
9fe4a1cf6dac990db6bbf2946d1cd375c1b5f9a0,Principal components analysis of diet and alternatives for identifying the combination of foods that are associated with the risk of disease: a simulation study.,"Dietary patterns derived empirically using principal components analysis (PCA) are widely employed for investigating diet-disease relationships. In the present study, we investigated whether PCA performed better at identifying such associations than an analysis of each food on a FFQ separately, referred to here as an exhaustive single food analysis (ESFA). Data on diet and disease were simulated using real FFQ data and by assuming a number of food intakes in combination that were associated with the risk of disease. In each simulation, ESFA and PCA were employed to identify the combinations of foods that are associated with the risk of disease using logistic regression, allowing for multiple testing and adjusting for energy intake. ESFA was also separately adjusted for principal components of diet, foods that were significant in the unadjusted ESFA and propensity scores. For each method, we investigated the power with which an association between diet and disease could be identified, and the power and false discovery rate (FDR) for identifying the specific combination of food intakes. In some scenarios, ESFA had greater power to detect a diet-disease association than PCA. ESFA also typically had a greater power and a lower FDR for identifying the combinations of food intakes that are associated with the risk of disease. The FDR of both methods increased with increasing sample size, but when ESFA was adjusted for foods that were significant in the unadjusted ESFA, FDR were controlled at the desired level. These results question the widespread use of PCA in nutritional epidemiology. The adjusted ESFA identifies the combinations of foods that are causally linked to the risk of disease with low FDR and surprisingly good power.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ioannis Bakolis"", ids = ""6795674""); list(name = ""Peter G.

d0ca69a76bfba5281cbfb3e7297fa8656ba31c83,Su17: Altered Brain Connectivity in Patients with 16p11.2,"Background Copy Number Variants (CNVs) at the 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 locus are among the most common genetic risk factors associated with neurodevelopmental disorders [1]. Deletion (DEL) have been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Duplication (DUP) with Schizophrenia and ASD. Voxel-based morphometry studies have revealed a robust association between the number of 16p11.2 genomic copies and global brain volume, as well as regional structural changes in key areas of the reward system, language circuitry and social cognition [2]. Our goal is to examine the effect of 16p11.2 CNVs on functional brain organization and its relationship with alterations in brain structure. Methods This study was conducted in a cohort of 20 16p11.2 DEL carriers, 19 DUP carriers and 74 controls (CON) [3]. Mean age was 23.8 yrsÂ±14.9. Resting-state fMRI and structural scans were acquired at two sites on Siemens 3Â T TIM Trio scanners using the same sequences (EPI: TR=3000; TE=30; scan time=06:12, flip angle=90). fMRI data were corrected for slice timing and subject motion and registered to MNI space [4] using the NIAK pipeline [5]. Timepoints with excessive head-motion (> 0.5mm) were removed [6]. Subjects with low time points ( Pairwise functional connectivity was estimated as the correlation between the average time series of 64 brain regions [7]. We then fitted a linear model to each connection with the CNV status, subject motion, sex and recording site as explanatory factors. Differences between CNV status groups were then tested by post-hoc contrasts. Each contrast was controlled for false discovery rate (FDR) across all connections at q Results Connectivity of regions in the basal ganglia, medial temporal gyrus and precuneus showed significant differences for the DEL vs CON, and DEL vs DUP contrasts. Specifically, connections among basal ganglia regions (caudate, thalamus, putamen) and between basal ganglia regions and superior and inferior temporal gyri showed significant overconnectivity in DEL group compared to both CON and DUP. Finally, connections between the caudate, superior frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule were found to be stronger in DEL than DUP. No significant differences of functional connectivity were found for the DUP vs CON contrast. We examined in a larger normative dataset whether changes in global brain volumes may mediate these changes but found no relationship between brain volume and connections altered in deletion carriers. Discussion Our results are concordant with previous findings of structural brain alterations in 16p11.2 DEL carriers. Striato-striatal and striato-cortical over-connectivity in the DEL carriers is consistent with previous reports of aberrant functional connectivity in ASD [10]. As previously observed the effect size of the duplication on brain structure and cognitive traits is smaller than the effects of the deletion. A larger sample size is likely required to observe the changes in connectivity associated with the duplication. 1. 10.1038/nature13908 2. 10.1038/mp.2014.145 3. 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.02.014 4. 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.07.033 5. niak.simexp-lab.org 6. 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.018 7. 10.6084/m9.figshare.1285615 8. www.jstor.org/stable/2346101 9. 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.07.071 10. 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.10.029",2019,Psychology,"list(name = ""Clara Moreau"", ids = ""153749067""); list(name = ""Sebastian Urchs"", ids = ""6134347""); list(name = ""Simons Variation in Individuals Project Consortium"", ids = ""88725904""); list(name = ""Alan Evans"", ids = ""144159539""); list(name = ""SÃ©bastien Jacquemont"", ids = ""145693335"")",,,European Neuropsychopharmacology,29,s895-s896
4e5066e89058a3a711aea359c709af5acf1dbbdf,Chromosome 5q loss in colorectal flat adenomas.,"PURPOSE
Flat adenomas are a subgroup of colorectal adenomas that have been associated with a more aggressive clinical behavior compared with their polypoid counterparts. Here, we aimed to compare one of the molecular changes most explicitly associated with adenoma to carcinoma progression, that is, chromosomal instability, between flat and polypoid colorectal adenomas.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Consecutive series of 83 flat and 35 polypoid adenomas were analyzed for DNA copy number changes using a high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization platform, microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and for mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Immunohistochemical stainings for CD3, CD8, and FoxP3 expression were carried out.


RESULTS
Patterns of DNA copy number changes differed between the two phenotypes, with significantly more frequent loss of 5q14.3 and 5q15-q31.1 in flat adenomas, whereas losses of 1p36.32-p35.3, 10q25.3, 17p12, and chromosome 18 were more frequent in polypoid adenomas (false discovery rate < 0.2). MSI was observed in one flat adenoma. As the 5q15-q31.1 region harbors the APC locus, APC mutation status was investigated, showing significantly less mutations in flat adenomas (P = 0.04). An initial exploration of a possible association of 5q loss with inflammation indicated that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were more abundant in the stroma of flat adenomas compared with that of polypoid adenomas.


CONCLUSION
Flat and polypoid adenomas have partially distinct chromosomal profiles, consistent with differences in the biology underlying these phenotypes. Alterations more specific to flat adenomas, in particular 5q loss, may be associated with inflammation.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Quirinus J. M.

9fb8410006d80bd94c7858152699a93d7f3cff3d,The Evolution of Gene Expression in Mouse Hippocampus in Response to Selective Breeding for Increased Locomotor Activity,"Abstract The evolution of behavior has been notoriously difficult to study at the molecular level, but mouse genetic technology offers new promise. We applied selective breeding to increase voluntary wheel running in four replicate lines of Mus domesticus (S mice) while maintaining four additional lines through random breeding to serve as controls (C mice). The goal of the study was to identify the gene expression profile of the hippocampus that may have evolved to facilitate the increased voluntary running. The hippocampus was of interest because it is known to display marked physiological responses in association with wheel running itself. We used high-density oligonucleotide arrays representing 11,904 genes. To control for the confounding influence of physical activity itself on gene expression, animals were housed individually without access to running wheels, and were sampled during the day when they are normally inactive. Two-month-old female mice in estrus were used (n = 16 total; two per line; 8 S and 8 C). After correcting for an acceptable false discovery rate (10%), 30 genes, primarily involved in transcription and translation, significantly increased expression whereas 23 genes, distributed among many categories including immune function and neuronal signaling, decreased expression in S versus C mice. These changes were relatively small in magnitude relative to the changes in gene expression that occur in the hippocampus in response to wheel running itself. A priori tests of dopamine receptor expression levels demonstrated an increase of approximately 20% in the expression of D2 and D4 receptors. These results suggest that relatively small changes in the expression patterns of hippocampal genes underlie large changes in phenotypic response to selection, and that the genetic architecture of running motivation likely involves the dopaminergic system as well as CNS signaling machinery.",2004,,"list(name = ""Anne M.

43df40940722c09a776248ab4a090774dd29b704,Large-Scale Multiple Testing of Correlations.,"Multiple testing of correlations arises in many applications including gene coexpression network analysis and brain connectivity analysis. In this paper, we consider large scale simultaneous testing for correlations in both the one-sample and two-sample settings. New multiple testing procedures are proposed and a bootstrap method is introduced for estimating the proportion of the nulls falsely rejected among all the true nulls. The properties of the proposed procedures are investigated both theoretically and numerically. It is shown that the procedures asymptotically control the overall false discovery rate and false discovery proportion at the nominal level. Simulation results show that the methods perform well numerically in terms of both the size and power of the test and it significantly outperforms two alternative methods. The two-sample procedure is also illustrated by an analysis of a prostate cancer dataset for the detection of changes in coexpression patterns between gene expression levels.",2016,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tengfei Cai"", ids = ""49282956""); list(name = ""Weidong Liu"", ids = ""2202986"")",3e1045b3927a4a609108cadf5fc7f38856044bb5; edd55ca6dc7cec89787af4b3d9818040466a519f; a2040906a76394de8efa0a3eb95105896473196b; 0899202aa8d5e706af4cd6d74f6e944949b0d9bc; 6de25f28f84c031d066466e04576b7038b85a403; 5c3df4a20540a110f0501c40efd44db9d1567499; a13f15b97d1d35812c4347696fe764eb8631dd70; 24e5b048340f27cd2aa6dc115b7df443dcf77b3b; d0ac3e12d5ccaaef73e1ddf0c003068cdbf37c99; da5a6f4bcc3d0a51ef73bc068f7f4254af8d5e19; f894480feb384ec064962637bbcba1a3b45716ab; e67bccacc04a883170bfe9e038e7938445d1d084; ab50d8661b6575502b87582d157987fb4de83ba0; a28c02d7128658ffa6b465230fb4c306f62e9ccc; b1189f86f84ba858136c424af073a04461d5e362; 81388b4bcc6b520c242729bf4f581cf01f0c9f42,7f6c762158e1e97d60a59ca423368cdfbdbd2338; 1136bdc2b4a1ced7eba31fc2977ea50d2c480ba0; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 9b696d3b3ff8aa7ce79335616c28d667f85118df; 453ad9b414c1b35492e7b5b455cfca5684556e9c; 95b1ddb21d6a0b66176ac3a9489e6e352d4eb697; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; 0acc508d0066a2eb16feefed6f9a8ffa0bb5227f; 4e031ada3d6c298700b3d4b6826232013d810d9e; 4116adb2fad723ff1f5f2fe555df22087beb58ee; 18a15fb30fea21240060e645748526643f3de96f; 415c535626ccbaa0d68ac0a457c3ae77d504c08c; 98289dc05d507158f466a7d67d622fc5b57e3c69; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98; 48357eaa6dd8e31536316d7006c32e6a66e36ccb; 2aa6ac924f194ad34b8b94806f11e47d2791ef69; a73932d368f9a4ad68fb558613fd447cba5567b2; 76f667df49db0e5a3a2f4fdd45995a120d3a6c32; f35dfefdd5c44c5e717e17bb72c273b22b0878f1; e2a187c6ec22b531a438bfa65b679b9a1a87597d; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 5e147ca57ea8ba09c571abc2fb75a02724c1b611; bd53ebf7e28d0ee4d6904be1875c5a931d5b28bf; c985e871ea5647d070f1d2679e8ef5ce4a003ca3; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc; ef8161b95ba86b2644b56bfffa54f0926843376a; 3ad3283d0d520e01deef6e5c010e17ae295e0484; 3a1311d1bfaee397913dcccd232d462580d0e8d7; a66fd5a19b687bcb39c5131a1619fa04ee5e785e; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf,Journal of the American Statistical Association,111 513,"

Hitherto unrecognised patterns may define sub-phenotypes with different pathogenesis and specific treatment needs. Based on autoantibody profile we therefore investigated phenotypic clusters and explored cluster associations with clinical manifestations and one of the most important genetic risk factors for SLE, HLA-DRB1 alleles. 908 SLE Caucasian patients and 3654 age- gender- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls (HC) were included. We determined the occurrence of 13 autoantibodies: dsDNA, nucleosomes, ribosomal P, RNP68, RNPA, Sm, Sm/RNP, SSA52, SSA60, SSB, aCL-IgG/IgM and aB2GP1. HLA-DRB1 typing was performed by sequence-specific primer polymerase chain reaction assay. Cluster analysis was done using Gower distance matrix, followed by partition around medoids cluster calculation and Silhouette metric for number of clusters validation. Chi-square test, odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals and false discovery rate p value (p) were calculated for the association tests. Four clusters were defined based on autoantibody occurrence. 29%, dominated by antiâ€“SSA52/60/SSB positivity is strongly associated with HLAâ€“DRB1*03 when compared to HC (4.1[3.4â€“4.9] p=6.4Eâ€“56) and other clusters (OCs) (2.9[93.3â€“3.6] p=1.1Eâ€“19). Discoid lesions were more common vs OCs (1.8[1.3â€“2.6] p=0.02). 29%, dominated by antiâ€“SmRNP/Sm/DNA/RNPA/RNP68/nucleosome, was specifically associated with HLAâ€“DRB1*15 when compared to HC (1.7[1.6â€“2.1] p=5.7Eâ€“6) and other clusters (1.5[1.1â€“1.9] p=0.01). Nephritis was common vs OCs (1.9[1.4â€“2.7) p=2.Eâ€“03) 24%, dominated by antiâ€“B2GP1/aCLâ€“IgG/IgM, was associated with HLAâ€“DRB1*04 when compared with other clusters (1.8[1.4â€“2.4] p=2Eâ€“4). More thrombotic events vs OCs were observed in this group (1.84 [1.3â€“2.6] p=0.01) 18% was negative for the 13 tested autoantibodies and was not associated with any specific HLAâ€“DRB1 alleles and it was not associated as risk factor for any of the evaluated clinical manifestations. We demonstrate that immune-phenotypes/clusters in SLE can fit into a frame of HLA-DRB1 alleles and that the overall association between SLE and HLA-DRB1*03 and HLA-DRB1*15 seems to be driven mainly by clusters 1 and 2, respectively. We also confirm previous observations that autoantibody clusters associate with clinical symptoms. We believe that these results could be used to redefine SLE, determine predictive biomarkers and inclusion criteria for clinical trials.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lm Diaz Gallo"", ids = ""86956573""); list(name = ""Emeli LundstrÃ¶m"", ids = ""36111078""); list(name = ""Vilija Oke"", ids = ""39229226""); list(name = ""Kerstin Elvin"", ids = ""50793432""); list(name = ""Yongren Wu"", ids = ""12116466""); list(name = ""Johanna T.

bedd1b4af2b03292499d651a6cfd300143215534,The computational analysis of human testis transcriptome reveals closer ties to pluripotency,"AIMS
The purpose of this study was to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEG) in human testis and also evaluate the relationship between human testis, human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESC), mouse testis and mouse ESCs (mESC).


SETTINGS AND DESIGN
It is a prospective analysis designed computationally.


METHODS AND MATERIAL
The microarray data for human testis, hESCs, mouse testis and mESCs were obtained from NCBI-GEO and analyzed for identification of DEGs. The results were then compared with mouse testis and extended to ESCs.


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED
Data was analyzed in R using various Bioconductor packages. To identify DEGs, 2-fold cut-off and a False Discovery Rate (FDR) below 0.01 criterions was used.


RESULTS
A total 2868 transcripts (DEGs) were found to be significantly up-regulated and 2011 transcripts significantly down-regulated in human testis compared to other normal tissues. Of the up-regulated transcripts, 232 transcripts were grouped as unclassified i.e. had unknown annotations at the time of analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) based functional annotation of testis specific DEGs indicate that most of the DEGs (~80%) are involved in various metabolic processes. Pathway analysis shows over-representation of Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway. A core group of 67 transcripts were found to be common among human testis, mouse testis, hESCs and mESCs.


CONCLUSIONS
Testis seems to be metabolically very active relative to other normal tissues as indicated by functional annotation. The comparison of human and mouse testis shows conserved functions and pathways involved in both species. Large numbers of genes were found conserved between testis and ESCs suggesting very close expression level relationship between reproductive organs and complex phenomenon such as dedifferentiation and reprogramming.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""M.

Secondary metabolites in eucalypts are important mediators of a diverse community of herbivores. We used a candidate gene approach to investigate genetic associations between 195 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 24 candidate genes and 33 traits related to secondary metabolites in the Tasmanian Blue Gum (Eucalyptus globulus). We discovered 37 significant associations (false discovery rate (FDR) Q < 0.05) across 11 candidate genes and 19 traits. The effects of SNPs on phenotypic variation were within the expected range (0.018 < r(2) < 0.061) for forest trees. Whereas most marker effects were nonadditive, two alleles from two consecutive genes in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway (MEP) showed additive effects. This study successfully links allelic variants to ecologically important phenotypes which can have a large impact on the entire community. It is one of very few studies to identify the genetic variants of a foundation tree that influences ecosystem function.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Carsten KÃ¼lheim"", ids = ""6253663""); list(name = ""Suat Hui Yeoh"", ids = ""5909127""); list(name = ""Ian R.

Borderline personality disorder is associated with severe psychiatric presentations and has been linked to variability in brain structure. Dimensional models of borderline personality traits (BPTs) have become influential; however, associations between BPTs and brain structure remain poorly understood.


METHODS
We tested whether BPTs are associated with regional cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and subcortical volumes (nÂ = 152 brain structure metrics) in data from the Duke Neurogenetics Study (nÂ = 1299) and Human Connectome Project (nÂ = 1099). Positive control analyses tested whether BPTs are associated with related behaviors (e.g., suicidal thoughts and behaviors, psychiatric diagnoses) and experiences (e.g., adverse childhood experiences).


RESULTS
While BPTs were robustly associated with all positive control measures, they were not significantly associated with any brain structure metrics in the Duke Neurogenetics Study or Human Connectome Project, or in a meta-analysis of both samples. The strongest findings from the meta-analysis showed a positive association between BPTs and volumes of the left ventral diencephalon and thalamus (p values < .005 uncorrected, p values > .1 false discovery rate-corrected). Contrasting high and low BPT decile groups (nÂ = 552) revealed no false discovery rate-significant associations with brain structure.


CONCLUSIONS
We find replicable evidence that BPTs are not associated with brain structure despite being correlated with independent behavioral measures. Prior reports linking brain morphology to borderline personality disorder may be driven by factors other than traits (e.g., severe presentations, comorbid conditions, severe childhood adversity, or medication) or reflect false positives. The etiology or consequences of BPTs may not be attributable to brain structure measured via magnetic resonance imaging. Future studies of BPTs will require much larger sample sizes to detect these very small effects.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""David A. Baranger"", ids = ""145809098""); list(name = ""Lauren R.

Eagle* 1, Jianguo Zhuang1, Rosalind Jenkins2, Neil Kitteringham2, Melanie Oates1, Kevin Park2, Anna Schuh3, Stephen Devereux4, Peter Hillmen5, Andrew Pettitt1 1Department of Molecular & Clinical Cancer Medicine, 2MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, 3Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, 4 Department of Haematological Medicine, Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, 5Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom Background: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) is notable for its clinical variability, suggesting a role for precision medicine. Attempts at understanding the biological basis of this variability have mainly focussed on genomic alterations and gene expression at the mRNA level. However, the molecular basis of CLL variability remains incompletely understood. We speculate that this is because the clinical phenotype is ultimately determined by gene expression at the protein level. We have therefore embarked on a global proteomic study of a large number of CLL trial samples for which whole genome sequencing data will be available through the Genomics England Ltd (GEL) CLL Pilot Project. We anticipate that our study will bridge the gap in our understanding between genotype and clinical phenotype. Aims: Recently developed mass spectrometric approaches to highly parallel, label-free protein quantification provide a new opportunity to develop diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers. SWATH (Sequential Windowed Acquisition of all THeoretical fragments) is a data-independent approach which generates a mass spectral library of fragment ions from all detectable peptide precursors. The composite MS/MS spectra are deconvoluted by alignment with a high quality and exhaustive, tissue specific database, whereupon patient samples may be stratified based on the quantitative expression profile of thousands of proteins. Here, we describe generation of a CLL-specific protein database that will provide a permanent reference source for all future trial samples, as indicated in Figure 1. Methods: Protein extracts were prepared from CLL cells from 14 individual patients in various stages of the disease. Lysates were pooled and digested before being subjected to cation exchange chromatography. Forty fractions were delivered into a TripleTOF 6600 mass spectrometer (SCIEX) via an Eksigent nanoLC 415 system (SCIEX). Data dependent acquisition was performed using 25 MS/MS per cycle to optimise for quality and 30 MS/MS per cycle to optimise for coverage, and the combined data were searched using ProteinPilot 5.0 (SCIEX) against the SwissProt database (Nov 2015, 20,193 human entries). Proteins lying within a 1% global false discovery rate were included in the database. Results: The new CLL-specific database contains 7773 proteins. The database covers 50% of all human UniProtKB/SwissProt entries which have evidence at the protein level. Pathway analysis of B cell receptor (BCR) signalling based on the GeneGo pathway maps in the MetaCore database (version 6.14, build 61508; Thomson Reuters) showed that this CLL database covers over 87% of the proteins involved in BCR signalling. The quality of the database entries is further underlined by high representation in the Human Genome database (20,814 entries) in aspect of Gene Ontology biological processes and molecular functions, as determined by PANTHER over-representation tests.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Gina L.

3b1dbb4c0a2d51a488d5b8e1a9e57bec856da178,False Discovery Rate Control in Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies via Markov Random Fields,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used to study population effects of factors on brain morphometry. Inference from such studies often require the simultaneous testing of millions of statistical hypotheses. Such scale of inference is known to lead to large numbers of false positive results. Control of the false discovery rate (FDR) is commonly employed to mitigate against such outcomes. However, current methodologies in FDR control only account for the marginal significance of hypotheses, and are not able to explicitly account for spatial relationships, such as those between MRI voxels. In this article, we present novel methods that incorporate spatial dependencies into the process of controlling FDR through the use of Markov random fields. Our method is able to automatically estimate the relationships between spatially dependent hypotheses by means of maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation and the pseudo-likelihood information criterion. We show that our methods have desirable statistical properties with regards to FDR control and are able to outperform noncontexual methods in simulations of dependent hypothesis scenarios. Our method is applied to investigate the effects of aging on brain morphometry using data from the PATH study. Evidence of whole brain and component level effects that correspond to similar findings in the literature is found in our investigation.",2014,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hien Duy Nguyen"", ids = ""153609534""); list(name = ""Geoffrey J.

c70828873ef041ba2450041b38080e47c6d67f84,Proteomic Characterization of the Extracellular Matrix of Human Uterine Fibroids,"Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) are the most common benign tumors that are associated with increased production of extracellular matrix (ECM). Excessive ECM deposition plays a major role in the enlargement and stiffness of these tumors and contributes to clinical symptoms, such as abnormal bleeding and abdominal pain. However, no study so far has explored the global composition of the ECM of fibroids and normal myometrium. In this study, we performed a systematic ECM enrichment procedure and comparative proteomic analyses to profile the ECM composition of genetically annotated different-sized fibroids (small, medium, and large) and adjacent normal myometrium (ANM). Our matrisome analysis identified a combined total of 108, 126, 126, and 130 unique ECM and ECM-associated proteins with a confidence corresponding to a false discovery rate <1% in ANM and in small, medium, and large fibroids, respectively. The majority of fibroid ECM proteins belong to the core matrisome that includes glycoproteins, collagens, and proteoglycans. Considering that the small-sized fibroids represent the initial stages of leiomyogenesis, we highlighted some of the most abundant and important upregulated ECM proteins in small fibroids (i.e., POSTN, TNC, COL3A1, COL24A1, and ASPN). Furthermore, we revealed 30 unique ECM proteins that exist only in fibroids but that are not present in ANM regardless of MED12 mutation. We propose that some of the proteins identified represent potential novel ECM drug targets that may change the paradigm of fibroid treatment.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""M Fairuz B Jamaluddin"", ids = ""144713035""); list(name = ""Pravin Nahar"", ids = ""16172602""); list(name = ""Pradeep S Tanwar"", ids = ""2362913"")",0c3f0db02ed9723fdbee2eda5bf750f8a3f8ab06; bb177e43b476ecbaaa70ea0440dd95385c80b0d7,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 796442f311e1f9ac11fd923a7540455a489aabd3; 66a2bfb77cc0a6e05a6b6092de4b558662838abc; e084adc6f99078ae804a37c369355816175a1696; 0c4225bcc81ce3b84ac5b3bc2df8cc2724dca459; abc082a69425dfeac731ea06138fcffd3ea17208; b4659496c32ec6f304b187fb78fe95406f1ff4b4; 35360c36665a938afd61f9b327bb2599881d268e; 3cc9005751edcea2617550b1e9dc4833416395d8; b1b343c316cb603b2d3bdd31cf90e474cb7192f1; d73b9dd1140da225872f246065d29227c94df001; c62c9c2345aaa84ef3226a830cba4fe93a9cfacf; 4c10f1b7ef4bd1faad5c6d3925c00316c45b6121; f3f23303495ed95d3c4c406bb6bcc7376411f186; bd99b5d8f742097ac0c968148b3b89835a2a120b; fe496b10a34a236542c2af1bb21acd81321a8166; 3b5c79570169c2abcf9910cb6038a3f418675f00; dc3c828be239c2ff8a0100d652b9376bc54a0025; 032e31c5763ec261cc2aef1e2a12637bef62b6e1; 319c6e34bd1867c4b00464cc3e1f79cc17b10f5c; 294abd04b63b29ee651e8980a68784c86be60f71; a2d5fc6adfb0b2ec81b317e8eff6aab9767becee; 3ee701fbca656760cb981999a3a4d4be9248b5d2; 7c7f16cf4a3d0761e2c1d59358a8df03749bf147; b0a3ed549e843d95cabc6b4494d3cf0ade3c1946; 0151747c626af241fac4fb4bca7caf95c2872766; e49a335426384e90365a81577411b5993600826a; da6074d20a90b417eb7f0fdffd218863f17fd1f0; d5afaf6e7488f61036c5e83db9830c11e60f0fc5; 768c8eabcb0624f2a206ddff6b1b39f5be7e3d14; 6e6c446acf88b614deb847b43a62f04593a182e0; a45f0a15b203c10313f2bb03a9dc6b08771a0ab1; cc372e52e7cdbb283117b5fc179f30acb9be9d95; 938381a7a2027bfb25acb0e789933920c52f535f; ac924eccc3bfe0f400a99ef32396172dc79e09d2; c02669c5c7249663d5864aeb74cdc80d518acd98; 2815f052319f3767251c18f38401f093d13f32bf; fc9ef4f19495bb354e7248919de86612071df6c0; 4e12952d15089f4a83cb6a33b77a7e1d7a58d16e; 254022504a2f03dd5ab3993c7c5e29b9b64cc6b7; 053b38818f25a0635427e1e8825c51ce546eee0a; ab24259605340c1203f66cd18f598b1411ff1d4f; f8d48976da29da0a0966c00ce223f34e67da9f51,Endocrinology,159,2656â€“2669

For the costly future decisions, there is little room for error. Features must provide substantial evidence to be robust for classification and dependable for important decisions. Here we seek statistical evidence for feature selection, that feature signals are of sufficient magnitude and frequency to be generalizable for classification. The Bayesian false discovery rate (bFDR) error control procedure is powerfully suited for this task. In realistic situations often encountered in practice, the bFDR procedure is biased, yielding a greater than desired FDR. In other less typical cases, the FDR is less than desired. We investigate the sources of bias in the bFDR procedure, and predict the direction of bias. A new algorithm has been developed to recover the bias in the bFDR control procedure. In simulation and real data mining examples, the new bFDR control algorithm shows promise. The strengths and limitations of the new approach are presented with examples and discussed.",2012,Computer Science,"list(name = ""David L.

Useful insights can be obtained by identifying genes that are differentially regulated during chronic lithium treatment. Toward this end, we have used microarray technology to identify mRNAs that are differentially expressed in a human neuronal cell line that has been continuously maintained in therapeutic levels of lithium for 33 days. Significantly, unlike other transcriptomes where predominantly rodent cells were used and a limited number of genes probed, we have used human cells probed with more extensive 44,000 gene microarrays. A total of 671 differentially regulated transcripts, after correcting for false discovery rates, were identified, of which 347 and 324, respectively, were found to be up- and downregulated. Peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), an antioxidant enzyme, was the most upregulated while tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3), a pro-apoptotic protein, was the most downregulated, implying a beneficial effect of lithium on neuronal cells. Several of the most highly regulated genes are novel, uncharacterized and encode proteins of unknown function. Differentially expressed genes associated with phosphoinositide metabolism include those encoding phosphatidyl inositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase type II alpha (PIP5K2A), WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 1 protein (WIPI49), tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3) and sorting nexin 14 (SNX14). A protein interactome using some of the saliently regulated genes identified protein kinase C (PKC) as a major target for lithium action while a global analysis of all 671 differentially expressed genes identified the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway as the most regulated. The list of highly regulated genes, besides encoding putative targets for antimanic agents, should prove useful in defining novel pathways, or to better understand the mechanisms, underlying the mood stabilization process.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ratnam S Seelan"", ids = ""6009507""); list(name = ""Abdelnaby Khalyfa"", ids = ""49378099""); list(name = ""Jaganathan Lakshmanan"", ids = ""49015148""); list(name = ""Manuel F Casanova"", ids = ""9801200""); list(name = ""Ranga N.

8ba8c1ae51e62c098a55d9cbbdba7c7ac08edc52,Changes in the default mode networks of individuals with long-term unilateral sensorineural hearing loss,"Hearing impairment contributes to cognitive dysfunction. Previous studies have found changes of functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) associated with cognitive processing in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Whereas the changes in the DMN in patients with long-term unilateral SNHL (USNHL) is still not entirely clear. In this work, we analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and neuropsychological test scores from normal hearing subjects (n = 11) and patients (n = 21) with long-term USNHL. Functional connectivity and nodal topological properties were computed for every brain region in the DMN. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and post hoc analyses were conducted to identify differences between normal controls and patients for each measure. Results indicated that the left USNHL presented enhanced connectivity (p < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected), and significant changes (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) of the nodal topological properties in the DMN compared with the control. More changes in the DMN have been found in the left than right long-term USNHL (RUSNHL). However, the neuropsychological tests did not show significant differences between the USNHL and the control. These findings suggest that long-term USNHL contributes to changes in the DMN, and these changes might affect cognitive abilities in patients with long-term USNHL. Left hearing loss affects the DMN more than the right hearing loss does. The fMRI measures might be more sensitive for observing cognitive changes in patients with hearing loss than clinical neuropsychological tests. This study provides some insights into the mechanisms of the association between hearing loss and cognitive function.",2015,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""G. -Y.

While metabolic stable isotope labeling has been the method of choice, it is often not possible to apply such an approach. Four different label free ways of calculating expression ratios in a classic ""two-state"" experiment are compared: signal intensity at the peptide level, signal intensity at the protein level, spectral counting at the peptide level, and spectral counting at the protein level. The quantitative data were mined from a dataset of 1245 qualitatively identified proteins, about 56% of the protein encoding open reading frames from Porphyromonas gingivalis, a Gram-negative intracellular pathogen being studied under extracellular and intracellular conditions. Two different control populations were compared against P. gingivalis internalized within a model human target cell line. The q-value statistic, a measure of false discovery rate previously applied to transcription microarrays, was applied to proteomics data. For spectral counting, the most logically consistent estimate of random error came from applying the locally weighted scatter plot smoothing procedure (LOWESS) to the most extreme ratios generated from a control technical replicate, thus setting upper and lower bounds for the region of experimentally observed random error.",2007,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Qiangwei Xia"", ids = ""35673589""); list(name = ""Tiansong Wang"", ids = ""1898552""); list(name = ""Yoonsuk Park"", ids = ""5057560""); list(name = ""Richard J Lamont"", ids = ""2135121""); list(name = ""Murray Hackett"", ids = ""2204931"")",fb5c471a28a2ee4e5b2d1803fee9e6989db1a08b; 889816da47716a2a5c1cbf842f82136147080ae5; e62a2aa0aa482871a28353a013f606b2f6875168; e1be398a0e9f6e2186ed1d0c4ea1fefb2314a1e0; 2d3b6309683b73f24eb40de89eb23cc26638e981; f678b036aec72d9e67ab0836a476042d713a8013; c055e662b54370c8b0b2cdd0ef9d3a3d59959905; b9245bd1fdf28b90e0f5b8facb76f4bde88ff01f; 0dd6e79ccd19b62f6ce5ddc63dec1281008c385d; b699ae5d5dae21f0e829d266166c63caf7501856; 458e3399947df1b468bdd6f7116fb8a9c664c42a; a33658ed9601329bff9333219efd8900c7a243ae; fef89672afa09f43fb8e2670ad8fcd879197a1bb; 0909e4af86ff4a0b24db87852e093d6def190119; 55fc27e3d5b1b60fb1663731567ef510516eb768; 80a29a6cb15685730f1ace39f51e5943341ef8e2; 8a5eae38e6001bdd5821e3b960d5ad3f6700c737; ebba0fd42b95b041d30e9a8abceb60562fb6c163; 27e589ca88f1e08797b704beceb6b6c486aa686c; ab5801fa537259c4fcc2090dfaf0647d0137095d,,International journal of mass spectrometry,259 1-3,"

The phenotypes under study were 12 FAF previously identified through factor analysis and classified as follows: de novo FA (F1), branched-chain FA-milk yield (F2), biohydrogenation (F3), long-chain fatty acids (F4), desaturation (F5), short-chain fatty acids (F6), milk protein and fat contents (F7), odd fatty acids (F8), conjugated linoleic acids (F9), linoleic acid (F10), udder health (F11) and vaccelenic acid (F12). (Co)variance components were estimated for factor scores using a Bayesian linear animal model via Gibbs sampling. The animals were genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip v.2 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). A single marker regression model was fitted for GWAS analysis. The gene-set enrichment analysis was run on the GWAS results using the Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway databases to identify the ontologies and pathways associated with the FAF. Marginal posterior means of the heritabilities of the aforementioned FAF ranged from 0.048 for F12 to 0.310 for F5. Factors F1 and F6 had the highest number of relevant genetic correlations with the other traits. The genomic analysis detected a total of 39 significant SNP located on 17 Bos taurus autosomes. All latent variables produced signals except for F2 and F10. The traits with the highest number of significant associations were F11 (17) and F12 (7). Gene-set enrichment analyses identified significant pathways (false discovery rate 5%) for F3 and F7. In particular, systemic lupus erythematosus was enriched for F3, whereas the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway was overrepresented for F7. The results support the existence of important and exploitable genetic and genomic variation in these latent explanatory phenotypes. Information acquired might be exploited in selection programs and when designing further studies on the role of the putative candidate genes identified in the regulation of milk composition and udder health.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alessio Cecchinato"", ids = ""5793456""); list(name = ""NicolÃ² P P Macciotta"", ids = ""3717137""); list(name = ""M.

We conducted an epigenome-wide study to identify age-related methylation sites and examine their relationship to cancer and other underlying epigenetic marks. We analyzed 1006 blood DNA samples of women aged 35-76 years from the Sister Study and found that 7694 (28%) of the 27 578 CpGs assayed were associated with age (false discovery rate, q < 0.05). Using independent data sets, we confirmed 749 'high-confidence' age-related CpG (arCpGs) sites in normal blood. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas data, we show that these age-related changes are largely concordant in a broad variety of normal tissues and that a significantly higher (71-91%, P < 10(-74)) than expected proportion of increasingly methylated arCpGs (IM-arCpGs) were overmethylated in a wide variety of tumor types. IM-arCpGs sites occurred almost exclusively at CpG islands and were disproportionately marked with the repressive H3K27me3 histone modification (P < 1 Ã— 10(-) (50)). Genes containing these IM-arCpG sites were highly enriched for developmental and signaling pathways (P < 10(-) (10)). Our findings suggest that as cells acquire methylation at age-related sites, they have a lower threshold for malignant transformation that may explain in part the increase in cancer incidence with age.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Zongli Xu"", ids = ""3208590""); list(name = ""Jack A.

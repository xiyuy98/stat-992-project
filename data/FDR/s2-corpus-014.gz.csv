043868472dac28c39e1a2cb5b10d1d16ef04ab64,Insulin-like growth factor axis gene polymorphisms modify risk of pancreatic cancer.,"OBJECTIVE
Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-axis genes plays a critical role in cancer development and progression via their impact on the RAS/MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. We hypothesized that IGF-axis genetic variants modify individual susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.


METHODS
We retrospectively genotyped 41 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of 10 IGF-axis genes (IGF1, IGF2, IGF1R, IGF2R, IGFBP1, IGFBP3, IGFBP5, IRS1, IRS2, and IRS4) in 706 pancreatic cancer patients and 706 cancer-free controls using Sequenom and TaqMan technology. The association between genotype and pancreatic cancer risk was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression. A P value â‰¤.007 at a false discovery rate of 10% was set as the significance level.


RESULTS
We observed that the IGF1 *10212C>A and Ex4+2776G>A and IGF1R IVS2-70184A>G and IVS2+46329T>C variant genotypes were significantly associated with decreased pancreatic cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] range, 0.60-0.75) and that IGFBP1 Ex4+111A>G (I253M) was significantly associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk (OR=1.46) after adjusted for other risk factors and multiple comparisons (Pâ‰¤.007). IGF2R and IGFBP3 variant haplotypes were associated with increased and decreased pancreatic cancer risk, respectively (P<.001). We also observed a weak interaction of the IGF1R IVS2+46329T>C and IGF2R Ex45+11C>T (L2222L) genotypes with diabetes (P(interaction)=.05) and interaction of IGF2R and IRS1 genotypes with alcohol consumption (P(interaction)=.03 and .019, respectively) on increased pancreatic cancer risk.


CONCLUSION
These findings support our hypothesis that polymorphic variants of IGF-axis genes act alone or jointly with other risk factors to affect susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaoqun Dong"", ids = ""6327169""); list(name = ""Yanan Li"", ids = ""1691826""); list(name = ""Hongwei Tang"", ids = ""5545846""); list(name = ""Ping Hung Chang"", ids = ""145456214""); list(name = ""Kenneth R.

1ee0c28356c5bf80be6d21cda6c1278dea0308c5,Unraveling diversity in wheat competitive ability traits can improve integrated weed management,"Weed pressure can be high in organic and low-input farming and reduce yield and produce quality. In these systems, integrated weed management includes different agronomic practices but rarely focuses on the use of more competitive cultivars, which would reduce reliance on direct weed control methods and their detrimental effects on soil and the environment. We characterized 160 common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) accessions cultivated in Italy since the nineteenth century for four traits linked to competitive ability against weeds (above-ground biomass before stem elongation, tillering index, plant height, and flag leaf morphology) and for two production-related traits (grain yield and thousand-kernel weight). This approach aimed to identify the most suitable combinations of competitiveness and production traits, which often show trade-offs, and led to the identification of eight accessions with reduced grain yield to plant height trade-off. We genotyped the collection with SNP markers, revealing high molecular diversity and highlighting a trend of polymorphism loss passing from heritage to modern germplasm, with the presence of unique polymorphisms in both groups. These results underline the importance of studying both heritage and elite germplasm when focusing on traits that are not targeted by formal breeding, such as the competitive ability against weeds. Marker-trait associations (MTAs) with false discovery rates (FDR) <â€‰5% were detected for all traits studied, while MTAs with FDR <â€‰1% were detected for plant height, biomass, grain yield, and thousand-kernel weight. We identified MTAs confirming associations already reported in the literature as well as MTAs pinpointing new genomic regions that may disclose new breeding perspectives in common wheat. This study, for the first time, shows the high potential of interdisciplinary research bridging advanced genetic studies with agroecological approaches for selecting more competitive common wheat germplasm as additional tool in more sustainable integrated weed management systems.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Mariateresa Lazzaro"", ids = ""67160021""); list(name = ""Paolo BÃ rberi"", ids = ""6586780""); list(name = ""Matteo Dellâ\200\231Acqua"", ids = ""1400980042""); list(name = ""Mario Enrico PÃ¨"", ids = ""3837512""); list(name = ""Margherita Limonta"", ids = ""5239186""); list(name = ""Delfina Barabaschi"", ids = ""152262393""); list(name = ""Luigi Cattivelli"", ids = ""46599361""); list(name = ""Paolo Laino"", ids = ""3778741""); list(name = ""Patrizia Vaccino"", ids = ""4507597"")",,8e55eb6a4ef2244fee2fd97650ad99380cd5661a; 40f1d63c3a07b284b62306e2346818b880d61840; 175b3dcb3775a61938eb4c29809e9eeca04e83d3; 4c9d11e54620bbd2a592c7ac9a05c107f914243d; bd6e45caed04286a115e1a20a0f8bce30fc9c451; f1cc6dc3d6baf05a3137baae3162c2083001152f; 4c45d218d46801b7aa4978d54db9440841f564df; 10b57fbd17d6f25e52cbc6e0d24a1b29f6ef3b01; 30d76692e8426ba6538b2eaa6e91b655b19dda2a; 1c0dd4e56adf22b5d9640aa6b645ace9e1d47327; af91d563accc9cb7029f4733828ff4722247b471; b58a59dd87094b8dd359e18c8a12aa6ee364ed6c; 24ce540887bd94fcdcd545c88f1bd45002450fe4; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 37c1a87b575ddb5a5e6e8f4fcefba5db3bb07fe7; 46b535ccc1ccd3b440c5e2aede5361aa1dea2f56; 43dd3083aa0151db5fd5ef9ff19fde2b864f0569; 7079d87dd59531a4a9dd83e0c88fbc9d2840afed; 1eff6086e6255fc0263cf1f4072a61d4b1b93437; 72dfb536efd11d61527657744f39e14a4d03e35f; 23f56d7774fe614f5c215007fa40b29f98ae1067; 9832dba08657670c45e5c1d8864b8779741ac78e; 9f61d6daf10c99d691cb77bd134c3d6494a237bb; b947889f4f311d8db2dc2bd61d55551eac18c560; a97bff6da5cf28e964a38a1e27963d1bb404a848; df3229c418eb545d8250ea85084a57a4b60d13d4; ea715d17aed1ef77503f95102c9d1a87fa5514ba; 1700c428f71a8e65b51f6ff83671bb3269165be1; 3dcb00e44e9bf0a776af2a33ba6fcbb8616a49b2; 89a5073c844e6dc0dead2b5be2735a5881fdd0df; 8ba294f9c9a817baef77a020d978688ae8e18a26,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,39,1-11
09f654aa1d6b29cbabf21b2a5735ec2151292cfe,Signatures of Evolutionary Adaptation in Quantitative Trait Loci Influencing Trace Element Homeostasis in Liver,"Essential trace elements possess vital functions at molecular, cellular, and physiological levels in health and disease, and they are tightly regulated in the human body. In order to assess variability and potential adaptive evolution of trace element homeostasis, we quantified 18 trace elements in 150 liver samples, together with the expression levels of 90 genes and abundances of 40 proteins involved in their homeostasis. Additionally, we genotyped 169 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in the same sample set. We detected significant associations for 8 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL), 10 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), and 15 micronutrient quantitative trait loci (nutriQTL). Six of these exceeded the false discovery rate cutoff and were related to essential trace elements: 1) one pQTL for GPX2 (rs10133290); 2) two previously described eQTLs for HFE (rs12346) and SELO (rs4838862) expression; and 3) three nutriQTLs: The pathogenic C282Y mutation at HFE affecting iron (rs1800562), and two SNPs within several clustered metallothionein genes determining selenium concentration (rs1811322 and rs904773). Within the complete set of significant QTLs (which involved 30 SNPs and 20 gene regions), we identified 12 SNPs with extreme patterns of population differentiation (FST values in the top 5% percentile in at least one HapMap population pair) and significant evidence for selective sweeps involving QTLs at GPX1, SELENBP1, GPX3, SLC30A9, and SLC39A8. Overall, this detailed study of various molecular phenotypes illustrates the role of regulatory variants in explaining differences in trace element homeostasis among populations and in the human adaptive response to environmental pressures related to micronutrients.",2016,Biology;

d26528fa1000e8b80797fc028fdd00f7713c6af6,Plasma exosomal miRNAs-based prognosis in metastatic kidney cancer,"Plasma exosomal miRNAs were evaluated for prognosis in an initial set of 44 metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) patients by RNA sequencing. Among âˆ¼3.49 million mappable reads per patient, miRNAs accounted for 93.1% of the mapped RNAs. 227 miRNAs with high abundance were selected for survival analysis. Cox regression analysis identified association of 6 miRNAs with overall survival (OS) (P<0.01, False discovery rate (FDR) < 0.3). Five of the associated miRNAs were quantified in an independent follow-up cohort of 65 mRCC patients by TaqMan-based miRNA assays. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed the significant OS association of three miRs; miR-let-7i-5p (P=0.018, HR=0.49, 95% CI=0.21-0.84), miR-26a-1-3p (P=0.025, HR=0.43, 95% CI=0.10-0.84) and miR-615-3p (P=0.0007, HR=0.36, 95% CI=0.11-0.54). A multivariate analysis of miR-let-7i-5p with the clinical factor-based Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) score improved survival prediction from an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.58 for MSKCC score to an average AUC of 0.64 across 48-month follow-up time. The multivariate model was able to define a high-risk group with median survival of 14 months and low risk group of 39 months (P=0.0002, HR=3.43, 95%CI, 2.73-24.15). Further validation of miRNA-based prognostic biomarkers are needed to improve current clinic-pathologic based prognostic models in patients with mRCC.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Meijun Du"", ids = ""6149531""); list(name = ""Karthik V Giridhar"", ids = ""49448596""); list(name = ""Yijun Tian"", ids = ""6382752""); list(name = ""Michael R.

3430c978d3484cc18a115205dc4382920f3defb9,An empirical Bayes mixture method for effect size and false discovery rate estimation,"Many statistical problems involve data from thousands of parallel cases. Each case has some associated effect size, and most cases will have no effect. It is often important to estimate the effect size and the local or tail-area false discovery rate for each case. Most current methods do this separately, and most are designed for normal data. This paper uses an empirical Bayes mixture model approach to estimate both quantities together for exponential family data. The proposed method yields simple, interpretable models that can still be used nonparametrically. It can also estimate an empirical null and incorporate it fully into the model. The method outperforms existing effect size and false discovery rate estimation procedures in normal data simulations; it nearly acheives the Bayes error for effect size estimation. The method is implemented in an R package (mixfdr), freely available from CRAN.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Omkar Muralidharan"", ids = ""2726238"")",bab7d45203db902b0299a3e819d7107cb12a2a6e; fde12e0b207bcd0ee820f4645d63132458bafdbd; fb6d874baf578b0269859c4a86adb564c29dfd58; 44d86f3ba9167f4931dae729d814c13fbc7a0efb; 60bc813c5b7cea9ae0c586c1740993eb2acd51ca; baeea2d48a3ff9bd0702def492fe934ef6e4ab86; 90fc652fd86d8060e3bb694f7badcf5489ff56c9; 7656e7d76b51a42e5942f256eb7081e4f43bda86; 4bd46647b4dd58e8ea0878f6074b89ef63eba2d0; 2c7bc877184194406c757971ea12c602ccd7cf32; 9ee7c26a93bea2bd7b396af9f6f90cb688a58389; aecc3b421bf4aff3f1743a2f6cfc865203909474; 744fb6da70f74feffb48354f2a8e52fe5890e97c; 7a39b348314317807bc4127f7611d3aa0fafbee1; 2ab2422a4352eea430f33bf9ac4e3592e99f73f9; aba7347a07d20791d4b3ef2b30a3e8cb9ed3b883; e98b4f7d32da022b0c9eedadc42a6f28955f9206; d6b908628a6d859df434246dcfd0174411450bad; 919fa5c2da07fe442dd8188437b99a677fa47e3c; b8bd3db0e828a47236ff1b74f304ec7783dd340b; b66f88aa0454a1f7c1d1ebb7209cee3baec1b175; 4a27761b47c79dc1cece1bf24f0de2ce93cb3262; 23a29dce274309088d79bb50887b1c8f0a13b221; 69477494f6a1eccf3c2a838a5537867f1a381095; 3e52b68b6d34bc5d28144ad3ea8de5acfd5660b3; b4f9858e0c3239eedc2461af96d935cc5b501eb1; eaa666f83436eee490544f0bd23e134441cf12a3; bc0003eff7c1b6ccfd95d33758fc174b290122eb; fb8e49081eb6b60342af71c08d4d56a990fa001d; 782e670a0f152425551bc01158cfd30eb267df0b; 3d2c1e85198ce031ce707afdec8b1337ed9fca02; 035461e6ce90dcdafe5758911cc8a6e6f24f39e6; 0d12578ce288d36d850ed591aedbad77921382c6; 6799109a1fe8cb1ea77a974072d43527fc759cf3; 04498dd3b1c74945aa7bbe9e75bf89e8188dcccc; 4f857a7337feec224fe99a3f157414e05e56c37b; 8c0b503c2b5b3c931d3eab0eff160a402b627fd4; a5b9d79a85fba998199bf9403697d41cb83abb1d; ada480891541afe9d52d9f40e3efc23809789823; a819783cd203a543dcbc9e6c418e243019b0cb4c; 3b8ea78d3df177ccd4985a85441e393b344f3fa6; 5a8673585a74332b2351b8cdde7705d64fd0072d; 6c416103fca46c051ac0b93dad6181acf1309e1d; 4b0fc8d0a5cc1cc9d5fcda75deb56dd84e948d75; 43f09c00a5b81d7e54264c3b4ae7d889f820984d; b89708ee9a76638abca5b45782f491193d3b6e64; 39c8d284edc7796c54675bfcd984b944696c6d88; 8dde3d5a9612b76e9094b77238ba294c035d9d27; f5ea2e3b9aa3137cd31f16edd2795a97b0e8143c; 12586e21d54094470a2aa57452c72539a4fa79fe; 5eab93a2dba09a7ecbd22ca6fa232cd56a9d014e; c42c04bc285a65a8583d7491abbb0817b34bcf18; 2bf88b4904dae232d033dd7c7a2a4c75fa4c8ace; 0ae50e4b489a238db047884d58f25b38df9cf15a; 71aa29d0a878f90003418ef5f4fda2930d352e16; 08f39760b2ac922b0f67a27554f98480c4c7dc8e; 0cb392357cb3fe56f9989df325928bccf72b6a7d; 2b51f228cb47ef9de195aaff6c03fae3b41047f6; 3dda24e8ac0324e1b50be35b3c28b42766819fb0; d3d5d7ff34eec76e75d018b208437c4754acbf98; 8aa25a9e7592edf4ffaddd711fcbb27e5e080e8f; 26065684fccf25a8b179dfd0e17da80a62660023; 007d4501056b3fa218e08dcc1b2e5fb1647e7021,d51139172202e5a5e0000415571deaf2b1ac0b72; 2c0cdd08a8d3cb834da33515037eafa4bdb5faff; c1dc19f87fa83b4357f0557cbb6c32a4ee0002d7; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 2e4cbccb3467c9452a71c339d0d774235e294580; 2bde47cee0a40a3601a509500751982c4310e652; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; 2249ea630e56e4991aa157ad9aea65262efe4562; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; 16fe7e0d2d19b38a304200997431117be563b313; dc5c799d20933dc0d997801f9db104c4c3a2022d; 9393721879cae0d9becd88aa9392800ec71dd005; ac2ebdb7fc572b75f4f8a8afb6abd104bb9a233b; 0cb64a5dc4b4ebca3a3e1d3d50c4ae74ce7c5af2; bb3ec2eeb6714de0f3e3632e6dd44810afc193d5; 8cc9918add61ee5ef3b848aba9646169cc5e364e; 12e5939a80ec59f81214d7e729c577c350af9501; 4440efc12b63fd87c8e9336ea39ee35b33d8c1c7; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74,The Annals of Applied Statistics,4,422-438
fffd605edf0eaa51563dd6dd39ead4b750f367ee,"Serum Protein Abundance in Children with Sickle Cell Disease at Baseline, during Acute Pain Crisis, and on Hydroxyurea - Compared to Children with Other Pediatric Diseases","Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a multisystem disease, with substantial variation in presentation and clinical course. Many biomarkers have been described both during steady state and with complications, but comparison between SCD and other pediatric disease are lacking. In this prospective study we used a multiplex dual antibody sandwich immunoassay and compared the abundance of 103 serum proteins in 130 children with SCD, 51 morbidly obese children (BMI percentile > 99%), 29 children with inflammatory bowel disease at initial diagnosis, 186 children with pediatric solid tumors and 151 healthy controls. Serum samples of children with SCD were either taken at baseline (59 samples), on the day of admission for pain crisis (27 samples), or while adherent to hydroxyurea for at least 9 months (44 samples). For each set of 5 disease samples, 3 healthy control samples were selected that were matched by age, gender and race. Type of SCD, laboratory values and disease severity based on history of SCD complication were recorded. Methods: The relative concentration of 103 different serum proteins was measured with a customized quantibody array (Raybiotech, Inc.). Disease and control samples were processed in a random block design stratified by disease, sex, and age to minimize the effect of sample preparation and technician processing. The slides were developed with Alexa Flour 555- conjugated streptavidin and the signal was quantified using a laser scanner (GenePixÂ® 4000A, Molecular Devices Corporation). Measurements from the different PMT voltages were combined into a single composite scan, which was then background corrected and normalized by setting the mean of each array block to the global mean. A linear mixed effects model was constructed for each protein that included gender, race, and disease subgroups as fixed effects factors, with the sample (nested within subject) treated as a random factor. This model was fitted to each protein by restricted maximum likelihood using the lmer function in the R package lme4. Contrasts were constructed using the multcomp package to generate p-values for comparisons of interest. Within each comparison, the false discovery rate was controlled at 5% using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg. Results: S ixty-one serum proteins were significantly different between children with SCD and healthy subjects, 57 serum proteins between children with SCD and solid tumors, 38 serum proteins between children with SCD and obesity, and 14 serum proteins between children with SCD and inflammatory bowel disease. One-third of the serum proteins (19) were unique for SCD, as they were not significantly different from healthy children in any other of the pediatric diseases examined. Compared to serum of healthy children, 44 proteins were significantly different in children with severe SCD, 46 proteins in children with SCD suffering from an acute pain crisis, 45 proteins in children with SCD on hydroxyurea, and 42 proteins in children with clinically mild sickle cell disease (predominantly Hemoglobin SC disease). Surprisingly only one protein (CCL2) was significantly different between children with SCD at baseline and during an acute pain crisis. Hydroxyurea therapy only caused seven proteins to become significantly different from their pretreatment baseline; and only eight proteins were statistically different at a well baseline visit between children classified as having clinically mild versus severe disease. When compared to children with severe sickle cell disease, only 2 proteins (HGF and BDNF) were lower in both children with clinically mild SCD and in those taking hydroxyurea. Conclusion: Distinct SCD-specific abundance changes in serum proteins were identified compared to healthy controls and other pediatric disease. Perhaps most interestingly, the protein abundance profiles of the 103 studied proteins in pediatric SCD patients are almost identical between their baseline state and during an acute pain crisis; and minimal protein changes occurred in children with sickle cell disease who were stably taking hydroxyurea with an otherwise good laboratory response (increased MCV and Hgb F). Differences in serum protein abundance profiles could help distinguish mild from severe SCD and should be explored in larger studies.

Methods Participants were randomised to active (n=12) versus sham (n=13) DBS for 16â€…weeks. Data were analysed at the individual and group levels. Group differences were analysed using repeated measures ANOVAs. Relationships between depression severity and cognition were examined using partial correlations. The false discovery rate method controlled for multiple analyses. Results No significant interactions comparing active versus sham stimulation over time were evident. Change in depression was unrelated to change in neuropsychological measures. Twenty patients declined by â‰¥1 SD on at least one measure (41.3% of declines occurred in active group participants; 63.0% in older participants regardless of stimulation status). Twenty-two patients exhibited improvements >1 SD on neuropsychological measures (47.7% in the active group; 63.1% in younger participants). Conclusions These data suggest that VC/VS DBS in patients with TRD does not significantly affect neuropsychological function. Age at surgery, regardless of stimulation status, may be related to cognitive outcome at the individual patient level.

d6fbe3dc7ae2d43dd92936ea300da7c529b16f08,Altered resting-state thalamo-occipital functional connectivity is associated with cognition in isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.,"OBJECTIVE
Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) patients are at risk of cognitive impairments, however the underlying mechanism is still unclear. This study aimed to evaluate thalamo-cortical functional connectivity (FC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and its correlation with cognitive dysfunction in patients with iRBD.


METHODS
A total 37 polysomnographies (PSGs) confirmed iRBD patients and 15 age-sex matched controls underwent resting-state fMRI and comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Thalamo-cortical FC was evaluated by using seed-to voxel analysis and was compared between the iRBD and controls. Correlation between the average value of significant clusters and cognitive function scores in iRBD were calculated.


RESULTS
Compared to the control subjects, patients with iRBD patients showed cognitive decline in word list recognition (pÂ =Â 0.016), and constructional recall (pÂ =Â 0.044). The FC analysis showed increased FC between the left thalamus and occipital regions including the right cuneal cortex, left fusiform gyrus and lingual gyrus (cluster level pÂ <Â 0.05, corrected for false discovery rate). The averaged thalamo-fusiform FC value positively correlated with word list recognition after adjusting for age and sex (adjusted rÂ =Â 0.347, pÂ =Â 0.041).


CONCLUSION
Thalamic resting state FC is altered in iRBD patients and is associated with the cognitive function. Enhancement of the thalamo-occipital FC may reflect a compensatory mechanism for cognitive impairment in iRBD.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jung-Ick Byun"", ids = ""74923079""); list(name = ""Hyunwoo Kim"", ids = ""38297125""); list(name = ""Hye-jin Kang"", ids = ""6157777""); list(name = ""Kwang Su Cha"", ids = ""40638829""); list(name = ""J Sunwoo"", ids = ""79188758""); list(name = ""Jung-Won Shin"", ids = ""46936109""); list(name = ""Jangsup Moon"", ids = ""47478418""); list(name = ""Soon-Tae Lee"", ids = ""6479152""); list(name = ""Keun-Hwa Jung"", ids = ""145833345""); list(name = ""Kon Chu"", ids = ""145208477""); list(name = ""Manho Kim"", ids = ""2633938""); list(name = ""Won Woong Shin"", ids = ""7992758""); list(name = ""Dong Chae Lee"", ids = ""28362963""); list(name = ""Carlos H Schenck"", ids = ""3177035""); list(name = ""Sang Rim Lee"", ids = ""37889598""); list(name = ""Ki-Young Jung"", ids = ""2174454"")",,,Sleep medicine,69,"

We examined the feasibility of using gene expression changes in human prostate epithelium as a measure of response to a dietary intervention.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eight men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer were randomized to a low-fat/low-glycemic load intervention arm (<20% energy from fat and total daily glycemic load <100) or a ""standard American"" control arm (approximately 35% energy from fat and total daily glycemic load >200). Prostate tissue was collected before randomization and approximately 6 weeks later, at the time of radical prostatectomy. Epithelium was acquired by laser capture microdissection, and transcript abundance levels were measured by cDNA microarray hybridization and confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR.


RESULTS
Men in the intervention arm consumed 39% less total energy (P = 0.004) and the difference in weight change between intervention and control arms was -6.1 kg (P = 0.02). In the intervention arm, 23 (0.46%) of 5,711 cDNAs with measurable expression were significantly altered (P < 0.05; false discovery rate, <or=10%). In the control arm, there were no significant changes in transcript expression, even when using a false discovery rate as high as 50%.


CONCLUSIONS
A 6-week, low-fat/low-glycemic load diet was associated with significant gene expression changes in human prostate epithelium. These results show the feasibility of using prostate tissues collected at diagnosis and at surgery to study the effects of dietary manipulation on prostate tissue, which may give insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the associations of diet and obesity with the development or progression of prostate cancer.",2007,Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel W.

282913c470f30ad7db54eb5499c3a098457eac5e,18O proteomics reveal increased human apolipoprotein CIII in Hispanic HIV-1+ women with HAART that use cocaine.,"PURPOSE
Drug abuse is a major risk factor in the development and progression of HIV-1. This study defines the alterations in the plasma proteome of HIV-1-infected women that use cocaine.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Plasma samples from 12 HIV-seropositive Hispanic women under antiretroviral therapy were selected for this study. Six sample pairs were matched between nondrug users and cocaine users. After IgG and albumin depletion, SDS-PAGE, and in-gel digestion, peptides from nondrug users and cocaine users were labeled with (16) O and (18) O, respectively, and subjected to LC-MS/MS and quantitation using Proteome Discover and QuiXoT softwares and validated by ELISA.


RESULTS
A total of 1015 proteins were identified at 1% false discovery rates (FDR). Statistical analyses revealed 13 proteins with significant changes between the two groups, cocaine and noncocaine users (p < 0.05). The great majority pertained to protection defense function and the rest pertained to transport, homeostatic, regulation, and binding of ligands. Apolipoprotein CIII was increased in plasma of HIV+ Hispanic women positive for cocaine compared to HIV+ nondrug users (p â‰¤ 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Increased human apolipoprotein CIII warrants that these patients be carefully monitored to avoid the increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with HIV, HAART, and cocaine use.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Frances M.

e315426625933e9b8a140832936abcd8dd79b8c3,Interferon gene expression signature in rheumatoid arthritis neutrophils correlates with a good response to TNFi therapy.,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to use whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) of RA neutrophils to identify pre-therapy gene expression signatures that correlate with disease activity or response to TNF inhibitor (TNFi) therapy.


METHODS
Neutrophils were isolated from the venous blood of RA patients (n = 20) pre-TNFi therapy and from healthy controls (n = 6). RNA was poly(A) selected and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Reads were mapped to the human genome (hg19) using TopHat and differential expression analysis was carried out using edgeR (5% false discovery rate). Signalling pathway analysis was carried out using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. IFN signalling was confirmed by western blotting for phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Response to TNFi was measured at 12 weeks using change in the 28-item DAS (DAS28).


RESULTS
Pathway analysis with IPA predicted activation of IFN signalling in RA neutrophils, identifying 178 IFN-response genes regulated by IFN-Î±, IFN-Î² or IFN-Î³ (P < 0.01). IPA also predicted activation of STAT1, STAT2 and STAT3 transcription factors in RA neutrophils (P < 0.01), which was confirmed by western blotting. Expression of IFN-response genes was heterogeneous and patients could be categorized as IFN-high or IFN-low. Patients in the IFN-high group achieved a better response to TNFi therapy [Î”DAS28, P = 0.05, odds ratio (OR) 1.4 (95% CI 1.005, 1.950)] than patients in the IFN-low group. The level of expression of IFN-response genes (IFN score) predicted a good response [European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria] to TNFi using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (area under the curve 0.76).


CONCLUSION
IFN-response genes are significantly up-regulated in RA neutrophils compared with healthy controls.

d57f78a662fb634dc36496b39d4a5026caad9c6a,Multiscale Variance-Stabilizing Transform for Mixed-Poisson-Gaussian Processes and its Applications in Bioimaging,"Fluorescence microscopy images are contaminated by photon and readout noises, and hence can be described by mixed-Poisson-Gaussian (MPG) processes. In this paper, a new variance stabilizing transform (VST) is designed to convert a filtered MPG process into a near Gaussian process with a constant variance. This VST is then combined with the isotropic undecimated wavelet transform leading to a multiscale VST (MS-VST). We demonstrate the usefulness of MS-VST for image denoising and spot detection in fluorescence microscopy. In the first case, we detect significant Gaussianized wavelet coefficients under the control of a false discovery rate. A sparsity-driven iterative scheme is proposed to properly reconstruct the final estimate. In the second case, we show that the MS-VST can also lead to a fluorescent-spot detector, where the false positive rate of the detection in pure noise can be controlled. Experiments show that the MS-VST approach outperforms the generalized Anscombe transform in denoising, and that the detection scheme allows efficient spot extraction from complex background.",2007,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Bo Zhang"", ids = ""144639789""); list(name = ""Mohamed-Jalal Fadili"", ids = ""144812306""); list(name = ""Jean-Luc Starck"", ids = ""145394553""); list(name = ""Jean-Christophe Olivo-Marin"", ids = ""1448433796"")",ab12f85ebdf758579653d91e30e4fecbb6f08d05; d2cb4b25f31613a057cacfeea245e7e3a83ea4cb; ba7541ebe003f821ddc2e352b2d4c6d75bc85404; c9a16ec8e257ebfcd512346baeeaf2a104e0c027; 8f37c0c0a38223f99766d8d440407da1fd1e3189; bb8762099d88eb51892cc74785cdbb16add5f102; 01368cb7d764292a8006c2fb5bcf75a43ce240d2; 7d5ad1cacaf38b2ab8ff1eb35b89c3d122298058; 649ffad94dd71045cdbae1c86481d02e5063ba60; 88f6f53742c352228bcee38bfe149caef719a203; cef91941dec20edfa0a23006665a7ad9cd9ca289; 9f614f929afeab792e5a53fd27ca15c387545ef6; cfe370a9c676938b64df99782806ed108bf49c3e; baf5b7d8e89c0bc2d85ed7b89ffc21017f2e0b66; 28431102c63b30ce655dadf60a243ed34c106c05; 88e8a3937c32773c5ce9782cad04632693c6d7fb; be86ca79ced29f27ab49f3975cadc294deb682e6; 32871b45861161e7f87f03c30c72a82918cf652e; 9b3b595fbb065a4dd14f1cb759576a4019adeed1; f7e83993e26e921fb63977c3864f1e6a387b91f5; 900b972a427dfe4ac8e84cd7d689fff4f9070255; b6e8fa0b08a8ebd8008e12443c12fb1e11fa1c4b; 00edbb10589843dff684b5e5b38066873ce17222; 5d2049e5cc3908977e7fc0bc8f57f5c326da04ed; c1557d2c5d156883c46fe24f1bae15ef3f200300; 5136c28493c6cc15a61c4a6aa45b834494935b39; 8d109b110ad785988f7b40079a3cda0b515ce1a4; d420095ebc8c1402f19ea4943f7b4cd62b03aea9; 2be5c509e9b9d03432574f69608ee409a327c84b; f9f265b633ebbae9138154bdfa668d08a84dca7b; c027eb8ad71673500ac52b0af107e78f21f31406; d622b6ffd2eca9d9873afa4375d4d14b7442701a; c090142af6de44c842985b6ddbde5b1acdfb902c; 56134a084be9ebcbdd9bf83da27fd2d02282db28; bc58c57de00a855e2ac8d0275b1f9b5a329df9bc; 04d7a5090eef5df90d9963301fe3a08bfed64db5; 1197e1c8b0405d22f68958349f8d867709226a35; c9ede11f6a436b8e3d81ee45b8476520feb5ab07; 299618bb46298f67438b07788a77f666b6263b96; 8749b33a60d74ab7647093b35ac5bd1177077742; 0efbf4647f7a55ce779a3351ad46d06b640b8863; 39babbcbdcf8e08f3f3ada75653ba9449a787e21; 328de6cbabde1ca7008b3a8cdea11e9d914f8509; 3b9c5ce679b9211b24c4fbbf1188704d967887da; fa9b03706ddbca2fdac1fbe082df1f5da83e9b2d; a9e7c6e118fb56ea07ac69b0ca6a96ce89182603; 6ea6b99d8ec56ba93f7763904050f70d675101da; 3e14474b587f1eccf2e8e420108879ae4058fc77; 0323023c60b7da19896ea6c7d0ccf19c8213a83e; ea1b716a9ef69e496ccaf93410429f81976abde3; 1e800db12f98c810efca0b00cce1ed49bb3b0118; d5d490bb0d73c34fa034a27fbf99a1de23e0b14c; d986a985f093614e70451abd84335b3974ee1685; 47ef3ae55ff7d7d3d408ff575a14db8667bc32a5; 8aacfaca72a1b7ee9e184628196dc6565030cea1; f7ee84f11921476c58acccf6ee11dbbeb8777e40; 16199ac51b5df209fc80fa1f2c0af73d8e802d2c; 46966e0128e46f477d29177a97af673be93ecc59; 8bec88685420963e09a06f7ee50c195819a6b4b1; 8140b31a51ca8fe86d5325ae6146a3c6058e671b; 89afd46c97554d7f73e8b374381e5bc19ec69a73; 4474e1b25d7afea099cc7c9b53dd3d627893750f; 97109d064d8b5a4ef63067af89149ef0d894ac50; 942f73855ecaf8df261118a792b2a27a495d7808; 69284daf03be838409b2a7ba898a97b16fd9fd61; c1ae3293a7a88ff9bfe4e85998189335140289e8; fe2dcce50a78b8267494f257697a894cd6b28076; a41f27d8e064317fd0006cbf61e2f61789454343; cebaa4dc9a23317c8857c1561d86360cbe2911d3; 7dc3e21b840d7279bd5b221fd5558223f72b283d; f482902273013f4985bd4754d7decd4c95842c65,17e7cca7e795d8ba1fa9d2c88bf2675c2d6ddfe8; 9bb139a8ffd832645321790e33cc9297c7077f87; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 31977e398608f12086567243f2b3d1d226d3195a; 0033dcf356c18725873a47f692e1912709c41714; 3a69503cfe3b4f08491c6aea90af420ec90a9b5e; 9f9646250b617455ee9cbf0884bb6f9ec5598b23; 2348bdeeb2f81783c87db85d96d59f01a125377d,2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing,6,VI - 233-VI - 236

A custom sheep whole-transcriptome microarray, with more than 23,000 unique transcripts, was designed and then used to profile the global gene expression of sheep after feeding a high dietary supplementation of organic Se. Lactating crossbred ewes ( = 10; 3 to 4 yr of age and 55 to 65 kg BW) at late lactation (100 Â± 8 d in milk) were acclimated to indoor individual pen feeding of a basal control diet (0.40 mg Se/d, sodium selenite) for 4 wk. Sheep were then kept on a diet with an extra (high) supplementation of organic Se (1.45 mg Se/d as Sel-Plex; Alltech Biotechnology Pty Ltd, Dandenong, Victoria, Australia) for 40 d. Whole blood was collected at 2 time points (last day of the acclimatization period [T0] and after 40 d of the organic Se supplementation [T40]), and then total RNA was isolated and labeled for the subsequent microarray analysis. Significance Analysis of Microarrays, using the -statistic, of the microarray data (T40 versus T0) evidenced the up- and downregulation of 942 and 244 transcripts (false discovery rate < 0.05), respectively. Seven genes showed the same trend of expression (up- or downregulation) when tested by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in a cross-validation step. The microarray showed significant upregulation of the following selenoproteins at T40: selenium binding protein 1 (SELENBP1), selenoprotein W1 (SEPW1), glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), and septin 8 (SEPT8). And the expression trends for SEPW1 and SEPT8 were validated using qPCR. Functional annotation of the differentially expressed genes showed the enrichment of several immune system-related biological processes (lymphocyte activation, cytokine binding, leukocyte activation, T cell differentiation, and B cell activation) and pathways (cytokine and interleukin signaling). Moreover, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis evidenced the enrichment of B and T cell receptors signaling pathways, with an enrichment score of 0.63 and 0.59, respectively. Overall, from a global gene expression (whole-transcriptome) point of view, short-term supplementation of a high dietary organic Se to Se-nondeficient sheep results in a transcriptomic signature that mainly reflects an induced immune system and a modulation of transcription effect. Also, the present study provides a custom whole-transcriptome microarray platform that can be used in further global gene expression studies in the ovine species.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ramy Elgendy"", ids = ""4083297""); list(name = ""Mery Giantin"", ids = ""4814949""); list(name = ""Federica Castellani"", ids = ""50647372""); list(name = ""Lisa Grotta"", ids = ""49745130""); list(name = ""Fabiana Palazzo"", ids = ""46850477""); list(name = ""Mauro Dacasto"", ids = ""3838842""); list(name = ""Giuseppina Di Martino"", ids = ""36857475"")",efe4cc93e3c196e2362af0d9540bbfb05f4878e0; f0d897a20146a26b582b41cee830426e91973f11; 8781ff606a5deae82e1660201d7478c34e3d7191; 42b2681a8965b8c367f94f407c9ed87aa91034bf; 82a3e5f718d9925b69d777591975afb850b69164; da1bed048cfb4d9831050718b8ac2dac2401ad76; ba9e1b2281dd6eacd050207fa9393759d272dcc6; fb1abe5a108445aebc8ede32c7663007bd05b365; bf354d19771cc3be9588a0a881c0945e798ad906,c6ec9e5853b785e86bb09ccf29e261a7209bf8c9; fc49f7f7095239c8e6db737cb9a5ecb54a9b144c; c9687950884b3380d6867b567bce2ca63abe5a91; 529d55209fa041c2eeb8cd85db26ccfa416719d4; 04eaa03dc670afa88c9f3c83fc8da08ef4d31cdd; 63f27b05f53556a68c933300198fd8dda1395c0d; b61d43cfab5980410bd62bc68c62d05415bafb12; fc76bf34ed8686e4b4475ae674dbd0257f951e4d; fc720ff6c01019228c300bce47fdf140ea89e29f; a2c5b75f7bcfdd75e8a73e424912d53de84918a0; b543441f851d613e08bc397b7308ec87eb799ef3; 9f6eacbf256d9e26cf4f1c39f80405ca3d01d5a7; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; dbe0eaa79df2200e6875317b31ae0cdccb045f3d; e054ab0378b5fd16c87bf8dcf9ca1a7b6911528a; e2be827e02b2e02191783219e29209366ba62d91; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 5c142859d87512172274aad5bd2fbf52dec6119f; 0b2cabaeab57ace855bb19cee37fcfbdd7eaf5f7; f85f7df7c965405f30e89e68cd4dcf85ff39021c; cb0d4f45ebef542bdacee94865a7bbc471ea6a38; 251e40a3502ff24f7b1ccdba4d8e50f7b3472727; 22153b0771976b93d9c293b0b7926700d09b662c,Journal of animal science,94 8,"

SBL takes advantage of the sparsity of link-level parameters and implements Bayesâ€™ rule based on the Gaussian Prior. Through the proposed scheme, most linksâ€™ metric values are regarded as zero while the significant ones are identified. Therefore, it is especially useful when our goal is to locate the congested links.

e544ba08cafbbdd80d26eeb3a78c0faead645deb,Early pregnancy metabolite profiling discovers a potential biomarker for the subsequent development of gestational diabetes mellitus,"Current early pregnancy screening tools to identify women at risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus lack both specificity and sensitivity. As a result, the foetus and mother are often subjected to insult during disease progression, prior to diagnosis and treatment in later pregnancy. Metabolomics is an analytical approach, which allows for appraisal of small molecular mass com- pounds in a biofluid. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the relationship between the early gesta- tion serum metabolite profile and the subsequent develop- ment of gestational diabetes mellitus in the search for early pregnancy biomarkers and potential metabolic mechanisms. Our nested case-control study analysed maternal serum at 20 weeks' gestation, obtained from the New Zealand cohort of the Screening for Pregnancy End- points study. Metabolomic profiling was performed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, and metabolites were identified using R software and an in- house mass spectral library. Statistical analysis was per- formed using SPSS version 21.0. Forty-eight metabolites were identified in the serum samples. Itaconic acid (P = 0.0003), with a false discovery rate of 0.012, was found to be significantly more abundant in women who subsequently developed gestational diabetes mellitus, when compared to controls with uncomplicated pregnancies. The current pilot study found that itaconic acid may have potential as a novel biomarker in early pregnancy to predict the subsequent development of gestational diabetes melli- tus. However, the findings from this pilot study require validation with a larger, diverse population before trans- lation into the clinical setting.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""S.

b289a4d7b4b3766a9037a60134851af3af9490ea,Protein significance analysis in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) measurements.,"Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is a targeted mass spectrometry technique that provides sensitive and accurate protein detection and quantification in complex biological mixtures. Statistical and computational tools are essential for the design and analysis of SRM experiments, particularly in studies with large sample throughput. Currently, most such tools focus on the selection of optimized transitions and on processing signals from SRM assays. Little attention is devoted to protein significance analysis, which combines the quantitative measurements for a protein across isotopic labels, peptides, charge states, transitions, samples, and conditions, and detects proteins that change in abundance between conditions while controlling the false discovery rate. We propose a statistical modeling framework for protein significance analysis. It is based on linear mixed-effects models and is applicable to most experimental designs for both isotope label-based and label-free SRM workflows. We illustrate the utility of the framework in two studies: one with a group comparison experimental design and the other with a time course experimental design. We further verify the accuracy of the framework in two controlled data sets, one from the NCI-CPTAC reproducibility investigation and the other from an in-house spike-in study. The proposed framework is sensitive and specific, produces accurate results in broad experimental circumstances, and helps to optimally design future SRM experiments.

581648ddbe56139159ad858239e8e80e397b808b,Eclecticism in cladistics: Convergence among opposing optimality criteria may be a hoax,"Currently, most authors gave up on justifying the choice of a single optimality criterion in phylogenetics. Instead, they frequently apply as many methods as feasible as an unofficial means to tackle the question of the uncertainty inherent to tree reconstruction. For example, we reviewed recent volumes of the journal Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution (volumes 94â€“115) and observed that 311 of 545 articles used this informal strategy (i.e., more than one method). However, only two articles attempted to justify this approach, both stating that convergence provides some measure of robustness. Neither offered any references or supporting evidence for that claim. This should not be surprising since older but similar reviews have noticed a comparable pattern. Nevertheless, we interpret this pattern differently. While others have asserted that the frequent convergence in the literature (which in our case is reported in 295 of 311 publications) is an indication of the futility of comparing methods, we hypothesize it could be an indication of publication bias. Using 117 empirical cladograms, we simulated nine alignments per tree and performed 100 tree search experiments per dataset using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and posterior probability. We designed alignment simulations to improve the retention index in comparison to the original matrix and facilitate convergency. Still, the vast majority of results were divergent by measures of the match-split distance of unrooted binary trees. These results suggest that convergency may be rare and that it is a poor indicator of the distance between the results and the original tree. Furthermore, we analyzed our data under the light of Bayesian theory to argue that the comparison of opposing optimality criteria can, at least under certain experimental conditions, increase the false discovery rate in phylogenetics.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Larry JimÃ©nez-Ferbans"", ids = ""1413699730""); list(name = ""Denis Machado"", ids = ""145803416""); list(name = ""Gabriel Massami Izumi de Freitas"", ids = ""1411278637"")",,,,,
38cedffb41f2434a89c42d5b77755a461964b5e9,A95: The Risk of Dyslipidemia in Pediatric Arthritis Patients Is Similar to That of Adult Patients With Arthritis,"Background/Purpose: 
 
Patients with autoimmune diseases run a higher risk for dyslipidemia due to chronic inflammatory processes and immune dysregulation. This phenomenon has been recognized to a certain extent in adult arthritis patients but has not been previously explored in pediatric arthritis patients. The objective of this study is to compare the frequency of dyslipidemia in children with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA), children with Non-Specific Arthritis (NOSA), adults with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), and adults with Osteoarthritis (OA). Determining differences amongst these groups is important in understanding the connection between arthritis and dyslipidemia risk, especially in the pediatric population. 
 
 
 
Methods: 
 
After IRB approval, patient's in this retrospective data base study were gathered from chart review of consecutive patient's with JRA, NOSA, RA, and OA who presented to the pediatric rheumatology and adult rheumatology clinics at an academic center. Outcomes of interest that were compared included total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG), cholesterol: HDL ratio, non-HDL, and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Other demographic information compared included patient age, sex, and use of biologic DMARD. Comparisons between groups were made using the Fisher's Exact Test and multiple testing adjustments were made by controlling for the False Discovery Rate. 
 
 
 
Results: 
 
There were 32 pediatric patients (40.6% male) ranging from age 2â€“17 (median 11 years). Out of 32 pediatric patients, 22 had JRA and 10 had non- specific arthritis (NOSA). Furthermore, there were 82 adult patient's (18.3% male) ranging from age 30â€“85 (median 63 years). Out of these, 49 had diagnosis of RA while 33 had diagnosis of OA. In the pediatric cohort, more JRA patients than NOSA had abnormal LDL values (68.2% and 0.0%, p value = 0.005) and non-HDL values (50.0% and 0.0%, p value = 0.05). Other lipid parameters were not significantly different. Between the pediatric cohort and adult cohort, the pediatric cohort had greater percentages of abnormal LDL (46.9% and 19.5%, p value = 0.05), TG (93.8% and 24.4%, p value <0.001), and VLDL (62.5% and 15.9%, p value <0.001). No significant difference in lipid parameters between patients with RA and OA. There was also no significant difference in lipid parameters between those with or without RF/CCP positivity, male sex, or biologic DMARD use. 
 
 
 
Conclusion: 
 
Pediatric JRA patients were more likely to have an abnormal lipid panel, specifically LDL and nonâ€“HDL, as compared to NOSA patients. Interestingly, pediatric patients had higher rates of abnormal LDL, triglycerides, and VLDL. This suggests that the concern for dyslipidemia in the adult population should also be shown to pediatric patients with JRA. Additional studies are needed to determine whether modification of cardiovascular risk in pediatric patients with chronic inflammatory disease is beneficial in preventing clinically significant premature atherosclerosis.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Timothy Hayes"", ids = ""39180685""); list(name = ""Anjali Patwardhan"", ids = ""47314750"")",,,Arthritis & Rheumatism,66,
dc056dc4d0a73dd3a9f9779dccda3f0b72125de7,iFASP: combining isobaric mass tagging with filter-aided sample preparation.,"Careful, clean and controlled preparation of samples for mass spectrometry proteomics is crucial to obtain reproducible and reliable data. This is especially important when carrying out quantitative proteomics by chemical isobaric labeling (aka tandem mass tagging), since the differentially labeled samples are combined quite late during the sample processing. Addressing this need for robust and reliable sample processing for quantitative proteomics, we describe here iFASP, a simple protocol for combining isobaric mass tagging with the recently introduced filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) method. iFASP provides a quick, simple and effective method for obtaining clean samples, ensuring efficient digestion and providing excellent labeling yields for quantitative proteomics experiments. We have carried out our iFASP protocol using several highly complex Xenopus laevis egg and embryo lysates and compared the labeling yields and number of high-confidence peptide identifications to a standard in-solution digestion and labeling protocol. Although the labeling efficiency with both techniques is in the 99+% range, the number of peptides identified with a 1% false discovery rate and the corresponding number of quantified peptide spectral matches are as much as doubled with iFASP compared to the corresponding non-FASP-based method.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gary S.

c35d84a5dfaac4d6c3f1624b58696f73b3537818,Serum proteomic pro fi les of depressive subtypes,"Depression is a highly heterogeneous disorder. Accumulating evidence suggests biological and genetic differences between subtypes of depression that are homogeneous in symptom presentation. We aimed to evaluate differences in serum protein profiles between persons with atypical and melancholic depressive subtypes, and compare these profiles with serum protein levels of healthy controls. We used the baseline data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety on 414 controls, 231 persons with a melancholic depressive subtype and 128 persons with an atypical depressive subtype for whom the proteomic data were available. Depressive subtypes were previously established using a data-driven analysis, and 171 serum proteins were measured on a multi-analyte profiling platform. Linear regression models were adjusted for several covariates and corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate q-values. We observed differences in analytes between the atypical and melancholic subtypes (9 analytes, qo0.05) and between atypical depression and controls (23 analytes, qo0.05). Eight of the nine markers differing between the atypical and melancholic subtype overlapped with markers from the comparison between atypical subtype and controls (mesothelin, leptin, IGFBP1, IGFBP2, FABPa, insulin, C3 and B2M), and were mainly involved in cellular communication and signal transduction, and immune response. No markers differed significantly between the melancholic subtype and controls. To conclude, although some uncertainties exist in our results as a result of missing data imputation and lack of proteomic replication samples, many of the identified analytes are inflammatory or metabolic markers, which supports the notion of atypical depression as a syndrome characterized by metabolic disturbances and inflammation, and underline the importance and relevance of subtypes of depression in biological and genetic research, and potentially in the treatment of depression.",2016,,"list(name = ""Femke Lamers"", ids = ""2361959""); list(name = ""Mariska Bot"", ids = ""5454447""); list(name = ""Rick Jansen"", ids = ""145625746""); list(name = ""Mk Chan"", ids = ""80585865""); list(name = ""Jd Cooper"", ids = ""81295678""); list(name = ""Sabine Bahn"", ids = ""1713917""); list(name = ""Bwjh Penninx"", ids = ""75137313"")",,7a70ccf868aa41633b43ebc7cc244c29457a1c8a; 4c7103ae80e59e9ea690438c094da3e79067f72f; 7cd2a50b1c3b6288104221aad5fd75235147d570; 10876223623ba70b175fa895fd1bddeebb7ec1ef; f6bfed799b53c8aa2ff373b0bf3056d310e8cbc2; c0621155006e26f64f6f700c8778442efcde4c30; 4321831edb42e8e81c814cdcd88fa29fada53bae; 6a2706f928eaadb4544341b9185b8fa40bbcb447; a07596bb687dcab45f3da5e1137fb95c00f2fa6c; 65689405fabb4606a8fe0ef543ca9b70b1284c0a; 1de8aa73d9892f2f0c0709b61976ebe9ba57fb7c; f449bffc1911b3b1fe0ad3f08841fad85e92ec9f; 3394cb54ee4c23cb1eb7e8df479e220a07f33002; 18d1e52aa55affcdc573d9cb7adb759e72800b1e; f3b3d135ced1b591fe9105adc41e3a674250c740; 0fece555e5c60891dd599f6ba4675fea52068ca2; 5d9897077fb63dcb109449928f3bfa223286cdbd; 93be2586bf392d0c83b5820fe88afca5129aaac8; 073f7c0edddb4506f919802bcf99c2bbda2cc816; ca0353dea9d522b6e0a8d759bfa6600f92b078e9; 8c7137c966d6eff805ffea72680c8dd58299dfbe; 9e9fb133e7c2441e053c50faae370dcb7043b501; 2dbe2afbfe2076004246578b8ad969488b508d30; 8f003b03506f1983be811172b317fe405f5c8a2c; 00f5e1204413545102eea0b2904b80e75ccee8c4; 77c576378ed642f15100106c95b044994e15c62c; ac750f3f13720479759b978a974e89ff5c273a8f; ff99ec023be34134a31dcfdf81ec8639dc46a35b; 13ab8ce98ed5cd9d76b34d2d13656b4acf3209d8; e4adf087d2e5ced0ad7995643d7dfec55b4bb3bd; 96d2538b49116a892df3de42ef5d4db340350f25; fa493009746fbe3b0ef3140dc56a7029a2ab351d; bddda9445f285cea63e72caa8757d717a4f0828f; aa247ded6903fb0c3dc6490a8811a91e8eafe156; 427eaafcd47b3abc620b953ff021f25925ff0e62; c0ef3d22e5a16127009f9cd12bac325167ffe1f3; ccbb4f90b2c285c4c7765de0bcf183eb390c752f; c7b34916a4ede96aa7844c38ab35bad433224063; 34a7f562e55f7dbe6d4fa24e1ea7e687a50e7c3a; b116df6865bc866c800573750335fc5c9add9439; 3e985996b82395235623fc1d10313d053a449feb; 07784d2b4c00c1663bdae244c9a40b0c241f31c4; dc5e2eb05bfcbf0aa8e52763b8130f87b2f5b74f; 57412c6220e44ce8eb9ba95e0a8fd00152ed71bf; 43721b84aea6652087c901b6ff03e8dcc494b900; 7c954d0ebc913b7ff1ca6167d5a34337fc1f268b; c8ad16d2d0fdb2130f852d928b1e6a8a442c1f48; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 975d5eca03a2cadedd38045300c24b386b8eb33f; 04c60d39fcaf20a7ee393c91def9fcd0fd3f10fc; 20ad7c39b49fa6d5bbe3604aaf54a8cc938130dd; 6af45be3be408ebc46808f13e6116f31b31c8009; 80ff39953420f07da3baa6a9913f7e6830cb6c4e; 8363a355f8eed66ff41b2a8f6abb96bfa54b11d0; 9f592d975c5e80d8c6307ff82ba7277c9eda3e0b; 0eb2cb01000760066abb0e8a85764e442fe49593; 3b2f0d0116e1d27300aa5568627887ee531b9a5e; 7a5daa88d200ffc5d1d986f54c1ace30938b13d3; f0e420b57065da2d189288925ec044323bafa26a; c805f4092d9038b23e05a5730433bb9ba593da72; 0344460d712cbd972db56739f9114dea6dbb921b; 86736fd120a0e1783cf3e5efaa8784762c1cfcec; 159670545563cd9366abed487314f2c47957e032; e72720db247cafb40d8bd7b0d5cc9b6cb629b642; e80552db22ca1958348d24aa9f96f0559d7ab7db; bf76dc5953b584812a4708c49026cfcf56c96acb; 222786c52e7bb866a929fc66d7655b3f8f9100cb; af1f0763250b45f2c19c7d0de1d331d8d0671766; 563e0d5169526cf35db11d84ab91c2da01630a22,,,
1025b1271c0131cd82d926e570c6393bf293f65f,A method for modifying multiple testing procedures,"Abstract Many recent multiple testing papers have provided more efficient and/or robust methodology for control of a particular error rate. However, different multiple testing scenarios call for the control of different error rates. Hence, the procedure possessing the desired optimality and/or robustness properties may not be applicable to the problem at hand. This paper provides a general method for extending any multiple testing procedure to control any error rate, thereby allowing for the procedure possessing the desired properties to be used to control the most relevant error rate. As an example, two popular procedures that were originally designed to control the marginal and positive False Discovery Rate are extended to control the False Discovery Rate and Family-wise Error Rate. It is shown that optimality and/or robustness properties of the original procedure are retained when it is modified using the proposed method.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Joshua D.

e6b33cb06dff00c8c8c7b0062ef958a98b884372,Administration of tomato and paprika beverages modifies hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in mice: a DNA microarray analysis.,"To examine whether the expression of hepatic genes, including biomarkers, is affected by the ingestion of tomato or paprika, mice were given tomato beverage (TB), paprika beverage (PB), or water (control) ad libitum for 6 weeks. The body weights in the TB and PB groups were significantly lower than those in the control group. Administration of PB significantly increased the plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level. Hepatic gene expression was investigated using DNA microarrays. The ingestion of TB or PB up-regulated the expression of 687 and 1045 genes and down-regulated the expression of 841 and 653 genes, respectively (false discovery rate<0.05). These changes in gene expression suggest that TB ingestion promotes glycogen accumulation and stimulates some specific steps in fatty acid oxidation. PB ingestion promoted the entire glucose and fatty acid metabolic pathways to improve lipid profiles. These results provide useful genetic information about a variety of biochemical processes by which vegetables can contribute to good health.",2009,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Koichi Aizawa"", ids = ""10762464""); list(name = ""Toshihiro Matsumoto"", ids = ""47428390""); list(name = ""Takahiro Inakuma"", ids = ""5967830""); list(name = ""Tomoko Ishijima"", ids = ""35032523""); list(name = ""Yuji Nakai"", ids = ""2359288""); list(name = ""Keiko Abe"", ids = ""1699047""); list(name = ""Fumio Amano"", ids = ""46914433"")",b5e7417bb12b99718cd97aa54609ffd4a28ebde4; 55b7de1a0742208985a81747dfd929b9d6db2f29; 2d664ba290cfa1da2286c85c203a6c26b28ec14e; dfcd81e701716b2b7a15f3967ddceb31ac30a378; c1b555f284a4fdffbc8713043a33229c11c8563a; b47f094c9ed241a67aa16961be5232f000005264; d1414f66728f0fbcdf05a5c386004dbebb711651; 1920696f7301dfc74cad0179a4085b3b042d1492,,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,57 22,"

a4ec5cbb855b0e8e1f9ae66235e8423b8df33ece,High resolution metabolomics to discriminate compounds in serum of male lung cancer patients in South Korea,"BackgroundThe cancer death rate escalated during 20th century. In South Korea, lung cancer is expected to contribute 12,736 deaths in men, the highest amount among all cancers. Several risk factors may increase the chance to acquiring lung cancer, with mostly related to exogenous compounds found in cigarette smoke and synthetic manufacturing materials. As the mortality rate of lung cancer increases, deeper understanding is necessary to explore risk factors that may lead to this malignancy. In this regard, this study aims to apply high resolution metabolomics (HRM) using LC-MS to detect significant compounds that might contribute in inducing lung cancer and find the correlation of these compounds to the subjectsâ€™ smoking habit.MethodsThe comparison was made between healthy control and lung cancer groups for metabolic differences. Further analyses to determine if these differences are related to tobacco-induced lung cancer (past-smoker control vs. past-smoker lung cancer patients (LCPs) and non-smoker control vs. current-smoker LCPs) were selected. The univariate analysis was performed, including a false discovery rate (FDR) of qâ€‰=â€‰0.05, to determine the significant metabolites between the analyses. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) was done to discriminate metabolites between the control and case subjects. Selected compounds based on significant m/z features of human serum then experienced MS/MS examination, showing that for many m/z, the patterns of ion dissociation matched with standards. Then, the significant metabolites were identified using Metlin database and features were mapped on the human metabolic pathway mapping tool of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).ResultsUsing metabolomics-wide association studies, metabolic changes were observed among control group and lung cancer patients. Bisphenol A (211.11, [Mâ€‰+â€‰H-H2O]+), retinol (287.23, [Mâ€‰+â€‰H]+) and L-proline (116.07, [Mâ€‰+â€‰H]+) were among the significant compounds found to have contributed in the discrimination between these groups, suggesting that these compounds might be related in the development of lung cancer. Retinol has been seen to have a correlation with smoking while both bisphenol A and L-proline were found to be unrelated.ConclusionsTwo potential biomarkers, retinol and L-proline, were identified and these findings may create opportunities for the development of new lung cancer diagnostic tools.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Aryo Dimas Pamungkas"", ids = ""6455109""); list(name = ""Changyoung Park"", ids = ""4029803""); list(name = ""Sungyong Lee"", ids = ""70412752""); list(name = ""Sun Ha Jee"", ids = ""2043510""); list(name = ""Youngja Hwang Park"", ids = ""46797022"")",518041584a07cf5eae13151ed01b3ee8a9e14d63; 6da5c55cfdd9beb128a3d4419b3826425d8d3df9; 8420cbcbb6b9cbb43ccf36d5fe092bcce327fbf8; 88002dd5e7c0f6b87df92c8c1c11f5dce50ed8a1; 8a222e915fa64edc44a35b65ef7ab639cd36a487,3989db8000359697c3528ba6cc6216decc98c1f8; f36428cf6d0a9392041b4e397d2a408d21138367; 4c1a68d7f460654eca9255571a8ebe1070684238; 162f869aca574585e64338fe57416be976ce3ff3; 81182d203f323ea8abd4b515c591819ca1c34b16; 16c67bae2cd7902711d701cabfc485d0e80e7bc5; 4d97a42fbdb80f74f9fe754b1a3eff4b69735a32; 2649d9983986d2b19dc94e360f7e5733888d54eb; 3ee94480e65bfb4e95f5e2eb7fa6c8024c1519f8; 16577f1d9d1d423ed05d026a677a51a42522e77b; fb10e3630028d657acc936bba497235dd1044086; 07c3e8d164dbb18d688507a0c88daeaa4a3b66c6; 523b6246febf860709411adb121e9771afec72f8; 55557c0ebc71ff48881ef0c8531fc1bea4c28b5c; 27b0fa6174ae3c4262b813288fb94262ffb67803; ff3918e09bf0369492ac5201404f6ad1754d13ba; 5a6976b2639fd079d2c982c891d96eb7c56a2a13; 8c59ef925fd199e2402b893d05bd08689e638dab; 9865f6cd19a0231c58bb26b5f9f783c5106dc940; cbea0537f640254131ab129fc1bb9899d626735d; b89e381451b402661c87cf5dd0aaa2b0cddd058d; 2a846fbce84f8fa04f2f1a1b539f59c2047510ea; 407de899a3159cc7c1ab5ac046839634d8bf165b; 3dd16d84011d69f8200d8c90dadffe15b4afb3c5; 90fdab4e54663f3069d5f73233b982758def42d6; 0bb2970c8d7fc657acb0893366fb42f6af2b9780; ecb4a66a959b3195994d77c768b8efca231c9f33; bafa50573833bd46b35d1aa386b7496777c15b15; 02ff401d15912b92acb237eb9e50d58a432c7c33; 2ca0aca06c8d7768bac13a6d806d03678b33626b; f2ce102b51694e32e23c98cace0712415fe23118; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; b28c4871657c29d7e6a52ecd061de2d41f5b8b21; 619e6fd173b34be67ac9bbac3f7936e3b9eb15a3; 60467ff3e9e2980b430ef4aab840f7092111371e; 43dd9bb7b2045d02cf598187001675f230c00b26; 5bdd7eee341e66f36aacc09e929b045e15959fac; d0d8b4b288daa1f88cd70e39cf4a68a1eb36aeff; 32e9652729d67d3793cd8771f70ef610211ff628; fb563b56721cb2eaeb67f02fad5dbce6c91bd925; 822fac4aff7bdbec3f3e8c4bf0e419dce370dee1; d8a7fd0251b0054a97cfef882d1440ac14c43bb9,Respiratory Research,17,
39fabd8383b7c6b5750d1589a7389284b9158e23,Lower bounds in multiple testing: A framework based on derandomized proxies,"The large bulk of work in multiple testing has focused on specifying procedures that control the false discovery rate (FDR), with relatively less attention being paid to the corresponding Type II error known as the false non-discovery rate (FNR). A line of more recent work in multiple testing has begun to investigate the tradeoffs between the FDR and FNR and to provide lower bounds on the performance of procedures that depend on the model structure. Lacking thus far, however, has been a general approach to obtaining lower bounds for a broad class of models. This paper introduces an analysis strategy based on derandomization, illustrated by applications to various concrete models. Our main result is meta-theorem that gives a general recipe for obtaining lower bounds on the combination of FDR and FNR. We illustrate this meta-theorem by deriving explicit bounds for several models, including instances with dependence, scale-transformed alternatives, and non-Gaussian-like distributions. We provide numerical simulations of some of these lower bounds, and show a close relation to the actual performance of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) algorithm.",2020,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Max Rabinovich"", ids = ""1686465509""); list(name = ""Michael I.

cd4cd9b088f8ab164094355b6f970dd0b99765c2,Optimizing the Parameters Governing the Fragmentation of Cross-Linked Peptides in a Tribrid Mass Spectrometer,"We compared the five different ways of fragmentation available on a tribrid mass spectrometer and optimized their collision energies with regard to optimal sequence coverage of cross-linked peptides. We created a library of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3/DSS) cross-linked precursors, derived from the tryptic digests of three model proteins (Human Serum Albumin, creatine kinase, and myoglobin). This enabled in-depth targeted analysis of the fragmentation behavior of 1065 cross-linked precursors using the five fragmentation techniques: collision-induced dissociation (CID), beam-type CID (HCD), electron-transfer dissociation (ETD), and the combinations ETciD and EThcD. EThcD gave the best sequence coverage for cross-linked m/z species with high charge density, while HCD was optimal for all others. We tested the resulting data-dependent decision tree against collision energy-optimized single methods on two samples of differing complexity (a mix of eight proteins and a highly complex ribosomal cellular fraction). For the high complexity sample the decision tree gave the highest number of identified cross-linked peptide pairs passing a 5% false discovery rate (on average âˆ¼21% more than the second best, HCD). For the medium complexity sample, the higher speed of HCD proved decisive. Currently, acquisition speed plays an important role in allowing the detection of cross-linked peptides against the background of linear peptides. Enrichment of cross-linked peptides will reduce this role and favor methods that provide spectra of higher quality.

0be42096d5a4b70251cbdfba302f3df580b94c0b,A plasma microRNA panel for detection of colorectal adenomas: a step toward more precise screening for colorectal cancer.,"OBJECTIVE
The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential use of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers of colorectal (CR) adenomas.


BACKGROUND
Detection of precancerous lesions such as CR adenoma is a key to reduce CR cancer (CRC) mortality. There is a great need for accurate, noninvasive biomarkers for detection of CR adenoma and CRC. MiRNAs are non-protein-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Our prior work investigated the dysregulation of 5 plasma miRNAs in CRC patients. As intended, we undertook a more comprehensive plasma-miRNA screening study in patients with CR adenoma and CRC.


METHODS
We screened for 380 plasma-miRNAs using microfluidic array technology (Applied BioSystems) in a screening cohort of 12 healthy controls, 9 patients with CR adenomas, and 20 patients with CRC. A panel of the most dysregulated miRNAs (P < 0.05, False Discovery Rate: 5%) was then validated in a blinded cohort of 26 healthy controls, 16 patients with large adenomas, and 45 patients with CRC.


RESULTS
A panel of 8 plasma miRNAs (miR-532-3p, miR-331, miR-195, miR-17, miR-142-3p, miR-15b, miR-532, and miR-652) distinguished polyps from controls with high accuracy [area under curve (AUC) = 0.868 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76-0.98)]. In addition, a panel of 3 plasma miRNAs (miR-431, miR-15b, and miR-139-3p) distinguished Stage IV CRC from controls with an [AUC = 0.896 (95% CI: 0.78-1.0)]. Receiver-operating-characteristic curves of miRNA panels for all CRC versus controls and polyps versus all CRC showed AUC values of 0.829 (95% CI: 0.73-0.93) and 0.856 (95% CI: 0.75-0.97), respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
Plasma miRNAs are reliable, noninvasive, and inexpensive markers for CR adenomas. This miRNA panel warrants study in larger cohorts. Plasma-based assays could provide better screening compliance compared to fecal occult blood or endoscopic screening.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ziad Kanaan"", ids = ""4590949""); list(name = ""Henry L.

85eacc90d1c175baa935e2e4408e8ebb5542b1c5,Comparative proteomic analysis of mouse livers from embryo to adult reveals an association with progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"To identify potential oncofetal biomarkers that distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from healthy liver tissues, we compared and analyzed the proteomic profiles of mouse livers at different developmental stages. Fetal (E13.5, E16.5), newborn (NB), postnatal (3-week) and adult (3-month) livers were isolated and profiled by 2-D PAGE. Statistical analysis using linear regression and false discovery rate (FDR) revealed that 361 protein spots showed significant changes. Unsupervised hierarchical tree analysis segregated the proteins into fetal, NB, and postnatal-adult clusters. Distinctive protein markers were identified by MALDI-TOF/MS and the corresponding mRNA profiles were further determined by Q-PCR. Fetal markers (hPCNA, hHSP7C, hHEM6) and postnatal-adult markers (hARGI1, hASSY, hBHMT, hFABPL) were selected for testing against a panel of seven human hepatocyte/HCC cell lines and 59 clinical specimens. The fetal proteins were found to be overexpressed in the metastatic HCC cell lines and the tumor tissues, whereas the postnatal-adult proteins were expressed in non-tumor tissues and normal hepatocytes. This ""Ying-Yang"" pattern, as orchestrated by distinct fetal and adult markers, is hypothesized to indicate the progressive change of the liver from a growing, less-differentiated organ into a functional metabolic center. Thus, embryogenesis and tumorigenesis share certain oncofetal markers and adult ""hepatic"" phenotypes are lost in HCC.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Nikki P Lee"", ids = ""3997712""); list(name = ""Kar-wai Leung"", ids = ""153573771""); list(name = ""Nicole K Cheung"", ids = ""49850016""); list(name = ""Brian Y Lam"", ids = ""38469355""); list(name = ""Michelle Z Xu"", ids = ""32623038""); list(name = ""Pak Chung Sham"", ids = ""143966341""); list(name = ""George Ka-Kit Lau"", ids = ""2885998""); list(name = ""Ronnie Tung-ping Poon"", ids = ""3337756""); list(name = ""Sheung Tat Fan"", ids = ""2013332""); list(name = ""John Moon-Ching Luk"", ids = ""2959416"")",c4cfa0b33362d558fe849f85d74f5da495f2486a; 44f21aa5c9eebee5ecbad1b191e52ba5be8fab41; 00f0b7f829a29a58baf2755fecf57babfdd4efc9; de9e5ae1f031ec51ab879fe025e0aa2595872829; d59c903d8166a06baf6b31fd4cbec400a1e44c28; 9a21c57729711483431d14bde24525b9009086b7; 038f8dc1c425e2e547b8b4b8f3e4c4df3a75f24f; befe118dbec566075440887e8d598af49ae3b471; 1d5fb5b09668206dc13318af5c689084edb2d3a4; c6fe212d8203a9359b759912496f83a04148d0f6; 781dae013f1778052ed7380a26e8a82359a4601f; 3504f60a59780e4a62cdce77184d0704a4c0d41a; ec3b10537fe956cda14b6e7cd95e1bb464711e5b; d1d8baf224263fbe3e4c82b56430e0b827e5e460; c865962be1abd9912f37a76e54d47c504be9cabd; 30c20961f8252ba8d28227373bf360e259950a88; 3d8df957bd7b81080195e473df93e9d5075235d7; ad35839afd451d9dc694afa52c699c20909ffa99; 6ddd538998ae518e6aef4d93c0e638f6ea5b357c; 00c024ec48a1e81db5c504d14c71e199a9c82eb8; 3b086ede042a7cccb07771b7b13a0c0bf2f9a5be; 325421e43559bd5423cd4e647d96176a2efe68fe; b2d26d1b58b8c765a6c4787c41bc8207e3dc8112; ba392470347d987d30dd5cc8f30521c97882f96d; a97e093132be6889120f6f99719316c66a3445c6; f9ab3e7ec00816e87c7b5c7d2c05b2bdbb88bc32; 292cd59e7f18b813aeeb3eaf24adad3f144204b9; 0a59be46e58203e29fd268331e8ef8bdd26d7f5d,,Proteomics,8 10,"

90f798449d6a0787abf3e6438ac7ba7295e4d5fc,Protein Identification Strategies: Towards a Hybrid Approach to Control FDR,"Tandem Mass Spectrometry has made a massive advance as a main technology for peptide sequencing. It generates a flood of data that represents significant challenges for their interpretation. With the emergence of tandem mass spectrometry data (MS/MS), a lot of computational methods have been developed to infer peptide sequences from them. However, the correct identification of all proteins present in a sample is of utmost importance to provide a suitable biological interpretation. Mostly, there are two strategies, which are widely used for peptide/protein identification: (i) Database searching strategy consists of comparing the experimental spectra acquired through the mass spectrometer, with the identified spectra belonging to peptide libraries. (ii) De novo sequencing strategy predicts, without the assistance of peptide database, amino acids sequence from its tandem mass spectrum. These two strategies differ in term of their ability and effectiveness to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR). In this paper, we introduce a review study of database searching and de novo sequencing for peptide identification. Some background information of mass spectrometry and peptide/protein identification are first outlined. Afterward, we discuss the process and tools of both database searching and de novo strategies. Aiming to control the False Discovery Rate, an effective and hybrid approach, which combines database searching and de novo strategies, is proposed in this work.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sara El Jadid"", ids = ""10738249""); list(name = ""Raja Touahni"", ids = ""39336442""); list(name = ""Ahmed Moussa"", ids = ""144050363"")",,1b03414ebace3aae831362dc3ab07619e1ecb36f; 10374f736a7d745f02cfbb56581a62913c38e874; 57ac346d9cb8d7b7151428ec83b4f95e5df90829; 0f5751f76cef4a502b22ad088c381a4d0bb10121; f9b6ef3eb83592bc1ecbc9b3ccbb70d9186cdd65; 4252e3ba5aca67b6b50e52021d659afc0039b0f9; 9f602bede4f0b6efe688aead5129552234e9e14c; 48db31e1e79e823bbd807bcb544c8cc502d65209; 4e09cf2e449864c391918b538408355e53a7f17e; 17d1cf7f0de43ff5474b7baea41c8d0ebd47d7d8; c9485af9e62f3267be04fdd069fd89e069605ec6; 891672f9acbbb7715f119d9362f43120f8198676; 0af05b54a727bfe527e240c403e98080ec92a9d3; 89e71c52b44a2ec2b17043a58690e6243db0488f; 340328fa6cb5ab330faa366781eddf4ac1c3a453; 0e029de7f2adc1c2cde77cb2476f235029311475; 0fb12b8c3ae5d6a41be5ea8a8222ab9b2088ddca; 885adb72e5598cf3dbbdcf8c4683f67df9f128a6; 0503b888f2e3b4cd1295558eab6813eb22339662; 93f07cfd4d79c08e78cf61a94c260434fb69293b; 6a75a3c8bbf0209822aa293bb0a8f0903499e87c; f09d4a533a221b9b85c591ba1dc862dd2fe808a1; 490c05335c487932c2fcd97b4eb439ef67a00a03; a755b659d5ca912ac50e84acb15188b1d1ea15e7; 9b8ed151cf6caa4260796e5b8e0b39164017b3c2; ffa72a907be3cace85e397dd98654e005d5140bb; 3a481705bdedbcbbee4c8e87f7c8d1332e26dc28; de53632fb92ec71836514c94a5740a8cca044848; 22f3798827f9ef80a2eef6960d34233d791ccadb; 47a97a1d579c9bdc399f9a1255e9ababcc7a84e2; b8898f237c077c7e5e7053d7d43bbc1d4816fe1e,2018 International Symposium on Advanced Electrical and Communication Technologies (ISAECT),,1-4
27f724b4fd19143b4ed241e2e5541a382e702af6,The Genomic Basis of Noise-induced Hearing Loss: A Literature Review Organized by Cellular Pathways.,"OBJECTIVE
Using Reactome, a curated Internet database, noise-induced hearing loss studies were aggregated into cellular pathways for organization of the emerging genomic and epigenetic data in the literature.


DATA SOURCES
PubMed and Reactome.org, a relational data base program systematizing biological processes into interactive pathways and subpathways based on ontology, cellular constituents, gene expression, and molecular components.


STUDY SELECTION
Peer-reviewed population and laboratory studies for the previous 15 years relating genomics and noise and hearing loss were identified in PubMed. Criteria included p values <0.05 with correction for multiple genes, a fold change of >1.5, or duplicated studies.


DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS
One-hundred fifty-eight unique HGNC identifiers from 77 articles met the selection criteria, and were uploaded into the analysis program at http://reactome.org. These genes participated in a total of 621 cellular interactions in 21 of 23 pathways. Cellular response to stress with its attenuation phase, particularly in response to heat stress, detoxification of ROS, and specific areas of the immune system are predominant pathways identified as significantly 'overrepresented' (p values <0.1e-5 and false discovery rates <0.01).


CONCLUSION
Twenty-one of 23 of the designated pathways in Reactome have significant influence on noise-induced hearing loss, signifying a confluence of molecular pathways in reaction to acoustic trauma; however, cellular response to stress, including heat shock response, and other small areas of immune response were highly overrepresented. Yet-to-be-explored genomics areas include miRNA, lncRNA, copy number variations, RNA sequencing, and human genome-wide association study.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Royce E.

a6eb6359dd097000f25eb790662180e502022549,The Role of Polymorphisms in DNA Repair Genes and HPV 18 Integration Status in Cervical Dysplasia,"Despite the fact that cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women worldwide, research has yet to elucidate why some HPV-infected women develop cancerous lesions while others are able to clear the infection. Previous studies have shown that HPV integration status may be associated with cervical cancer development, and yet, host genetic factors that may be involved in the viral integration process have not yet been identified. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between both HPV 18 viral integration status and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway genes on cervical dysplasia. Specifically, we sought to compare women with no dysplasia to those with low-grade or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.

Methods: A total of 765 women were selected from two large trials designed to evaluate optical technologies for cervical cancer. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Golden Gate platform. HPV 18 integration status was determined using a previously established protocol. Chi-square tests were conducted to determine which SNPs were associated with normal cytology, low-grade, or high-grade lesions. Among participants with cervical dysplasia, polytomous logistic regression models were used to evaluate the effect of each polymorphism on viral integration status. An additive genetic model was used for all tests. P-values were adjusted using the false discovery rate method.

Results: Women with high-grade lesions were significantly younger than women with low-grade or no lesions. Tag-SNPs in 13 DNA repair genes, including MRE11A, ATM, and XRCC4, were significantly associated with cervical dysplasia. Most participants had a mix of both episomal and integrated HPV 18. Tag-SNPs in the XRCC4, PRKCH, and MRE11A genes were found to be significantly associated with HPV 18 integration status.

Conclusion: Our study indicates that host genetic variation in NHEJ DNA repair pathway genes, including MRE11A and XRCC4, are significantly associated with HPV 18 integration, and that these genes may play a key role in determining cervical cancer development and progression. This is the first study to examine host genetic variation in association with the viral integration event.

f8ccffe2a5d00487585b0f7a2393cc23529d9bab,Interactions between metallopeptidase 3 polymorphism rs679620 and BMI in predicting blood pressure in African-American women with hypertension.,"BMI represents an internal metabolic and physiological environment that plays a key role in development of high blood pressure (BP) for many Americans. African-American women have a higher prevalence of high BP and being overweight than men or other ethnic groups. This study examines the genetic-environmental interaction effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms and BMI on BP among African-American women using 1418 African-American women and men from the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy study. A total of 403 tests of single nucleotide polymorphism-BMI interaction were conducted using methods of internal replication, cross-validation, and false discovery rate. One single nucleotide polymorphism (located in the ATP6B1 gene, rs2266917) passed adjustments for multiple testing and had a significant independent main effect (P = 0.0018) on diastolic BP among African-American women. A significant sex-specific interaction effect was found between MMP3_rs679620 and BMI in African-American women (P = 0.0009). MMP3_rs679620 (A-G polymorphism) encodes a Lys-Glu nonsynonymous variant at the 45th amino acid of metallopeptidase 3 and indicates a putative functional modification of metallopeptidase 3.

2813513661873fec062b5ff4cbbac75afc8ac6d0,Molecular Pathogenesis of Post-Transplant Acute Kidney Injury: Assessment of Whole-Genome mRNA and MiRNA Profiles,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects roughly 25% of all recipients of deceased donor organs. The prevention of post-transplant AKI is still an unmet clinical need. We prospectively collected zero-hour, indication as well as protocol kidney biopsies from 166 allografts between 2011 and 2013. In this cohort eight cases with AKI and ten matched allografts without pathology serving as control group were identified with a follow-up biopsy within the first twelve days after engraftment. For this set the zero-hour and follow-up biopsies were subjected to genome wide microRNA and mRNA profiling and analysis, followed by validation in independent expression profiles of 42 AKI and 21 protocol biopsies for strictly controlling the false discovery rate. Follow-up biopsies of AKI allografts compared to time-matched protocol biopsies, further baseline adjustment for zero-hour biopsy expression level and validation in independent datasets, revealed a molecular AKI signature holding 20 mRNAs and two miRNAs (miR-182-5p and miR-21-3p). Next to several established biomarkers such as lipocalin-2 also novel candidates of interest were identified in the signature. In further experimental evaluation the elevated transcript expression level of the secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI) in AKI allografts was confirmed in plasma and urine on the protein level (p<0.001 and pâ€Š=â€Š0.003, respectively). miR-182-5p was identified as a molecular regulator of post-transplant AKI, strongly correlated with global gene expression changes during AKI. In summary, we identified an AKI-specific molecular signature providing the ground for novel biomarkers and target candidates such as SLPI and miR-182-5p in addressing AKI.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Julia Wilflingseder"", ids = ""3777473""); list(name = ""Judith Sunzenauer"", ids = ""4272060""); list(name = ""Eva Toronyi"", ids = ""6662066""); list(name = ""Andreas Heinzel"", ids = ""2917978""); list(name = ""Alexander Kainz"", ids = ""143822799""); list(name = ""Bernd Mayer"", ids = ""2171646""); list(name = ""Paul Perco"", ids = ""2339846""); list(name = ""GÃ¡bor Telkes"", ids = ""3643002""); list(name = ""RÃ³bert M.

A total of 30 CNVs ranging from 30,237â€¯bp to 4,910,757â€¯bp were identified. These CNVs were then associated with six growth traits by a linear regression analysis. Three significant associations were identified between two CNVs and two body traits after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (Pâ€¯<â€¯.05). One of them (CNV27) was significantly associated with both chest width and width of pin bones. It overlaps the SNX29 gene, the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of which indicate CNV27 could be a potential functional candidate for meat production, health and reproduction traits.

To assess the accuracy of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2) in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) using whole-mount sections after radical prostatectomy (RP) as reference standard.


METHODS
Forty-eight patients undergoing mpMRI before RP were prospectively enrolled. Two experienced radiologists independently scored and mapped imaging findings according to PI-RADS v2. One experienced uropathologist mapped cancers detected on whole-mount sections using the PI-RADS v2 sector scheme. Per-lesion and per-patient analyses were run. Primary outcomes were sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) in detecting csPCa using PI-RADS v2 score â‰¥3 and â‰¥4 as thresholds. Secondary outcome was inter-reader agreement.


RESULTS
On the per-lesion analysis, sensitivity and FDR at the PI-RADS v2 threshold score â‰¥3 were 0.75 and 0.17 for Reader 1, and 0.67 and 0.13 for Reader 2, respectively. At the PI-RADS v2 threshold score â‰¥4, sensitivity was slightly lower, and FDR nearly halved for both readers. On the per-patient analysis, sensitivity for csPCa at the PI-RADS v2 threshold score â‰¥3 was 0.85 for Reader 1, and 0.78 for Reader 2. At the PI-RADS v2 threshold score â‰¥4, sensitivity was slightly lower for both readers. Inter-reader agreement was substantial (k 0.72 and 0.65 for PI-RADS v2 threshold score â‰¥3 and â‰¥4, respectively).


CONCLUSION
In our prospective study with pathology after RP as standard of reference, PI-RADS v2 showed good sensitivity in detecting csPCa on mpMRI with substantial agreement between 2 experienced readers.

12cddba70f3b9471a8d824a9572eefca73af000e,A rapid and accurate approach for Prediction of interactomes from co-elution data (PrInCE),"Background An organismâ€™s protein interactome, or complete network of protein-protein interactions, defines the protein complexes that drive cellular processes. Techniques for studying protein complexes have traditionally applied targeted strategies such as yeast two-hybrid or affinity purification-mass spectrometry to assess protein interactions. However, given the vast number of protein complexes, more scalable methods are necessary to accelerate interaction discovery and to construct whole interactomes. We recently developed a complementary technique based on the use of protein correlation profiling (PCP) and stable isotope labeling in amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to assess chromatographic co-elution as evidence of interacting proteins. Importantly, PCP-SILAC is also capable of measuring protein interactions simultaneously under multiple biological conditions, allowing the detection of treatment-specific changes to an interactome. Given the uniqueness and high dimensionality of co-elution data, new tools are needed to compare protein elution profiles, control false discovery rates, and construct an accurate interactome. Results Here we describe a freely available bioinformatics pipeline, PrInCE, for the analysis of co-elution data. PrInCE is a modular, open-source library that is computationally inexpensive, able to use label and label-free data, and capable of detecting tens of thousands of protein-protein interactions. Using a machine learning approach, PrInCE offers greatly reduced run time, better performance, prediction of protein complexes, and greater ease of use over previous bioinformatics tools for co-elution data. PrInCE is implemented in Matlab (version R2015b). Source code and standalone executable programs for Windows and Mac OSX are available at https://github.com/fosterlab/PrInCE, where usage instructions can be found. An example dataset and output are also provided for testing purposes. Conclusions PrInCE is the first fast and easy-to-use data analysis pipeline that predicts interactomes and protein complexes from co-elution data. PrInCE allows researchers without bioinformatics proficiency to analyze high-throughput co-elution datasets.",2017,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""R.

From each sample, 25Â Âµg of total protein was subjected to trypsin digestion and subsequently LCâ€“MS/MS analysis was performed for the deep proteome analysis. The data acquired after the LCâ€“MS/MS analysis were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4. The identified peptide matches were validated using percolator, at less than 1% false discovery rates.ResultsA total of 625, 594 and 636 proteins were identified in PACG, POAG and cataract groups, respectively (nÂ =Â 9 in each group). The inter-group comparison among all these groups showed that 246 proteins were identified in all the three groups. An average of 236Â Â±Â 42, 218Â Â±Â 40 and 214Â Â±Â 62 proteins from each AH sample of PACG, POAG and cataract, respectively, was identified. There were 53 proteins commonly found in all 9 PACG AH, 59 proteins in POAG AH and 42 proteins in 9 cataracts AH samples. In the individual analysis, there were 28 proteins found in all the samples analyzed representing the â€œconstitutive AH proteome.â€ Spectral counting analysis of 246 proteins identified in all three group types showed significant differences in protein abundance. In proteins unique to PACG AH, 7 proteins viz. ARHGEF12, APC2, WAS, PIK3CG, ITGB1, MSN and PFN1 out of 226 were found in â€œRegulation of Actin Cytoskeletonâ€ pathway, whereas in POAG 5 out of 206Â proteins viz. ADCY2, ITPR1, MAPK3, MAP3K2 and TUBB1 were found in â€œGap Junctionâ€ pathway.ConclusionsA qualitative as well as a quantitative comparison of proteomes of AH from PACG, POAG and age-related cataract eyes showed significant differences, thus providing clues to the disease pathophysiology.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Inderjeet Kaur"", ids = ""2611932""); list(name = ""Jasbir Kaur"", ids = ""48784104""); list(name = ""K.

3f15c7d0ff668f43d515242f8cb191b1b6ce6998,Parallel factor analysis enables quantification and identification of highly-convolved data independent-acquired protein spectra,"High-throughput data-independent acquisition (DIA) is the method of choice for quantitative proteomics, combining the best practices of targeted and shotgun proteomics approaches. The resultant DIA spectra are, however, highly convolved and with no direct precursor-fragment correspondence, complicating the analysis of biological samples. Here we present PARADIAS (PARAllel factor analysis of Data Independent Acquired Spectra), a GPU-powered unsupervised multiway factor analysis framework that deconvolves multispectral scans to individual analyte spectra, chromatographic profiles, and sample abundances, using the PARAFAC tensor decomposition method based on variation of informative spectral features. The deconvolved spectra can be annotated with traditional database search engines or used as a high-quality input for de novo sequencing methods. We demonstrate that spectral libraries generated with PARADIAS substantially reduce the false discovery rate underlying the validation of spectral quantification. PARADIAS covers up to 33 times more total ion current than library-based approaches, which typically use less than 5 % of total recorded ions, thus allowing the quantification and identification of signals from unexplored DIA spectra.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Filip Buric"", ids = ""88200478""); list(name = ""Jan Zrimec"", ids = ""46858310""); list(name = ""Aleksej Zelezniak"", ids = ""49629278"")",,48341a156bb0e66f4beb40324adc25f18c006104; 31e756a139b83a55a2de8a1d74e69baadc7a75ac; 0005fc5111f7f0ea189fb11f3ae00790d5c870d3; 6e954555bd241dffdaf62e47abc253ce1e2e8c5c; 0942e7c87919b27b8eecc1ca64c675c02e619b45; 833e033192e47bf20267ff48c86e87efe0202d08; 11e4116c9de619f0c82a0346a1989a9411a2aa3c; 8917c6454dc32f3cf5a86b52c2aaaf3a3c269950; d2855325c5ea2083130be881fc7aecd468ce80f3; f0a473202af221e7765bd634391236367b062e2b; 3dec9156722f58775a7de0781f333c37f62a6dd1; 032ad810aae2a7547a9481777f1ca3c3ba6b8632; c321644d95c24bb4f980f0fe8fd000e82d779c9f; b36a5bb1707bb9c70025294b3a310138aae8327a; fcdd0cb264c87c75b2cc80b5f7f6dbc32e0f28d7; b55ab3d520da2c5d4a3d9a6df9b318a9d8199c76; 490f0e755b9cf5792e61b18212a3b15824d35ffa; 3beada29eae2d9c21cf8f54b1b4a5f006a93408e; 28d2503b0f86dd3947bf745efdd609dee7975cd8; 49cc2f20f47047579a636816113a92d82e1485c7; f0d35b37fec26c3f1ed09253cbb9304fb62208d1; af36e48b2a87d8d7b669bf0f05084f152167e245; bb7dd15bd2e6d008443c2546db77b63a01d57bbd; 89efcd0884f97b894f9040b316b63cc82ca1ca1c; e45a8d7176bd738c1e63de1f6791a88e704f8b4b; 757cb62e3d1c0643c9f83bf57d45e427bd76e235; 48f99f52d2d7a09292c218e67aab9058a603e329; 87c9767c57b3baf39345e8e3cc83c3638ed96d69; 732a08c44966db6b41570f80f8006434855faf2a; 0ab02b9ac912ae86f8725c8c4ab49a58232607d9; ab13537e5123c8a1713bbf5abee407f974496578; 941e34557902ee16c377c7204d92f8bba003c050; bb42fdc02774abdf2991e0246ce58f97dd946cfa; 2b2eaf0a473ebaf5e4250abb7efb34d4b2265dc6; 3acf11cb970ec0652161e31cb8df5eb3c1223f47; 5f1b968176937f79d8eb0c9252040b70ad05d51d; 2b5b50a62c2e432ab0e9392dc7a03f833e60d792; 83bffc27faab4c7846825b99370356a4c9a6e61d; 8050743bdccda5070f7c96f87a9d451da40f988b; ec0d183dbf4481de6c9bf8f5b3ca8ad44bcbf14f; 23fe9729cc5a95e0c59d08cca7dbe458989600be; d9aa22a43dbd3d134d7af14f7c64f7e84faf7d1c; 0ccfc172cc3ba9ee0d9b1f00ecbcca182aca6d6e; 8ce5660f3e51c17cd40bf5082798e05062ddc026; 6544a071b7896f654d38d9b7b3e5404436c34f60; fa98e294f985c43261753139ce319f23cc246095; 6a2c31c142fe40601b366afe7eee1a6e85e5bc76; a9fd88b15d0f47dc6a9cc85ccd7072982645126c; 9c55acff92bfc3dfc5b12eddbb845c075896d866; c5b28cae82b14417f1250e58bb241367248e827d; 8b97b0061f3de4b87831edf38fcedb1baee1756d; 85833333448779f6380a4fffc3aa48f5f47183f2; 3213793dc120ef6583f71125c0e92e323471d0bc; 3efbbec0517c58a4560eb8252735bba3ee3ca0e4; cb659b8621aec26753be46335f563b3addd119de; 014560136ee40e8fccbd606c051bc9683526a856; 285ac495decbc69fc9a00fc1164faa60e24ce4e5; 29eb4a91ef11efdbe8161522c7cccbd523e6e1a7,bioRxiv,,
edcf37921ec68996761007e4a8411f1f3e31276c,Mapping modifiers affecting muscularity of the myostatin mutant (Mstn(Cmpt-dl1Abc)) compact mouse.,"The hypermuscular Compact phenotype was first noted in a line of mice selected for high body weight and protein content. A new line, based on mice showing the Compact phenotype, was formed and selected for maximum expression of the Compact phenotype. Previously we mapped and identified a 12-bp deletion in the myostatin gene, denoted Mstn(Cmpt-dl1Abc), which can be considered as a major gene responsible for the hypermuscular phenotype. Genetic analysis revealed that full expression of the hypermuscular phenotype requires the action of modifier loci in addition to Mstn(Cmpt-dl1Abc). To map these modifier loci, an interspecific F(2) population was generated between Comp9, an inbred line homozygous for Mstn(Cmpt-dl1Abc), and CAST/Ei, an inbred line generated from Mus musculus castaneus. Selective DNA pooling and genotyping, separately by gender, was carried out within a subpopulation of the F(2) consisting of individuals homozygous for Mstn(Cmpt-dl1Abc). Significant association with hypermuscularity at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 was found for markers on chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 11, 16, and X. In all cases, the marker allele derived from the Comp9 parent showed a higher frequency in the hypermuscular group and the CAST/Ei allele in the normal group. The modifier loci apparently exerted their effects on muscularity only in the presence of Mstn(Cmpt-dl1Abc).",2003,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""LÃ¡szlÃ³ Varga"", ids = ""50452247""); list(name = ""GÃ©za MÃ¼ller"", ids = ""3151965""); list(name = ""Gyula Szabo"", ids = ""47584131""); list(name = ""Orsolya Pinke"", ids = ""13230409""); list(name = ""Edit Korom"", ids = ""14635680""); list(name = ""BalÃ¡zs KovÃ¡cs"", ids = ""145491949""); list(name = ""LÃ¡szlÃ³ Patthy"", ids = ""3295916""); list(name = ""Morris Soller"", ids = ""144570183"")",b2d49ee43426bd547f17f9679d81116287b57070; 4a2f0eeea73c932866ee3440bd678ad48e830568; 4b206cd21dcc1e69b91258a2f848caab17c71db5; 01d9a04eefb41d154d043eaecd28f7180d5d65ef; 41af7ff8403cc72b57e8c15610a3542a66424fa0; 1a13f1a22d106e118f54da122ff0f95b21b74a4d; ab5bc2d4da921823ef2a25b310038787942a4b5a; 8d678fd456350edcece9789ee5ba456389fa2ec8; ac10cd9a5c3e100c49668f535f3686f21be184da; 0805496419d2c3e3810b70ef588845b5e65973a2; 2fa82477fc625d6f25b1197d0e50f36766d21378; 5f17a50e3706916181ba15a29d3cbcafb8304d5f; 8903bfbbe6dce95883f7a6eef1d2519b2effabb1; 21ecb5e688521b36db682776bff3eb2c7abbff1d; 05ad18f9ff0431d549bdbaeb8e80abb9c5cb90e4; 47150975ff702397c03df7b9e037734b775dfd9e; 7a4824f04f0fe2133b561dc6216b189f8af643fc; e9ab290b7cc509e81ff027dd002a3440f0496931; eca6db2f9bb59a387ff5090b03d5f45f76cc8da0; 6912f6c9f8d54355c776678831f1b517b625c7ba; 9d50471ce968e663b6e35841a46c94c933e04a7c; 14e2df6dcf55cff78a4d2cebaf220b81e6d5d86d; 09b3381121adf31ff3d2e11a208605dd9452cf35,,Genetics,165 1,"

ea6b91f241e42cb2bb4cfd7f052408b46a96054a,Stability SCAD: a powerful approach to detect interactions in large-scale genomic study,"BackgroundEvidence suggests that common complex diseases may be partially due to SNP-SNP interactions, but such detection is yet to be fully established in a high-dimensional small-sample (small-n-large-p) study. A number of penalized regression techniques are gaining popularity within the statistical community, and are now being applied to detect interactions. These techniques tend to be over-fitting, and are prone to false positives. The recently developed stability least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (SLASSO) has been used to control family-wise error rate, but often at the expense of power (and thus false negative results).ResultsHere, we propose an alternative stability selection procedure known as stability smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SSCAD). Briefly, this method applies a smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) algorithm to multiple sub-samples, and then identifies cluster ensemble of interactions across the sub-samples. The proposed method was compared with SLASSO and two kinds of traditional penalized methods by intensive simulation. The simulation revealed higher power and lower false discovery rate (FDR) with SSCAD. An analysis using the new method on the previously published GWAS of lung cancer confirmed all significant interactions identified with SLASSO, and identified two additional interactions not reported with SLASSO analysis.ConclusionsBased on the results obtained in this study, SSCAD presents to be a powerful procedure for the detection of SNP-SNP interactions in large-scale genomic data.",2013,Medicine; Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jianwei Gou"", ids = ""9873537""); list(name = ""Yang Zhao"", ids = ""145940718""); list(name = ""Yongyue Wei"", ids = ""145388770""); list(name = ""Chen Wu"", ids = ""143622133""); list(name = ""Ruyang Zhang"", ids = ""7265522""); list(name = ""Yongyong Qiu"", ids = ""2297987""); list(name = ""Ping Zeng"", ids = ""143679225""); list(name = ""Wen Tan"", ids = ""144641351""); list(name = ""Dianke Yu"", ids = ""40479379""); list(name = ""Tangchun Wu"", ids = ""3567607""); list(name = ""Zhibin Hu"", ids = ""1999410""); list(name = ""Dongxin Lin"", ids = ""47415043""); list(name = ""Hongbing Shen"", ids = ""144355454""); list(name = ""Feng Chen"", ids = ""144180429"")",5a84e67ec25950bc399ccb4910ab8bc0b14a39dc; 89fb8c2bd76165271e19e83dba8ab687552b6526,b1739466efe72413ac55dc1cc10cd0424383524d; 66f6a5b8da9cb79d8502cf899de6cee3612ad780; 43a83fc18677c7c863bdcbbe966be0c465c94a4d; e3abc33685260b717d4ec73df312b115a0b865d7; 05043cc44c382c4c1e5a0cddc313d4c7120cd646; c096ae6edd1645b5f81a26b160fae301c119af78; 5c54fa8123e1e73cad9a2bd313588985cef5a5ea; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; e13f04ac40ce0c3d70410e7977ef20ef277eb91c; 06ebbf165013550c0b68274d766ddc3cfbbbac22; d984d1c81e61626dac691d1716c373551314cb1d; dd1b3a3793619cec8994cc7cca10e6dee656fb7b; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; 4a109de3938692a354de3f29eb4eb6a09715c360; 7b199a03470ba82ed10f98cf996a6cf16032aa5e; 78200101cb94b926b376f38571bffcaf0f9cc50e; da3eb7f2145636de1197723da120856da27ee073; 7ec7e24dd4025819ae386a9ae016465f8d5076d1; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 10694a39afb734f25347b433f84c74c57aac7cea; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f9c8ef10a2dc19bb29730a25f8f8b19a053572bd; 0beba3199494c062434b8868569e7db37a13739d; aacfb05cf5a64fffa3cb5017012e4595534a0a1b; ab9fe0fe3b39e6f36dcf74a715e7adcd218325b2; 22c9484b32f68ce691b5bc815e589cdff6abee3d; 1f1b750baf5b0fa427c5b38379cdcc8d70634d36; b7c3813e1b4b84f83cb72fc9a452dba4d4967a7f; 2e1e3c15ba365b3a1acb79fec5e22c8e97048347; a6d2cc4c78098cb50292aa3bb67b98d0ec64aa52; ef767b585b5d72e2194060060100d349b1f0486d,BMC Bioinformatics,15,62 - 62

Within the context of reproductive biology, microarray based transcriptomic analysis of oocyte and surrounding cumulus/granulosa cells poses significant challenges due to limited amount of samples and/or potential contaminations from adjacent cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of sampling bias on consistency of the microarray differential expression analysis in the field of reproduction. Experiments were conducted on five datasets obtained from publicly available microarray repositories. For each dataset, probe level expression values were extracted and background adjustment, inter-array quantile normalization and probe set summarization were performed according to the Robust Multi-Chip Average algorithm. Genes with a false discovery rate-corrected p value of <;0.05 and [Fold Change] > 2 were considered as differentially expressed. Results demonstrate that both number of replicates and including different subsets of available samples in the analysis alter the number of differentially expressed genes.

Epidemiologic studies, including the Environment and Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE), have reported increased consumption of red and processed meats to be associated with higher risk of lung cancer. Several plausible molecular mechanisms, including endogenous heme-iron exposure, may link meat with lung cancer. No study has investigated the mechanisms underlying this association using whole genome expression. We used Affymetrix HG U133A chip to measure genome-wide expression differences by meat intake in fresh frozen tumor and non-involved lung tissues of 72 adeonocarcinoma patients from the EAGLE study. EAGLE is a large population-based case-control study of 2100 cases and 2120 controls living in the North of Italy, a region with high consumption of fresh red and processed meats. Among individuals with gene expression data, we compared the gene expression profile between individuals consuming high-versus-low meat intake, based on the distribution of the entire EAGLE population, using unadjusted two samples t-test and sex, age, and smoking adjusted ANOVA test. We found that gene expression profile in tumor tissue significantly distinguished lung adenocarcinoma cases who consumed above and below the median intake of fresh red meats among all stage patients (269 gene-probes, maximum False Discovery Rate (FDR) = 0.12, based on a single gene-probe p-value threshold of 0.001), and even more strongly among early stage patients (341 gene-probes, FDR = 0.10). We further studied the identified gene signature by means of a) manually curate literature search, b) cross comparison of several pathway analysis tools, and c) investigation of transcription factor master regulators. We identified genes involved in molecular functions that may play a key role in meat-related carcinogenesis, including heme binding transport activity (CYP4A11, TPO, CYP2C8, NENF, CYP3443, SLC1A2, SLC5A7, SLC30A6, HGR, HPX, HFE), transcription regulator activity (ELK1, FOXB1, SOX10, SOX21, SOX5, PAX3, MAF, MAP2K7), and folate-related activity (MTHFR). A replication study of the candidate gene expression signature identified in EAGLE, using Real-Time Quantitative PCR, is ongoing in additional 50 lung cancer cases from an independent population of high meat consumers. For the confirmed genes, we plan to investigate whether common genetic variants in these genes modify meat-related lung cancer risk associations using Genome Wide Association data in all 4000 EAGLE subjects. In conclusion, we identified candidate genes belonging to several molecular pathways whose expression differentiates between high-versus-low consumers of fresh red meats and consequently may contribute to the etiology of meat-related lung carcinogenesis.

ba80a5a45d15562283a2ea9f094f84e8b449ae29,Comprehensive analysis of differential gene expression profiles on d-galactosamine-induced acute mouse liver injury and regeneration,"Microarray analysis of RNA from d-galactosamine (GalN)-administered mouse livers was performed to establish a global gene expression profile during injury and regeneration stages at two different doses. A single dose of GalN at 266 or 26.6 mg/kg body weight was given intraperitoneally, and the liver samples were obtained after 6, 24, and 72 h. Histopathologic studies enabled the classification of the d-galactosamine effect into injury (6, 24 h) and regeneration (72 h) stages. By using the Applied Biosystems mouse genome survey microarray, a total of 7267 out of 33,315 (21.8%) genes were found to be statistically reliable at p < 0.05 by two-way ANOVA, and 1469 (4.4%) probes at false discovery rate <5% by significance analysis of microarray. Among the statistically reliable clones by both analytical methods, 389 genes were differentially expressed when compared with non-treated control, with more than a 1.625-fold difference (which equals 0.7 in log2 scale) at one or more GalN treatment conditions and with less than 1.625-fold difference at all three vehicle-treated conditions. Three hundred thirty six genes and 13 genes were identified as injury- and regeneration-specific genes, respectively, showing that most of the transcriptomic changes were seen during the injury stage. Furthermore, multiple genes involved in protein synthesis and degradation, mRNA processing and binding, and cell cycle regulation showed variable transcript levels upon acute GalN administration.

80708e4f19550ebf0e1cf7ccbf6090f42d546b51,Statistical Algorithms for High-throughput Biological Data /,"Recent advances in high-throughput technologies, such as tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and next generation sequencing (NGS), have enabled the acquisition of huge amount of biological data containing whole genome/proteome scale information. However, due to their huge size and complexity, the interpretation of such data has become the bottleneck for further biological applications; many related computational algorithms and standardized statistical methods are still missing. Therefore, the development of efficient statistical algorithms has become essential to analyze and access massive biological data. In this dissertation, statistical algorithms for the peptide identification via MS/MS spectra and the somatic mutation profiling via NGS read data are presented. Peptide/protein identification via mass spectrometry is an important task for proteomics studies. Two most widely used approaches are the database search and the de novo peptide sequencing. We first present UniNovo, a universal de novo peptide sequencing algorithm that works well for various types of spectra from different experimental protocols and MS instrument configurations. Next we introduce MS-GappedDictionary, an algorithm that enables fast and sensitive searches of huge proteome databases (which have been prohibitively time consuming with existing approaches) using de novo sequences generated from tandem mass spectra. Lastly we present a statistical method to validate the accuracy of false discovery rate (FDR) estimation in database searches and suggest a standard method for more accurate estimation of FDRs. The later part of this dissertation focuses on the somatic mutation profiling via NGS read data. The goal of the somatic mutation profiling is to identify genetic alterations that occur after conception, or somatic mutations. Since the somatic mutations can (but not always) cause cancer or other diseases, their identification is crucial for downstream disease studies. However, sensitive identification of somatic mutations is a hard task because they are extremely rare events (1-10 occurrences per 1 Mega base pairs). We introduce a novel algorithm for identifying somatic mutations which incorporates the possible contamination of biological samples into the model. Using both simulated and experimental datasets, we demonstrate that our algorithm has higher sensitivity than other state-of-the-art algorithms",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Kyowon Jeong"", ids = ""40638242"")",,,,,

However, despite major endeavors to understand the pathogenesis, the diagnosis of IPF remains elusive [1]. Metabolic profiling of biopsied tissue specimens has been shown promise to gain insights into IPF pathogenesis [2]. Thus we hypothesized that analysis of exhaled metabolites may also provide further insights. Methods: 21 patients with IPF and 21 matched controls were recruited for this exploratory study. Exhaled breath analysis was performed by Secondary Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (SESI-MS) [3]. Significant differences in exhaled metabolite levels in IPF were subsequently sought. A two-sample t-test followed by estimation of false discovery rate in multiple comparisons was used for this purpose. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Finally, we attempted to predict IPF vs control in a leaveone-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) using a set of 15 metabolites per sample predicted. Results: Fig. 1A shows an example of six replicate exhalations of one subject for one particular metabolite with the molecular formula C16H23NO5 (m/z 310.1640). Fig.1B shows the same compound exhaled in a selected group of controls (left-hand-side) and IPF patients (right-hand-side). The graph suggests that this particular compound is exhaled in higher concentrations in IPF patients than in controls. Fig. 1C shows the ROC curve obtained as a result of the LOOCV. The obtained area under the curve was 0.8 (0.61-0.91). Conclusions: Analysis of exhaled breath by real time mass spectrometry shows promise to help in the diagnostic process of IPF. Breath analysis complements ongoing efforts to characterize IPF at the metabolic level using more invasive approaches (e.g. biopsy). Ongoing in-depth structural identification of altered breath metabolites is likely to provide insights on IPF pathogenesis.

This study aimed to investigate the resting-state functional connectivity of the hypothalamus and its relationships with gonadal steroid hormones and depression symptoms in perimenopausal women.


METHODS
Total 66 perimenopausal women voluntarily participated in this study from October 2012 to June 2013. Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (ZSDS) was used to assess depression symptoms. Plasma gonadal steroid hormones including estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone were determined by the chemiluminescence immunoassay. A 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner was utilized to acquire resting-state functional MRI data. The z-value functional connectivity map of each participant was calculated voxel-wisely based on the seed region of the hypothalamus. One sample t test of Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) were used to determine the brain areas with statistically significant functional connectivity to the hypothalamus, then multiple regression of SPM was used to calculate the correlated areas with 3 gonadal steroid hormones, respectively. Finally, Pearson correlation was performed to analyze bivariate correlations between mean z-values and ZSDS scores.


RESULTS
Significant functional connectivity to the hypothalamus were found in brain areas as follows:the lateral inferior frontal gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, subgenual cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, cuneus and precuneus, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, and angular gyrus (False Discovery Rate q<0.05). Among these areas, the plasma testosterone level was positively related to the functional connectivity strength of the right angular gyrus, and negatively related to the strengths of the right subgenual cortex and bilateral medial superior frontal gyrus to the hypothalamus (PAlphaSim<0.05). Especially, mean z-value in the subgenual cortex was positively related to the ZSDS index score (r=0.279, P=0.023), and factor scores of the core depression symptoms (r=0.278, P=0.024) and somatic symptoms (r=0.357, P=0.003).


CONCLUSION
In perimenopausal women, the hypothalamus has resting-state functional connectivity with widespread areas involved in the brain depression-related network and default mode network, and the plasma androgen level may modulate the functional connectivity strengths of the hypothalamus and decrease the susceptibility of perimenopausal women to depression.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xianglan Wang"", ids = ""8416530""); list(name = ""Jiong Tao"", ids = ""47060875""); list(name = ""Zhiyong Zhong"", ids = ""50676170""); list(name = ""Sha Liu"", ids = ""1777681""); list(name = ""Zili Han"", ids = ""8246608""); list(name = ""Jinbei Zhang"", ids = ""47538919""); list(name = ""Lingjiang Li"", ids = ""35956010"")",,,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,95 39,"

Two popular (voxelwise) methods are the Bonferroni procedure (BF), which controls the familywise error rate (FWER), and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (BH), which controls the false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini & Hochberg 1995). Multiple testing procedures are typically evaluated on their average performance with respect to error rates, ignoring the aspect of variability. Resampling techniques allow to assess the selection variability of individual features (voxels). Following the approach of Gordon, Chen, Glazko & Yakovlev (2009) in the context of gene selection, we investigated whether variability on test results for BF and BH can be reduced by including both the significance and selection variability of the voxels in the decision criterion.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Joke Durnez"", ids = ""46944603""); list(name = ""Beatrijs Moerkerke"", ids = ""144111638"")",,,,,
cff84db54959d3c463bd0f3d1f7e6f3334bb6e35,A Comprehensive Analysis of the CaMK2A Gene and Susceptibility to Alzheimerâ€™s Disease in the Han Chinese Population,"There is ample evidence suggesting that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMK2A) may play an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This genetic study aimed to investigate whether CaMK2A confers susceptibility to the development of AD in the Han Chinese population. A total of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CaMK2A were screened in two independent cohorts from southwestern China (333 AD patients and 334 controls) and eastern China (382 AD patients and 426 controls) to discern the potential association between this gene and AD. In addition, a cross-platform normalized expression resource was used to investigate whether CaMK2A is differentially expressed in the brain between individuals with AD and the controls. In addition, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis was used to explore the differences in CaMK2A expression in the brain among different genotypes. The cross-platform normalized data showed significant differences in CaMK2A expression in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and temporal cortex between the AD patients and the control subjects (|log FC| > 0.1, P < 0.05); however, only the differences in the hippocampus and temporal cortex remained after the multiple comparisons correction [false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected, P < 0.05]. The frequency of the rs4958445 genotype was significantly different between the AD subjects and the controls from southwestern China (P = 0.013, P = 0.034 after FDR correction). When the two samples were combined, rs4958445 still showed a significant association with AD (P = 0.044). Haplotype analysis indicated that the T-A-C-A-T-C-C and T-G-C-A-T-C-C haplotypes in the southwestern cohort and the T-G-C-G-C-T-C haplotype in the eastern cohort, consisting of rs10051644, rs6869634, rs3797617, rs3756577, rs4958445, rs10515639 and rs6881743, showed a significant association with AD (P = 0.037, P = 0.026 and P = 0.045, respectively). Furthermore, the brain eQTL analysis revealed a significant association between the rs4958445 polymorphism and CaMK2A expression in the inferior olivary nucleus (P = 0.029). Our results suggest an important role for CaMK2A in the pathophysiology of AD in the Han Chinese population, especially the southwestern population.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xinyu Fang"", ids = ""2792538""); list(name = ""Wei Tang"", ids = ""30033722""); list(name = ""Fuyin Yang"", ids = ""11235116""); list(name = ""Weihong Lu"", ids = ""2042058""); list(name = ""Jun Cai"", ids = ""145062603""); list(name = ""Jianliang Ni"", ids = ""4987575""); list(name = ""Jiangtao Zhang"", ids = ""50561871""); list(name = ""Wenxin Tang"", ids = ""6558754""); list(name = ""Tao Li"", ids = ""144131891""); list(name = ""Deng-Feng Zhang"", ids = ""49357303""); list(name = ""Chen Zhang"", ids = ""50445667"")",,c60663c460b9843f78f5dbee59aaf926232b6d48; c54dcfbb58f3ab20e9c5f5ae493be6a51083bbbd; b6b244bcb52b9b257cfa9c77c70ee4df3ecc6ffe; a33987b62daf15f71af7f0ea2cabd0cb7caddda6; 99070a40c81921e90b4f29dfd5a728c926041122; 97647d3c1c8b7821ed81526ecf8b26bd12e01814; f46ffe69d420f909cf7a1c6860bddeed3d254863; 6fd331e756fa5d74ae0bb808a30eeed7efcf60aa; 805c9808688fd5fa1e890fc914da0e3c35dd0484; ff49de5707b7cf1ab2e3efd8336a8e0ba6c5d30d; 2c0f1fc88b25e5a5fbddef1f9969e4e38a841242; 60e3c567a4102d7708bc948c29b44180eb573706; 6ab770fc2db4cc8cf1c4ab9e43cb873a4d5d85b2; dde95ad96d236c81acfcfe797faca9d5541fadba; 031a31a5f85689bbdbbc53183691daceb7eccfbc; 0b2e68e4b03cf9eefd23247b91c74259ea50f9f4; fbe359b17229246717e417ca8995c4478a235262; e00edde692f0fbd29e4b4ea632f408ada7dc614f; 409c36227acf862cd75af895dc3aaa442a44b002; ca27e43cef750e579f35d3cf57c6ab2cc31f6d5d; f83e0230ccd6f9840a4568f4ede719ed71e782e3; 8231d7680a2ac16d0fd6b011feaefa167aefa7a3; d02618605d0a81024319aaecda0e260ff398d8c1; c30d33af76812d5515c3e2561bda9ec1adc48ac7; b13d9061433c01a8f92f4137ded12a6f603ed123; ed761e329a81e76826231901581433c6c695d01d; 10da29ff11b5fa023f5b9f611a3f4685e47c7483; 177631bc99d2f378fa2a9e0982961a144c3c117c; 1364295b5f9519c7925fd154d0e2caff6e14c6f7; 7c69197d2171f68e1a49f893d7c19dde79c7f1e9; 3baa9ad345042b759d174b9f5d9c79cecc0f49e2; 428c957a3880fe4fa1bb98d7d47eeb4d997498b1; ec94b475417f454cac8d3d3488373ea418452b16; 45e646f212101fa9bd39864dc99fed15c2cfcfce; bdcb753730aece79bcdeaebe983caac1f12e72ff; 43945f183bbbb6e4d7ff0de746ceb3c281f52d9e; f6d2a422acaeb583a0a24b5e12366f73449912f5; 5e0c3220b23818a3286418ea407e8c2a9788009f; 059234e9d47d305954204114a291c783ddf4131c; 57b241d4744607dbb2750ba216e2a573859ec144; 972ceba28c05b2ee38b61f9d254041a9534da847; 27fe18fe99c30dfca6fd4eb9214fa9efe910bfae,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,11,

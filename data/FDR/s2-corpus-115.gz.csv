bb50e191373f931f9131521b12ea1d16377341fb,FDR control under block dependence,"ABSTRACT In practical settings such as microarray data analysis, multiple hypotheses with dependence within but not between equal-sized blocks often need to be tested. We consider an adaptive BH procedure to test the hypotheses. Under the condition of positive regression dependence on a subset of the true null hypotheses, the proposed adaptive procedure is shown to control the false discovery rate. The proposed approach is compared to the existing methods in simulation under block dependence and totally uniform pairwise dependence. It is observed that the proposed method performs better than the existing methods in several situations.",2017,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Haibing Zhao"", ids = ""37950585""); list(name = ""Wing Kam Fung"", ids = ""153900594"")",,156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 1629449886d68f1c020446d3cb9c3e94f3abd6b5; 9bf0123dca62945783a55a99d712e93357a38539; f8fdba9c7e718793981f32d0fc298a2702f1ede7; 297729649e7cc13fb54880ac4cf49ef89dfd72a7; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation,46,6468 - 6474
8140a458f382eeea1616b041147c26b1169f114f,A new method for estimating the number of non-differentially expressed genes.,"Control of the false discovery rate is a statistical method that is widely used when identifying differentially expressed genes in high-throughput sequencing assays. It is often calculated using an adaptive linear step-up procedure in which the number of non-differentially expressed genes should be estimated accurately. In this paper, we discuss the estimation of this parameter and point out defects in the original estimation method. We also propose a new estimation method and provide the error estimation. We compared the estimation results from the two methods in a simulation study that produced a mean, standard deviation, range, and root mean square error. The results revealed that there was little difference in the mean between the two methods, but the standard deviation, range, and root mean square error obtained using the new method were much smaller than those produced by the original method, which indicates that the new method is more accurate and robust. Furthermore, we used real microarray data to verify the conclusion. Finally we provide a suggestion when analyzing differentially expressed genes using statistical methods.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jin-dan Wu"", ids = ""5056506""); list(name = ""Chenhui Liu"", ids = ""2196891""); list(name = ""Wenying Chen"", ids = ""47482852""); list(name = ""Wuning Ma"", ids = ""48632871""); list(name = ""Yitao Ding"", ids = ""144780816"")",b8e2e3348cce5fe9f11627109db273f6a51a9aee,89a0e8707e15d0861c72be59853a9e61395c696d; 94727da03edc11fca584137cabeadf2f0f575cfa; 447bf5edc72aa9b8c96f841ff11e8f47e89d2ec4; f7653c8510b826ac54c8e4cdfcd557b009bb672f; edbdd4d8c8698d538836bb5abffd37b432033d05; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; 890948490892f4fbac75095f093d7db6b1d2f08c; e8fbe7200e8d697689e0d2a274358508e170c51f; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; 142142aee0e49b566851c6cac9aee0366ea54a52; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 55507aba54a92b31a200e8112f088f5c356ed7bc; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 2544949c65e5bf3898df558375b72cda49d83ccc; 2d03f13272d0b57b7395edd3861a6d759f85f0f6; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 490463ce5e1bceb8a703ea0d333bab35478366d8; 2c76eed9af9eaeacc6a015c97a5e37c68604c3ee; b5860253e015c27e8b125cf9b7ba2cb543dc36ed; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; 5273867e23f40e0f9c3f8372761ffb8e2649f00f; 2cd8dc8fe9e89af280eef7e5b00cecd73e564da9; 4bda5ad9b87c44870349622791ba464b454bc886,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,15 1,
e1ccfa13b7c6dde5b8805536d229e7e1b85e5078,A novel cognitive assessment paradigm to detect Pre-mild cognitive impairment (PreMCI) and the relationship to biological markers of Alzheimer's disease.,"OBJECTIVE
A number of older adults obtain normal scores on formal cognitive tests, but present clinical concerns that raise suspicion of cognitive decline. Despite not meeting full criteria for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), these PreMCI states confer risk for progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD). This investigation addressed a pressing need to identify cognitive measures that are sensitive to PreMCI and are associated with brain biomarkers of neurodegeneration.


METHOD
Participants included 49 older adults with a clinical history suggestive of cognitive decline but normal scores on an array of neuropsychological measures, thus not meeting formal criteria for MCI. The performance of these PreMCI participants were compared to 117 cognitively normal (CN) elders on the LASSI-L, a cognitive stress test that uniquely assesses the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference effects (frPSI). Finally, a subset of these individuals had volumetric analyses based on MRI scans.


RESULTS
PreMCI participants evidenced greater LASSI- L deficits, particularly with regards to frPSI and delayed recall, relative to the CN group. No differences on MRI measures were observed. Controlling for false discovery rate (FDR), frPSI was uniquely related to increased dilatation of the inferior lateral ventricle and decreased MRI volumes in the hippocampus, precuneus, superior parietal region, and other AD prone areas. In contrast, other LASSI-L indices and standard memory tests were not related to volumetric findings.


CONCLUSIONS
Despite equivalent performance on traditional memory measures, the frPSI distinguished between PreMCI and CN elders and was associated with reductions in brain volume in numerous AD-relevant brain regions.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Elizabeth A.

9732be2d1043a6fa045e817d03ea9cc978446293,Immune Gene Expression Is Associated with Genomic Aberrations in Breast Cancer.,"The presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is a favorable prognostic factor in breast cancer, but what drives immune infiltration remains unknown. Here we examine if clonal heterogeneity, total mutation load, neoantigen load, copy number variations (CNV), gene- or pathway-level somatic mutations, or germline polymorphisms (SNP) are associated with immune metagene expression in breast cancer subtypes. Thirteen published immune metagenes correlated separately with genomic metrics in the three major breast cancer subtypes. We analyzed RNA-Seq, DNA copy number, mutation and germline SNP data of 627 ER+, 207 HER2+, and 191 triple-negative (TNBC) cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas. P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons, and permutation testing was used to assess false discovery rates. Increased immune metagene expression associated significantly with lower clonal heterogeneity estimated by MATH score in all subtypes and with a trend for lower overall mutation, neoantigen, and CNV loads in TNBC and HER2+ cancers. In ER+ cancers, mutation load, neoantigen load, and CNV load weakly but positively associated with immune infiltration, which reached significance for overall mutation load only. No highly recurrent single gene or pathway level mutations associated with immune infiltration. High immune gene expression and lower clonal heterogeneity in TNBC and HER2+ cancers suggest an immune pruning effect and equilibrium between immune surveillance and clonal expansion. Thus, immune checkpoint inhibitors may tip the balance in favor of immune surveillance in these cancers. Cancer Res; 77(12); 3317-24.

e465cc7c4cd88910da8aa105cd571e308d5967f1,MAGIC: an automated N-linked glycoprotein identification tool using a Y1-ion pattern matching algorithm and in silico MSÂ² approach.,"Glycosylation is a highly complex modification influencing the functions and activities of proteins. Interpretation of intact glycopeptide spectra is crucial but challenging. In this paper, we present a mass spectrometry-based automated glycopeptide identification platform (MAGIC) to identify peptide sequences and glycan compositions directly from intact N-linked glycopeptide collision-induced-dissociation spectra. The identification of the Y1 (peptideY0 + GlcNAc) ion is critical for the correct analysis of unknown glycoproteins, especially without prior knowledge of the proteins and glycans present in the sample. To ensure accurate Y1-ion assignment, we propose a novel algorithm called Trident that detects a triplet pattern corresponding to [Y0, Y1, Y2] or [Y0-NH3, Y0, Y1] from the fragmentation of the common trimannosyl core of N-linked glycopeptides. To facilitate the subsequent peptide sequence identification by common database search engines, MAGIC generates in silico spectra by overwriting the original precursor with the naked peptide m/z and removing all of the glycan-related ions. Finally, MAGIC computes the glycan compositions and ranks them. For the model glycoprotein horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a 5-glycoprotein mixture, a 2- to 31-fold increase in the relative intensities of the peptide fragments was achieved, which led to the identification of 7 tryptic glycopeptides from HRP and 16 glycopeptides from the mixture via Mascot. In the HeLa cell proteome data set, MAGIC processed over a thousand MS(2) spectra in 3 min on a PC and reported 36 glycopeptides from 26 glycoproteins. Finally, a remarkable false discovery rate of 0 was achieved on the N-glycosylation-free Escherichia coli data set.

We tested for trait loci associated with body weight, height, and bison mass index; BMI while controlling for estimated ancestry to reduce potential confounding effects due to population admixture in 1316 bison sampled from 4 U.S. herds. We used 60 microsatellite markers to model each phenotype as a function of herd, sex, age, marker genotypes, and individual ancestry estimates. Statistical significance for genotype and its interaction with ancestry was evaluated using the adaptive false discovery rate. Of the four herds, two appeared to be admixed and two were non-admixed. Although none of the main effects of the loci were significant, estimated ancestry and its interaction with marker loci were significantly associated with the phenotypes, illustrating the importance of including ancestry in the models and the dependence of genotype-phenotype associations on background ancestry.

Associations between obesity-related phenotypes and four genes in these pathways - leptin (LEP), leptin receptor (LEPR), neuropeptide Y2 receptor (NPY2R) and peptide YY (PYY) were examined in CARDIA Study participants (aged 18-30 at recruitment in 1985-6). Weight, BMI and waist circumference were measured at baseline and at years 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20. Genotyping was conducted using tag SNPs characterising common genetic variations in these genes. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models estimated associations between SNPs and repeated anthropometric measurements, controlling for sex and age. False discovery rate was used to adjust for multiple testing. In African-Americans, SNPs across the LEP gene demonstrated significant overall associations with all obesity-related phenotypes. The associations between LEP rs17151919 with weight tended to strengthen with time - the difference in weight associated with each additional minor allele increased from 2.6 kg at baseline to 4.8 kg at year 20 (SNP*time interaction p = 0.0193). NPY2R gene SNPs were associated with waist circumference among African-American men (p = 0.0462). In Caucasians, LEP SNPs also tended to be associated with weight (p = 0.0471), and PYY rs11684664 was associated with obesity-related phenotypes in women only (p = 0.010-0.026). Several LEP, and NPY2R and PYY SNPs were associated with obesity-related phenotypes in young adults, particularly among African-Americans.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yechiel Friedlander"", ids = ""4934031""); list(name = ""Guo Li"", ids = ""145521879""); list(name = ""Myriam Fornage"", ids = ""2573222""); list(name = ""O.

7eea9593084d00dfdcff1f0df48eacf99520a1a7,Associations of high-altitude polycythemia with polymorphisms in PIK3CD and COL4A3 in Tibetan populations,"BackgroundHigh-altitude polycythemia (HAPC) is a chronic high-altitude disease that can lead to an increase in the production of red blood cells in the people who live in the plateau, a hypoxia environment, for a long time. The most frequent symptoms of HAPC include headache, dizziness, breathlessness, sleep disorders, and dilation of veins. Although chronic hypoxia is the main cause of HAPC, the fundamental pathophysiologic process and related molecular mechanisms responsible for its development remain largely unclear yet.Aim/methodsThis study aimed to explore the related hereditary factors of HAPC in the Chinese Han and Tibetan populations. A total of 140 patients (70 Han and 70 Tibetan) with HAPC and 60 healthy control subjects (30 Han and 30 Tibetan) were recruited for a case-control association study. To explore the genetic basis of HAPC, we investigated the association between HAPC and both phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphonate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit delta gene (PIK3CD) and collagen type IV Î±3 chain gene (COL4A3) in Chinese Han and Tibetan populations.Results/conclusionUsing the unconditional logistic regression analysis and the false discovery rate (FDR) calculation, we found that eight SNPs in PIK3CD and one SNP in COL4A3 were associated with HAPC in the Tibetan population. However, in the Han population, we did not find any significant association. Our study suggested that polymorphisms in the PIK3CD and COL4A3 were correlated with susceptibility to HAPC in the Tibetan population.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Xiaowei Fan"", ids = ""49537241""); list(name = ""Lifeng Ma"", ids = ""47687112""); list(name = ""Zhiying Zhang"", ids = ""2481026""); list(name = ""Yi Li"", ids = ""37340608""); list(name = ""Meng Hao"", ids = ""48324307""); list(name = ""Zhipeng Zhao"", ids = ""50144868""); list(name = ""Yiduo Zhao"", ids = ""18080532""); list(name = ""Fang Liu"", ids = ""47185625""); list(name = ""Lijun Liu"", ids = ""51038980""); list(name = ""Xingguang Luo"", ids = ""4420816""); list(name = ""Peng Cai"", ids = ""143671078""); list(name = ""Yansong Li"", ids = ""2126364""); list(name = ""Longli Kang"", ids = ""38996032"")",70d708be6e33b70436d5f8dc658ca2ecdcdba25f; c1cfd3d008e2247980fa59772dd1e8c02563b6ce,e11b8337f7c38623f27508238d3d4e57a55e526e; bfe6c0869b2e127a06547c442cea0b80555a2f69; 07060900d43f96e2d24885858ceaad054b6902b1; 47d3e9fb5d451362eeee33340f6e0dfe68522004; 5a41fdbbd1ae1e968bccdccd83dd9e3c4ee4f0aa; 8b2779695f544b42f48106d6b37444f40a520725; e67990f286b76e8e2a1a8df6ddb109c8f1a19a42; cefcbe373119645ab0af02c2de7a412e9c07c933; 9f0af0a9912b5d035bbc1f874e59baaa7f71bcac; d3462f2e5e48de0061f48c3a47066b1a203a414d; 91f77560b9d11cf1047ff974fe77f5deefa299cc; ee8594eef00b97a2940dbe5f08317f9bc11b27b7; 5a33cb176cb4c982b5e0fde3ff2c843767599664; cbf06caae21bcc7217820a42b22cbb4d3094415d; 4c512286efabf2e5e313fbad531902754f9863d8; 2e1614fafe9f54ee9feb98c551f70b4d8d188d3a; 4f68282ae3d560f05a3bcff402066956245542f3; 830850d892756f25372bd17880edda3491af8d59; 8cc84efa20e292d1983d39295cc1dac4549c2774; 75c317fcdcf3c036b00348ca889ac1273fb7f416; 1ac79916542f5037493ec7895381b4d423284a00; 02e137ccbe6cb7898032dbe8a753684eca1eba9e; 0ce69ecf1645e8031d1dff9172db7cdb2872b634; eddc36041b73b2354e2b51dd6beed4f5848db319; 701e32d2bc4e817efdefcd55e5dc1ac477b5e798; 9920a667ebbed7a5f0191a00b44916f22c788fc9; 009b04540e2222f8573c6eef39af3efbc18cb10d; 4c4946432f39c3916a7fce462d26f42a185241f4; eb8039fd561b179169f3242ceb01316881369273; 33150d7d001f163a4c69c472a621fc5baa977789; 757b6595d6aa641ead5b16d660658a7616833512; 2c526bb993f9bac15bf0ba86ad8bc6ee81dfef78; 6046b09f78171dce80575fa904d1b4d08dc98207; 80cc1581026a7597a4e32a136aa9c61196e3268f; d65c2bdc215494b9c3b3f38ed958c3ccb392d68e; 5f986bc30bf22236ecd32d7969963b13b84757db; 2facd29fcc5badbda3eb6841d3bda8c813473496; f46ea254aadf5311eaab6fd29a1b17b9321871ad; 66c139cc09aab32829edc7b6fdff2fed6bb8b432,Human Genomics,12,
5d5319e1133ee105d83e07da567ee288b7851d09,Alterations of the human gut microbiome in liver cirrhosis,"Liver cirrhosis occurs as a consequence of many chronic liver diseases that are prevalent worldwide. Here we characterize the gut microbiome in liver cirrhosis by comparing 98 patients and 83 healthy control individuals. We build a reference gene set for the cohort containing 2.69Â million genes, 36.1% of which are novel. Quantitative metagenomics reveals 75,245 genes that differ in abundance between the patients and healthy individuals (false discovery rateÂ <Â 0.0001) and can be grouped into 66 clusters representing cognate bacterial species; 28 are enriched in patients and 38 in control individuals. Most (54%) of the patient-enriched, taxonomically assigned species are of buccal origin, suggesting an invasion of the gut from the mouth in liver cirrhosis. Biomarkers specific to liver cirrhosis at gene and function levels are revealed by a comparison with those for type 2 diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. On the basis of only 15 biomarkers, a highly accurate patient discrimination index is created and validated on an independent cohort. Thus microbiota-targeted biomarkers may be a powerful tool for diagnosis of different diseases.",2014,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Nan Qin"", ids = ""40530934""); list(name = ""Fengling Yang"", ids = ""4577249""); list(name = ""Ang Li"", ids = ""5475446""); list(name = ""Edi Prifti"", ids = ""2574393""); list(name = ""Yanfei Chen"", ids = ""7377227""); list(name = ""Li Shao"", ids = ""152146679""); list(name = ""Jing Guo"", ids = ""153016778""); list(name = ""Emmanuelle Le Chatelier"", ids = ""5057223""); list(name = ""Jian Yao"", ids = ""114689671""); list(name = ""Lingjiao Wu"", ids = ""47767570""); list(name = ""Jiawei Zhou"", ids = ""7934800""); list(name = ""Shujun Ni"", ids = ""4652236""); list(name = ""Lin Liu"", ids = ""46458045""); list(name = ""Nicolas Pons"", ids = ""144559524""); list(name = ""Jean-Michel Batto"", ids = ""4528171""); list(name = ""Sean P.

c0af985eb8b920deb434f56b96eee02b62719df7,A generalized framework for controlling FDR in gene regulatory network inference,"Motivation Inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from perturbation data can give detailed mechanistic insights of a biological system. Many inference methods exist, but the resulting GRN is generally sensitive to the choice of methodâ€specific parameters. Even though the inferred GRN is optimal given the parameters, many links may be wrong or missing if the data is not informative. To make GRN inference reliable, a method is needed to estimate the support of each predicted link as the method parameters are varied. Results To achieve this we have developed a method called nested bootstrapping, which applies a bootstrapping protocol to GRN inference, and by repeated bootstrap runs assesses the stability of the estimated support values. To translate bootstrap support values to false discovery rates we run the same pipeline with shuffled data as input. This provides a general method to control the false discovery rate of GRN inference that can be applied to any setting of inference parameters, noise level, or data properties. We evaluated nested bootstrapping on a simulated dataset spanning a range of such properties, using the LASSO, Least Squares, RNI, GENIE3 and CLR inference methods. An improved inference accuracy was observed in almost all situations. Nested bootstrapping was incorporated into the GeneSPIDER package, which was also used for generating the simulated networks and data, as well as running and analyzing the inferences.

2e382bc4d42c0fa121760e003ac51a7e2dd5fad0,An empirical Bayes testing procedure for detecting variants in analysis of next generation sequencing data,"Because of the decreasing cost and high digital resolution, nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) is expected to replace the traditional hybridization-based microarray technology. For genetics study, the first-step analysis of NGS data is often to identify genomic variants among sequenced samples. Several statistical models and tests have been developed for variant calling in NGS study. The existing approaches, however, are based on either conventional Bayesian or frequentist methods, which are unable to address the multiplicity and testing efficiency issues simultaneously. In this paper, we derive an optimal empirical Bayes testing procedure to detect variants for NGS study. We utilize the empirical Bayes technique to exploit the across-site information among many testing sites in NGS data. We prove that our testing procedure is valid and optimal in the sense of rejecting the maximum number of nonnulls while the Bayesian false discovery rate is controlled at a given nominal level. We show by both simulation studies and real data analysis that our testing efficiency can be greatly enhanced over the existing frequentist approaches that fail to pool and utilize information across the multiple testing sites.",2013,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Zhigen Zhao"", ids = ""2941525""); list(name = ""Wei Wang"", ids = ""46314607""); list(name = ""Zhi Wei"", ids = ""145312585"")",d49346b2cde9ff433123405cc2e7a7e22ca2e444; 3e52b68b6d34bc5d28144ad3ea8de5acfd5660b3; 08dcbec1b8d05b6ed7fa9f3320f707b120bd9ce8; d230806f7501767944153c4f04a8c0016601c566; 4b0fc8d0a5cc1cc9d5fcda75deb56dd84e948d75; afb8de17fa56e549223421505323a8b5333cb177; 8d9b6a995ea9950dd0d94869991b3a6651cd2f18,377f5c10a833d596741ff486ad093b8e3d067049; bc103d96366ec97e0dd620894bbb04c8849eb772; 5cf49df88b4efcdbfe5f1bf2b72ec7f7e6d95b08; 28d42057021588c787f44f30b37a1bf1f398ab3d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 0bfe13f43b483d72436c341b9bd37c0696c51604; a4e5cdf2d314fa87dbc45de692ffd7965c93a259; b4da5cc2676b86904a898490fc1c0a86906983d8; 0e68beebb4c7ccbd9d3b410b84481ae48908d029; 3071090dedc008438afe0b27428d084c9734d52b; 390eb9cf1695db75b29d1e0b3eee70eda3062e68; af17c4d43033be816d0be0b8f434b3d6d58463ab; d69142471f174a0bbda395f47233d6cfd1cc6155; 0b1df01f2fed42b69e2abfec7e841eb7570cefd4; f8fdba9c7e718793981f32d0fc298a2702f1ede7; 6d962648c4c48b1004197d8e93e7fb04bcc64597; 507ea84199e2f47e3e6e98133eb028749937fd3e; 6381055e94eafc1b44bc02f3e70973df26079b7c; 28a215515d10b0ccadef846c61894e2e8a4ff65a; 86dd743c8408f216a3b40f47a9236872cd433423; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 34f5670b6c193c9bb719bfa70b1ea00e5aed55a2; 88bd70c7a924f36f51fdfadae279710fb4ba109f; 19b3b088a286f72970a4dabd338e631eaa59b1e5; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; a68281d003c345f86a14785f249f251609b176f3; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 000551662c3902ed66709be879053d95dafc0211; c0d361344070a3d739f8d67e418f34805cd557b7; bbff6a05c3ca06a92bc643d7808b0b793a1c0638; 2446ff36818d62c8851e39bef95da9c02235388a; af702ae271d11cd6759ce25efefd33bb0b370ffd; 7f957067fb7993b364f562a5592c2d5c78852fee; 3b8f5a4ad1915881230aad39204e5a0a5f2fae45; 2c0cdd08a8d3cb834da33515037eafa4bdb5faff; ca726d368271b3d637c78c9b2983c267a7c91e2b; f4098703626399ca1f9b41675b736104678d05ad; 9bb910631a8e126401cde7c2919d2f9966259126; da40ef5e864348135bdcd55e3bd0a205f637af93; e9c7c7c07166a7b296ea8a2e1b8a4cdaa009f89d; 0a8051b00cb24e07d605473d815845281148a7bb; c1dc19f87fa83b4357f0557cbb6c32a4ee0002d7; b83e96720100c2b399b75cee2a75f7e0e45b5499; 9288d828fa29f9be5dd86f1b1705fab3c7abd473; 36b52aca35c2fc8c8d03d898eec68ddbff5de49b; 30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98; 47774e9ac7ef9601024d2d9717a2869024af7a6b; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; a759777f7c4d59bd43f870d98f618ac09ad66fa3; c6387b2679fc3b793ee8b3d9d2e96035dfbc5609; 10c9cf8c08d3f521560ac44ba8888a454e86b6ca; c61bf7414278ad46459990f68100375ae4639bdb; aed910e065d5449d5357861fd25b7881ce04d87e; 530a835a6e2199fd964f32fe9c2c1532fe93ea62; d5a9e34dc5aab352cddde7f7e556fa2627084a4a; 59d10aa27664579481fc7882c6cd681b4add7ed7; a12a69d740e8e405d6bea5f583fe8c561311d97d; a10550875f61598e6bddaf8fcea7b5bf8db204c5,The Annals of Applied Statistics,7,2229-2248
e77e6f48338d32db5f729ca740ea45be48593ca5,Metabolomics reveals significant variations in metabolites and correlations regarding the maturation of walnuts (Juglans regia L.),"The content of walnut metabolites is related to its nutritive value and physiological characteristics, however, comprehensive information concerning the metabolome of walnut kernels is limited. In this study we analyzed the metabolites of walnut kernels at five developmental stages from filling to ripening using GC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics; of a total 252 peaks identified, 85 metabolites were positively identified. Further statistical analysis revealed that these 85 metabolites covered different types of metabolism pathways. PCA scores revealed that the metabolic compositions of the embryo are different at each stage, while the metabolic composition of the endotesta could not be significantly separated into distinct groups. Additionally, 7225 metabolite-metabolite correlations were detected in walnut kernel by a Pearson correlation coefficient approach; during screening of the calculated correlations, 463 and 1047 were determined to be significant with r(2)â‰¥0.49 and had a false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤0.05 in endotesta and embryo, respectively. This work provides the first comprehensive metabolomic study of walnut kernels and reveals that most of the carbohydrate and protein-derived carbon was transferred into other compounds, such as fatty acids, during the maturation of walnuts, which may potentially provide the basis for further studies on walnut kernel metabolism.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Guodong Rao"", ids = ""144204130""); list(name = ""Jinkai Sui"", ids = ""24332527""); list(name = ""Jianguo Zhang"", ids = ""47538857"")",3beaca84e321a2bea32d11b58366ce21309efa7f; 07cdf049489c68dee8af376050aaff165e7a8ae2; 218de51cb884d785b5ff58a911cf7eaa5cc5f061; c896cfa813f9fc8f6affa909501221558825e3f7; 98130725a89a48a339993da234e52a4f127b5eed; 4686c052de8a638ec77a2c458c69e3f7014d9624; 2c50526fce29d0b86eb122bfa8ba525392e5fe58; ede784b680be0c4030d12525d900bef6b2ec77ab; 96d280b7af5decb1f8c57d697e19c036e6b82a45; bfe5045f32e761e783b078db2fd57c4e82279a46; 21d9cec26daa2a94d2d963c4d2dfa82ba0d51ed5; 8655a37eb681cd401d6eb221dc2dec0870acd781; eed2a4b3305ad36679c629f374d7628586522eb0,222b5b859bf2972cf7b74b1af5c1301a2c83a701; dcb53c470f5e58a40a5b9466822c6a67d4f4b8b3; 947a2e54e8ccf68bcc6fd5f0359ae73bff7080d1; f2a1c2d42af845ebbf867a1e274b1a48d6e015b0; 3df392a8bd123e58530411221fab9574240835ad; 6d8dba4dea1473c39e6b0125d7f0e0077890164a; f6e064c369800fb30b25be6cdbf8290b598eafa8; 74d3f1fe75c62c30d983745266cd74c112b23983; 46d2be2e7befc9c86a2d34f39e95de3596123a40; a66a0ef7ea99e78a0ecdf0cc453a8477e5b0ed83; 7cd4448dfda5ac68a42d6821cd14c6c920e4d9df; 62ce080639cf0fc47b61ce5239a43228e4f83bfe; bc605b3cc44e28728d7470e0f0dc9e6a8f0093e4; 9f5e9a44d887a95b579cf34b03c6dc6e757c748b; 114701141cfe03c020f0e2d2eb0b759b1c991faa; a77fbed88f06d101c3e69af6987245816285d0d4; a42502f85eaaea302f64e18ed88bdd96d8b3c142; f7f7ebf26e01cd308a070d1e7f55dec5e747cb02; 9b9fd542fb4f2dbf53a22f70ae48908b60038397; 5e6a1221dbb6699b1189a8c6b8eaa46be01555c2; e3479db7a3d93a6522abc0e75e3de9464874335a; 2e08f336931dc8e9f0880da3999a2aade3ee781e; 15178064866854c62cf606309b64f53300ce9097; bfc792b952b60e3b9554a4cdb9e6fe0158878cd0; 439322df73078af68dca0ead20ac2d677337a082; 81de4c19c6feeea155d052c814967c972e5a9220; 90fed400486471d6528edf46a4abc15bf97117e8; 05351c452807e906e5c3995df76fb3c14ab8d8a1; be2364395b2af1565574ef6fc6bed797a3012380; 8781b586a5982278861038ee41783e79a75edd3f; 93e43a83f2ef7ce3737604c2f425b7c912a74317; 4cd99cfb6bf196897b3943a357ef95d425bb0f01; 6ac58771abe88a1dec4bf924e00221838baaf0b4; 6c8d3b943138d0c26ba836fa893354fa91969129; b66c8b21e1b50baac22b9f35ddf81d7f3f39b8d0; 9a925776742cd198b67a6030c93301843881d000; 5679326e901c8f55a9c3b629f82180eab9c56aca,Biology Open,5,829 - 836
847a1bc2abe7917f22741606d32d67b73b90050f,Enhanced Network Efficiency of Functional Brain Networks in Primary Insomnia Patients,"Accumulating evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that primary insomnia (PI) affects interregional neural coordination of multiple interacting functional brain networks. However, a complete understanding of the whole-brain network organization from a system-level perspective in PI is still lacking. To this end, we investigated in topological organization changes in brain functional networks in PI. 36 PI patients and 38 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls were recruited. All participants underwent a series of neuropsychological assessments and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Individual whole-brain functional network were constructed and analyzed using graph theory-based network approaches. There were no significant differences with respect to age, sex, or education between groups (Pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). Graph-based analyses revealed that participants with PI had a significantly higher total number of edges (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.022), global efficiency (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.014), and normalized global efficiency (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002), and a significantly lower normalized local efficiency (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.042) compared with controls. Locally, several prefrontal and parietal regions, the superior temporal gyrus, and the thalamus exhibited higher nodal efficiency in participants with PI (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, false discovery rate corrected). In addition, most of these regions showed increased functional connectivity in PI patients (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, corrected). Finally, altered network efficiency was correlated with neuropsychological variables of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Insomnia Severity Index in patients with PI. PI is associated with abnormal organization of large-scale functional brain networks, which may account for memory and emotional dysfunction in people with PI. These findings provide novel implications for neural substrates associated with PI.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaofen Ma"", ids = ""7832377""); list(name = ""Guihua Jiang"", ids = ""145917573""); list(name = ""Shishun Fu"", ids = ""32261583""); list(name = ""Jin Fang"", ids = ""145791861""); list(name = ""Yunfan Wu"", ids = ""6573612""); list(name = ""Mengchen Liu"", ids = ""145823303""); list(name = ""Guang Ying Xu"", ids = ""49560124""); list(name = ""Tianyue Wang"", ids = ""3352577"")",f720a92c53aedb9267715381e95e2961392fd471; b12c320d51b73a06a3f1d2ef2e44cfbaa4ccef12; ad72903b26c5bd0760c4c6828ceff51eb416e83d; 99cbc126bdd39bc9ac33084c38ae6c323aef3945,a8a18497987e8b4715cba7cd6d2f8e6a1d58b2fa; 455ffc43df6816bbf4241362f5efe3a67ffcfbdc; 33987fd0f8faa4d2d10a64926399ee4189b19f54; efec0df91e255bedb0b32ea2fd51ecdf617b41f1; d56c0f8b3f4f8e98e78e67a8e147ed674003de4d; cf1113fd0ba60d1c3a185a746b74be79cbb3680d; cf18bb16dfc82286c3d8bf5aa8775c4b3da7ad7c; da3b5a53502ab45858344ae9050f8d57e155df40; 2bf6a2699847d065f7ce87de03d089b3be64f8d7; 2177792671c8537309167c54b3e3c4f2dcfece52; 5be53d9403338f5eb8bc027f075e7a481b5eb62d; e7712fd0dfe1fe54eb7f3f021ace37ffeeb7881a; 0afd6f7dd95b9ff4f9315e6bc42e020474ab2a85; 04c078b471b51ec48e248eab48b97649e1e965de; c3aab481fcb1c84acafeb34215b7af09078cae3a; 0559515bb6c9abe90d80e32e2bb58e6e7f7a4bd8; 7950b9e6541e3291f4b9fb858d76e475c93b4bdd; f857c563e9d7842492ccdd4c01f616745a0e13a0; 5450286f88458a86720149a2c61e52ae33701a9b; 6889e5a22598521d8af5bbc50d5dd44b2cde92a4; 6c64889a707a15702f0abb047be5cd14d8a3dfb4; 8311a4df3a7502b73c4faa2e7bf746d12c0dfd82; 2f689cfa8ce23efa836ca0e9a5da2449bb06e085; b466feeb3f5c6080a7bd931dc3a62463327bb28e; be0adfea42acc755693e8d95291997201bc6c248; ddfb014761b5293d68914df8a0ad8b2e5af23438; 19c378c544769db3a2fdf51943db599ebacb2b6e; 88d5f63af893be00ab021f918e944f58f5f04abe; 1d187161f4415f6344d48d5394faecb036636ccb; 313a17c8b7095773e64a8968fee4fb789a2a1c65; 75c2f465d59739dbc06b70fd34dc3c1b2336103e; f88a9978a548236c4317e7f51e63eff48e6d003f; 2c12b48de1eae2e7b497a7c5d7320af614bc9c08; dba25c91f669a600ec6aa8c2483ec6ce9c3a26c0; 1b87d889c143f23132ea748559f124b52fc06cb2; 894b7897dc2143c5e8db666766cf59637a7c7b82; 68a2a41e2f339f69b7447a698d24fd40dae0da06; ee5e589b92a711bb6a627adf6662c82cf62ad28c; c2112c57362c089fe951d96dbf8d58fced14defa; 3c86c1dc61a4b616481c699e831e3bfc6a3492ce; 98496732a841a5702f7e56776b06edba5f175205; 60befb26744715e2a1aab68a73d43b2beb028ef0; 1c74f4dee2ea4b95e7493355c5b99734b9ea9213; b55dfb180030e51e280c5660e7351bbaee7d2d19; 67ab606526f914d474b88ffb9c95a28de38aab52; 41162156a1faa4fc2d81bdd7ecd8486ef911ea20; 03987b3672faf2b05325639a2a306a219a2a8709; 73acdc6070053b4e8ed287c12cd9ac5d2e497420; 82c59d8545ba71acb1cee29865591d2d63e1d28d; ed378bd55ba7300285f911a49b7889dcca83900b; 860f22a009723d40b7410d660a43cc42ebca8561; d2dbc320dddf6952ee20447c323d487018840253; 745e37345472bce18c8519b392a5e36cc7e7448d; 94ecb7aa2c45fd0d48f566d3b62ff9b6e69899e8; 070ec1baa4d74fe63b7c6c450487e851e2523a36; 5c0008ecfda26872227965fd3633463a2bd3dd5b; 832b106c5019c57986e1409434c28007667d9d5b; e2a100e76445c974edc4a797cd759baeb5b2544e; 72af55f3e9c0ced51066eca606808a5145e27a53; a11e1d22de59c3ee8428ba432d9136bc493f84a6; ff46705eabbd307d92fc472978e6164363b9cc1f; 34318cbd1e05108dc47d38dcaff19ed055fa4271; 165fd770b8893f8511852d44f4d4ac7241eebeeb; 0d7663f65bb9bdd58dd7e833a972dea03cb6dbdf; bdca4176a6cc2d285605c439843ae42a4331e1f1; 9472e000cdc7cecd7cbee5620cc08d839df170a5; fcf562f2e825cc61cee78316541ec558dd295503; d948f1cf686f4d17b627dba7a654065aacc748a0; 8e2d66404f39833902f8334cb0d650b71f9ae177; 62a978d168bba9d5de5a3705f24cfe315f913745; 709925c305df901d9c19ac9f76c3704ae734e3f0; 97d58a1e54ccfa51803e440c410d0e13cd0e691c; dc917618f0fccd8de1bae5be5f8ac588b7410b39; 301f2bcb4236225bdf8862fd55ba28667008fa77; db12f18cbfe38263bee7dacb3cfa61cc53d32b3c; f054cd8e9728201ac55c535bcb57b04816a0c172; 600dc829ddc63b3e231d51a1826eae338f731c16; 110fc89934aa58f59580adecd1f317c4a3e75f7e; 0f8c8decd69c46dfa83e03ac94b272d07ca619b5; f525726c68f41569ceac7e05c8ab654ff65e2872; 49e281f64dcd6c43d3b664955cd164daa59253b6; 98561ce73e014931b9f753ae8cb664decbd17c2c; c6309b2aa8706f69b70830ef18147c79be36ba50; 7305989fcba20f07209f6d7eae43c6756f67cb8f; dbe0f162a51467b8077791a63982eab36e85850a; d61031326150ba23f90e6587c13d99188209250e; 0ff505d471ab00ea9b8789b9a26db20bf74936de,Frontiers in Psychiatry,9,
23ae804bc440e322d29c9017258ae058edd0491b,Identification of novel cellular targets in biliary tract cancers using global gene expression technology.,"Biliary tract carcinoma carries a poor prognosis, and difficulties with clinical management in patients with advanced disease are often due to frequent late-stage diagnosis, lack of serum markers, and limited information regarding biliary tumor pathogenesis. RNA-based global analyses of gene expression have led to the identification of a large number of up-regulated genes in several cancer types. We have used the recently developed Affymetrix U133A gene expression microarrays containing nearly 22,000 unique transcripts to obtain global gene expression profiles from normal biliary epithelial scrapings (n = 5), surgically resected biliary carcinomas (n = 11), and biliary cancer cell lines (n = 9). Microarray hybridization data were normalized using dCHIP (http://www.dCHIP.org) to identify differentially up-regulated genes in primary biliary cancers and biliary cancer cell lines and their expression profiles was compared to that of normal epithelial scrapings using the dCHIP software as well as Significance Analysis of Microarrays or SAM (http://www-stat.stanford.edu/ approximately tibs/SAM/). Comparison of the dCHIP and SAM datasets revealed an overlapping list of 282 genes expressed at greater than threefold levels in the cancers compared to normal epithelium (t-test P <0.1 in dCHIP, and median false discovery rate <10 in SAM). Several pathways integral to tumorigenesis were up-regulated in the biliary cancers, including proliferation and cell cycle antigens (eg, cyclins D2 and E2, cdc2/p34, and geminin), transcription factors (eg, homeobox B7 and islet-1), growth factors and growth factor receptors (eg, hepatocyte growth factor, amphiregulin, and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor), and enzymes modulating sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents (eg, cystathionine beta synthase, dCMP deaminase, and CTP synthase). In addition, we identified several ""pathway"" genes that are rapidly emerging as novel therapeutic targets in cancer (eg, cytosolic phospholipase A2, an upstream target of the cyclooxygenase pathway, and ribosomal protein S6 kinase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, two important downstream mediators of the mitogenic Akt/mTOR signaling pathway). Overexpression of selected up-regulated genes was confirmed in tissue microarrays of biliary cancers by immunohistochemical analysis (n = 4) or in situ hybridization (n = 1), and in biliary cancer cell lines by reverse transcriptase PCR (n = 2). The majority of genes identified in the present study has not been previously reported in biliary cancers, and represent novel potential screening and therapeutic targets of this cancer type.",2003,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Donna E Hansel"", ids = ""5839007""); list(name = ""Ayman Rahman"", ids = ""39650819""); list(name = ""Manuel Hidalgo"", ids = ""143675901""); list(name = ""Paul J.

eaf71e913d18dc3f63167976196e3cf375d7f7d9,Commentary: Robust quantification of orientation selectivity and direction selectivity,"Mazurek et al. (2014) provided an important step forward in changing the old-fashioned manner of reporting orientation and/or direction selectivity of cells that involved the infamous OIâ€“orientation index, DI, and related quantities such as orientation bias and direction bias (OB/DB, see Leventhal et al., 2003; OB/DB are the normalized or./dir. vector lengths, defined as Lori and Ldir on p. 4 in Mazurek et al., 2014). At the beginning of their Results section, they demonstrated the unwanted features of these indexes, and showed that even non tuned cells can exhibit strong values of OI/DI. Therefore, they emphasized that little information was provided by these indexes (which I heartily welcome since it means I no longer have to discuss them with researchers and students) and investigated a statistical method of testing whether a cell is orientation- or direction-tuned. 
 
In this commentary, first I would put forward what should be the first basic report in physiological studies: tuning characteristics. Second, I extend Mazurek et al.'s analysis and compare their proposed test to the fitting approach, which they only advocated for extracting tuning parameters. I conclude by mentioning the issue of tuning decision based on p-value and related questions. 
 
First, OBs and associates cannot be the first analyses and reports since they are based on the tuning properties (see Figure 1 of Mazurek et al., 2014; and in my commentary, Figure â€‹Figure1A).1A). Even when a cell is clearly tuned, these indexes have the highly unwanted feature of depending on at least two of the tuning characteristics: background rate, tuning width, and amplitude(s) (mentioned by the authors, pp. 9â€“10). Consequently, one compares data sets using unknowingly biased values, without clear interpretation of what changed in the tuning properties (see Figure â€‹Figure1B).1B). As such, it is regrettable that the authors continue reporting results and statistical reliability with respect to OI/DI, when they should first have analyzed the tuning characteristics of the cells and how the decision criteria regarding the presence of tuning (e.g., their T2-test) depend on those parameters. Once the tuned cells are gathered and their parameters analyzed with respect to the hypotheses tested, then one may consider whether a composite index is appropriate for reporting the effects that are observed (e.g., SNR, OI, etc.).

Illustration of tuning, index variations, and statistical decision about tuning presence. (A) Examples of two theoretical orientation-tuned cells only differing in background firing rate (r0 of 10 and 30 Hz; Gaussian curves with amplitudes of 40 Hz and ... 
 
 
 
Second, the authors describe a method of testing whether a cell is tuned to orientation/motion direction (p.7). They propose creating sub-samples of single trial per orientation/direction from the measures, then computing the orientation/direction vector for each sub-sample and performing a Hotelling's T2-test to check whether the neuron's responses represent tuning against the hypothesis of uniform circular tuning. Later in their text (p. 11), they use fitting (Swindale, 1998), on those cells that were previously found to be tuned with the T2-test, to extract the tuning characteristics. Nevertheless, any model-based fitting approach allows one to test if a cell is tuned (H0, mean uniform response; and H1, the model describes the cell responses better than the mean) by using any relevant test statistics, for example an F-test between two nested models [F = (SS1 âˆ’ SS2)/(df1 âˆ’ df2)/(SS2/df2)]. Figure â€‹Figure1C1C plots the proportional results of detecting a direction tuning curve of a given amplitude using their proposed T2-test and the F-test, for two cells differing in background rate r0 (5 and 30 Hz; see legend and caption for details). While the sensitivities are strongly dependent on the tuning curve characteristics (but also on the experimental parameters, not shown), it is clear that their proposed Hotelling T2-test has a far worse sensitivity than the standard F-test (it is left to the reader to â€œtry-and-seeâ€ other experimental or tuning parameters). Therefore, it would be advisable that any researchers first test various â€œpresence of tuningâ€ tests before settling for one in their analysis (out of the two considered here, one can think of the randomization test, the chi-square test that includes the errors in each measurement, or R2, for example). Then, they should clearly provide the reason for their choice in the Methods section of their report (e.g., Persi et al., 2011), e.g., the best sensitivity among the methods or the smallest false discovery rate. 
 
As the authors nicely point out, it is important that the fitting procedure provides clearly interpretable parameters. I concur with the parameter constraint issues that they mention, and emphasize that researchers should consider in advance the sampling they will use in order to be able to make parameter estimates in the range of interest (e.g., if sampling steps were 22.5Â° it is difficult to believe that tuning widths at half-maximum of 45Â° or less would be easily measurable, that is, the curve depends on two or three data points for models with at least four parameters!). 
 
Finally, the importance of their paper lies in the clear presentation of the necessity in the physiological field of using a proper criteria when deciding whether a cell is tuned to the investigated variable (orientation, motion, speed, spatial frequency, etc.). Thus, it is natural that a statistical test should be used and that users must take care about the issue of repeated tests with the associated Î±-level adjustment (Figure â€‹(Figure1C,1C, and caption). Such a decision criteria is firmly desirable in any report, and it remains to be seen how the recent decade of increasing importance in closely related scientific fields concerning p-value, decision methods, and replication issues (e.g., Open Science Collaboration, 2015; Halsey et al., 2016; Lazzeroni et al., 2016) will influence the field of neurophysiology.",2016,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Tzvetomir Tzvetanov"", ids = ""2294565"")",a6edb10aafaf7b3a8a80559c0468ebc9edf69e02; c206f5af824347ffa9b3a4eba6c2789895beb6ad; a926e67e0802d6be702dcd4253aedd21220d0b46; 3778a9eaf2a168def358b6e08406de158641b160,2a84453518d7bfe8ec45d8995efbcef8fc2fa60d; 57d570f3a3fb2f2f581bb0d96eace2408c198033; 01103d68ecd36dd94e24d2fe593a09d64f0406cb; 2c11e839c3613263e77dc7f9712a06d537b2cfe1; 2c50a85cd6ac8579ff32ca4c7c57be246d8e1d76; edad39e274d0738903e67e695cca88ba56c66f9b; c0b7fa1c5fe6a76971d0ed50748198fa490c4174; b117beb56fecc6ea789902d0492c99048840c4ad,Frontiers in Neural Circuits,10,

Our objective was to conduct a gene ontology and pathway-based analysis to identify possible biological mechanisms involved in the regulation of bovine milk technological traits: coagulation properties, curd firmness modeling, individual cheese yield (CY), and milk nutrient recovery into the curd (REC) or whey loss traits. Results from 2 previous GWAS studies using 1,011 cows genotyped for 50k single nucleotide polymorphisms were used. Overall, the phenotypes analyzed consisted of 3 traditional milk coagulation property measures [RCT: rennet coagulation time defined as the time (min) from addition of enzyme to the beginning of coagulation; k20: the interval (min) from RCT to the time at which a curd firmness of 20 mm is attained; a30: a measure of the extent of curd firmness (mm) 30 min after coagulant addition], 6 curd firmness modeling traits [RCTeq: RCT estimated through the CF equation (min); CFP: potential asymptotic curd firmness (mm); kCF: curd-firming rate constant (% Ã— min-1); kSR: syneresis rate constant (% Ã— min-1); CFmax: maximum curd firmness (mm); and tmax: time to CFmax (min)], 3 individual CY-related traits expressing the weight of fresh curd (%CYCURD), curd solids (%CYSOLIDS), and curd moisture (%CYWATER) as a percentage of weight of milk processed and 4 milk nutrient and energy recoveries in the curd (RECFAT, RECPROTEIN, RECSOLIDS, and RECENERGY calculated as the % ratio between the nutrient in curd and the corresponding nutrient in processed milk), milk pH, and protein percentage. Each trait was analyzed separately. In total, 13,269 annotated genes were used in the analysis. The Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway databases were queried for enrichment analyses. Overall, 21 Gene Ontology and 17 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes categories were significantly associated (false discovery rate at 5%) with 7 traits (RCT, RCTeq, kCF, %CYSOLIDS, RECFAT, RECSOLIDS, and RECENERGY), with some being in common between traits. The significantly enriched categories included calcium signaling pathway, salivary secretion, metabolic pathways, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, the tight junction and the phosphatidylinositol pathways, as well as pathways related to the bovine mammary gland health status, and contained a total of 150 genes spanning all chromosomes but 9, 20, and 27.

342360e9fcca15ec3f99d4e1728a9482c01c28f3,A hybrid probabilistic framework for model validation with application to structural dynamics modeling,"Abstract Identifying useful mathematical models of physical systems is an essential part of computational modeling and simulation. Once appropriate models are identified, they can be used for applications such as response prediction, structural control, monitoring structural integrity, lifetime prognosis, etc. The number of models and model classes available to the modeler to represent a physical phenomenon, however, can be very large. Retaining all available models throughout a study can be computationally burdensome, so the modeler has the significant problem of identifying the valid models to be used in further studies. To address this challenge, a probabilistic framework is proposed herein for validating models by intertwining the concepts of model falsification and Bayesian model selection. Model falsification, based on the philosophy that measurements can only be used to falsify models, is used in this framework in both pre- and postprocessing steps to eliminate models and model classes, respectively, that cannot explain the measurements. This is the first study to propose a framework to integrate these two paradigms. A likelihood-bound model falsification, previously introduced by the authors, determines the validity of the initial candidate model classes, using the false discovery rate (FDR), and removes most of the incorrect ones without incurring any significant additional computational burden. Next, Bayesian model selection, which assigns posterior model class probabilities based on Bayesâ€™ theorem, is applied to the remaining model classes to identify the model(s) and model class(es) that provide predictions that probabilistically best fit the data. Finally, a postprocessing likelihood-bound falsification checks the validity of the final model class(es). The proposed framework is first illustrated through two nonlinear structural dynamics examples that show the efficacy of the proposed framework in identifying models for these structures as well as reducing the computational burden relative to Bayesian model selection applied alone. Finally, a third example uses measurement data from experiments performed on a full-scale four-story base-isolated building at the worldâ€™s largest shake table in Japanâ€™s â€œE-Defenseâ€ laboratory.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Subhayan De"", ids = ""51391007""); list(name = ""Patrick T.

To declare significance, we used a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.1. Results: Data from 61 patients were suitable for analysis: HCV-1 = 90%; male = 67%; median age = 52 yrs; ethnicity = 62% Caucasian, 20% African American,18% other; 70% were METAVIR F0-2, none cirrhotic. In the comparison of differential intrahepatic mRNA expression, 164 genes were significant. ISGs were heavily over-represented and showed lower expression levels in CC livers (OAS 1/2/3, MX1, IFIT 1/2/3 and ISG15 all had >3 fold lower expression). IL28B and IL28A gene expression were detectable at low levels; there was no difference by IL28B-type. The IFN signaling pathway was the most enriched canonical pathway differentially expressed by IL28B-type (P-value <10-5). In 25 patients PEG/RBV response data was available (17 were NR prior to biopsy; 5/8 treated post-biopsy attained SVR). IL28B-type was strongly associated with SVR (P-value = 0.004). SVR was associated with lower intrahepatic ISG expression levels. Conclusions: The CC IL28B-type was strongly associated with reduced expression of intrahepatic ISGs. In a subset, SVR was associated with both CC IL28B-type and reduced ISG expression. This suggests that genetic variation in IL28B regulates the innate immune response to HCV in the liver, priming patients for a stronger ISG response to exogenous IFN-Î± therapy.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ayse L Mindikoglu"", ids = ""10337618""); list(name = ""Laurence S.

28594801efa50e145e5df60064645f84b2d5770b,Optimizing the noise versus bias trade-off for Illumina whole genome expression BeadChips,"Five strategies for pre-processing intensities from Illumina expression BeadChips are assessed from the point of view of precision and bias. The strategies include a popular variance stabilizing transformation and model-based background corrections that either use or ignore the control probes. Four calibration data sets are used to evaluate precision, bias and false discovery rate (FDR). The original algorithms are shown to have operating characteristics that are not easily comparable. Some tend to minimize noise while others minimize bias. Each original algorithm is shown to have an innate intensity offset, by which unlogged intensities are bounded away from zero, and the size of this offset determines its position on the noise-bias spectrum. By adding extra offsets, a continuum of related algorithms with different noise-bias trade-offs is generated, allowing direct comparison of the performance of the strategies on equivalent terms. Adding a positive offset is shown to decrease the FDR of each original algorithm. The potential of each strategy to generate an algorithm with an optimal noise-bias trade-off is explored by finding the offset that minimizes its FDR. The use of control probes as part of the background correction and normalization strategy is shown to achieve the lowest FDR for a given bias.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Wei Shi"", ids = ""144854418""); list(name = ""Alicia Oshlack"", ids = ""2489165""); list(name = ""Gordon K.

338ee2304781759f469ab3e4300de461e5b1a992,Alcohol Use During Pregnancy is Associated with Specific Alterations in MicroRNA Levels in Maternal Serum,"BACKGROUND
Given the challenges of confirming prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) during pregnancy using currently established biomarkers of alcohol consumption, we examined whether serum microRNAs (miRNAs) may serve as stable biomarkers for PAE. Alterations in the levels of specific circulating miRNAs have been associated with various disease states and in animal models of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.


METHODS
Pregnant women in this prospective study were recruited from substance abuse and general maternity clinics affiliated with the University of New Mexico. Serum was collected at the time of admission for delivery from 14 subjects who reported â‰¥1 binge-drinking episode or â‰¥3 drinks/wk during pregnancy and 16 subjects who reported abstinence during pregnancy and tested negative for 5 ethanol biomarkers. Total RNA was isolated from serum and used for microarray analysis.


RESULTS
False discovery rate-corrected analyses of covariance revealed that 55 miRNAs were significantly altered between the 2 groups. Hierarchical clustering using only the significantly altered miRNAs grouped samples into alcohol-consuming and non-alcohol-consuming individuals. Discriminant analysis then identified miRs-122*, -126, -216b, -221*, -3119, -3942-5p, -4704-3p, -4743, -514-5p, and -602 as the top 10 discriminators between the 2 groups. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of putative miRNA targets illustrated that miRNAs identified in this study are involved in biological pathways that mediate the effects of alcohol, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, ERK1/2, and PI3K/AKT signaling.

40c9d2575f7fe39b329cd59fe16f58fc0f68290e,Transcriptomic Impacts of Rumen Epithelium Induced by Butyrate Infusion in Dairy Cattle in Dry Period,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of butyrate infusion on rumen epithelial transcriptome. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics are used to accelerate our understanding of regulation in rumen epithelial transcriptome of cattle in the dry period induced by butyrate infusion at the level of the whole transcriptome. Butyrate, as an essential element of nutrients, is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that can alter histone acetylation and methylation, and plays a prominent role in regulating genomic activities influencing rumen nutrition utilization and function. Ruminal infusion of butyrate was following 0-hour sampling (baseline controls) and continued for 168â€‰hours at a rate of 5.0â€‰L/day of a 2.5â€‰M solution as a continuous infusion. Following the 168-hour infusion, the infusion was stopped, and cows were maintained on the basal lactation ration for an additional 168â€‰hours for sampling. Rumen epithelial samples were serially collected via biopsy through rumen fistulae at 0-, 24-, 72-, and 168-hour (D1, D3, D7) and 168-hour post-infusion (D14). In comparison with pre-infusion at 0â€‰hours, a total of 3513 genes were identified to be impacted in the rumen epithelium by butyrate infusion at least once at different sampling time points at a stringent cutoff of false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.01. The maximal effect of butyrate was observed at day 7. Among these impacted genes, 117 genes were responsive consistently from day 1 to day 14, and another 42 genes were lasting through day 7. Temporal effects induced by butyrate infusion indicate that the transcriptomic alterations are very dynamic. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that in the early stage of rumen butyrate infusion (on day 1 and day 3 of butyrate infusion), the transcriptomic effects in the rumen epithelium were involved with mitotic cell cycle process, cell cycle process, and regulation of cell cycle. Bioinformatic analysis of cellular functions, canonical pathways, and upstream regulator of impacted genes underlie the potential mechanisms of butyrate-induced gene expression regulation in rumen epithelium. The introduction of transcriptomic and bioinformatic technologies to study nutrigenomics in the farm animal presented a new prospect to study multiple levels of biological information to better apprehend the whole animal response to nutrition, physiological state, and their interactions. The nutrigenomics approach may eventually lead to more precise management of utilization of feed resources in a more effective approach.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ransom L Baldwin"", ids = ""143915111""); list(name = ""Robert W.

793cbb04b520b001df5f84d2879cb3f9a6b38ec1,Validity of Micro-Data Loggers to Determine Walking Activity of Turkeys and Effects on Turkey Gait,"Accelerometers have the potential to provide objective, non-invasive methods for detecting changes in animal behavior and health. Our objectives were to: (1) determine the effects of micro-acceleration data loggers (accelerometers) and habituation to accelerometers on turkey gait and health status, (2) determine age-related changes in gait and health status, and (3) assess the validity and reliability of the accelerometers. Thirty-six male commercial turkeys were randomly assigned to one of five groups: accelerometer and habituation period (AH), accelerometer and no habituation period (AN), VetRap bandage (no accelerometer) and habituation period (VH), bandage (no accelerometer) and no habituation period (VN), and nothing on either leg (C). Health status and body condition were assessed prior to video-recording birds as they walked across a TekscanÂ® pressure pad at 8, 12, and 16 weeks to determine effects of treatment on number of steps, cadence, gait time, gait distance, gait velocity, impulse, gait cycle time, maximum force, peak vertical pressure, single support time, contact time, step length, step time, step velocity, stride length, total double support time, and duty factor. Accelerometer validity and reliability were determined by comparing the number of steps detected by the accelerometer to the number of steps determined from video recordings. Several age-related changes in turkey gait were found regardless of habituation including a slower cadence at 16 weeks, shorter gait distance at 8 weeks, and slower gait velocity at 16 weeks. When comparing bandaged vs. unbandaged limbs, both treatment and age-treatment interactions were found depending on the gait parameter. Accelerometer validity and reliability were affected by both age and treatment. False discovery rate increased, while accuracy and specificity decreased with age. Validity and reliability were lowest for non-habituated birds (AN and VN). Results demonstrated that micro-data loggers do not adversely affect turkey health status, but habituation to wearing accelerometers greatly affects accelerometer reliability and validity.

The aim of this study was to obtain a CNV genome map using the Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip data of 651 bulls of the Italian Brown Swiss breed. PennCNV and SVS7 (Golden Helix) software were used for the detection of the CNVs and Copy Number Variation Regions (CNVRs). A total of 5,099 and 1,289 CNVs were identified with PennCNV and SVS7 software, respectively. These were grouped at the population level into 1101 (220 losses, 774 gains, 107 complex) and 277 (185 losses, 56 gains and 36 complex) CNVR. Ten of the selected CNVR were experimentally validated with a qPCR experiment. The GO and pathway analyses were conducted and they identified genes (false discovery rate corrected) in the CNVR related to biological processes, cellular component, molecular function and metabolic pathways. Among those, we found the FCGR2B, PPARÎ±, KATNAL1, DNAJC15, PTK2, TG, STAT family, NPM1, GATA2, LMF1, ECHS1 genes, already known in literature because of their association with various traits in cattle. Although there is variability in the CNVRs detection across methods and platforms, this study allowed the identification of CNVRs in Italian Brown Swiss, overlapping those already detected in other breeds and finding additional ones, thus producing new knowledge for association studies with traits of interest in cattle.",2015,,"list(name = ""Alessandro Bagnato"", ids = ""1878307""); list(name = ""Maria Giuseppina Strillacci"", ids = ""3857502""); list(name = ""Laura Pellegrino"", ids = ""145570962""); list(name = ""Fausta Schiavini"", ids = ""4732716""); list(name = ""Erika Frigo"", ids = ""3033535""); list(name = ""Attilio Rossoni"", ids = ""6195374""); list(name = ""Luca Fontanesi"", ids = ""2568019""); list(name = ""Christian Maltecca"", ids = ""6089360""); list(name = ""Raphaelle Teresa Matilde Maria Prinsen"", ids = ""15242751""); list(name = ""Marlies A.

4588f1ef993c255e709a2a76b28b966a242c2031,SNP Analysis of Caries and Initial Caries in Finnish Adolescents,"Background
Dental caries is the most common infection in the world and is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors are largely known, but the role of genetic factors is quite unknown. The aim was to investigate the genetic background of caries in Finnish adolescents.


Materials and Methods
This study was carried out at the Kotka Health Center in Eastern Finland. 94 participants aged 15-17 years gave approval for the saliva and DNA analyses. However, one was excluded in DNA analysis; thus, the overall number of participants in analysis was 93. Caries status was recorded clinically and from bite-wing X-rays to all 94 participants. Genomic DNA was extracted by genomic QIAampÂ® DNA Blood Mini Kit and genotyped for polymorphisms. The results were analyzed using additive and logistic regression models.


Results
No significant associations between caries and the genes studied were found. However, SNPs in DDX39B and MPO showed association tendencies but were not statistically significant after false discovery rate (FDR) analysis. SNPs in VDR, LTA, and MMP3 were not statistically significant with initial caries lesions after FDR analysis.


Conclusion
The present study could not demonstrate statistically significant associations between caries and the genes studied. Further studies with larger populations are needed.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Teija Raivisto"", ids = ""14695516""); list(name = ""A.

93caa134d910d51de6e7f28c2929a6749d358b8f,Resting-state functional connectivity of the nucleus accumbens in auditory and visual hallucinations in schizophrenia.,"Both auditory hallucinations (AH) and visual hallucinations may occur in schizophrenia. One of the main hypotheses underlying their occurrence involves the increased activity of the mesolimbic pathway, which links the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). However, the precise contribution of the mesolimbic pathway in hallucinations across various sensory modalities has not yet been explored. We compared the resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) of the NAcc among 16 schizophrenia patients with pure AH, 15 with both visuoauditory hallucinations (VAH), and 14 without hallucinations (NoH). A between-group comparison was performed using random-effects ANCOVA (rs-FC of the bilateral NAcc as the dependent variable, groups as the between-subjects factor, age and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores as covariates; q(false discovery rate [FDR]) < .05). Compared to the NoH group, the AH group exhibited significantly enhanced NAcc rs-FC with the left temporal superior gyrus, the cingulate gyri, and the VTA, whereas the VAH group, compared to the AH group, exhibited significantly enhanced NAcc rs-FC with the bilateral insula, putamen, parahippocampal gyri, and VTA. The strength in rs-FC between the NAcc and the VTA appeared to be positively associated with the presence of hallucinations, but the NAcc FC patterns changed with the complexity of these experiences (ie, 0, 1, or 2 sensory modalities), rather than with severity. This might support the aberrant salience hypothesis of schizophrenia. Moreover, these findings suggest that future clinical and neurobiological studies of hallucinations should evaluate not only the global severity of symptoms but also their sensorial features.",2015,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Benjamin Rolland"", ids = ""2897361""); list(name = ""Ali Amad"", ids = ""6294523""); list(name = ""Emmanuel Poulet"", ids = ""3764782""); list(name = ""RÃ©gis Bordet"", ids = ""145758266""); list(name = ""Alexandre Vignaud"", ids = ""40182081""); list(name = ""ReÌ\201my Bation"", ids = ""3780259""); list(name = ""Christine Delmaire"", ids = ""2110676""); list(name = ""Pierre Thomas"", ids = ""28164722""); list(name = ""Olivier Cottencin"", ids = ""4321694""); list(name = ""Renaud Jardri"", ids = ""2576835"")",1e1d270921dc5b84e307f073cae845831e3dd3b8; 49101c15616732cbb54123c3cbf61983a4c48a6e; b539596bb4a2bb3703719b5c3aaf6ffefe0370e2; e2e81a3ca4538ec3934ad58119cc4fc3eff23871; f458989a1a9c713506128e98c018671567753b2f; 219e16bec5a4f40c0464cce6dd2ced7864c7a056; 0feb1e18e4014831650144bbdfa1bdfcf2d8932d; 0f6c620a805923d7880a25f51c698b5af51eefd2; cd84d149650d4d771167e46a38f276b9ca11df15; 6d3b37a26a664eda22563f0422211222b8f72459; 480454c7d81b8567f195adb46ac5cda8160dce8b; d78fc3421dba057d88e6c839d7102b2dc050945e; 0d8e7c07b849d78f186c14d094bfa52a8293b2d2; 80245fab68a7dc3e1cc9631f132ca8797baad9e5; c5c9c626955b86a02b919092dc0a76b40699e566; 023c4a48c4783c0aeab42e8027fff605c888fe89; 4e9c533bbd9e91a545e76cdd798a78c0d6bacb8d; b82ea6f293ddfa89a1968e27bbd2660c0b17e23a; 92c4f18ee938cf9f74ce4aa045ae8bc63ce53de3; 57a7337ee807dd19cb557f9955434bc93a54ddb7; b4dd055de52b938c23cb57a67bb0bd2a73c31cd0; 74e6a8a8b502634d02052259a6aec749144bb0a9; dc8d6553b3f927ef4b7d40aea0853eb87dff2433; 5d50980cb273055b004a87b5821c780f4f11cf59; 0b6e2f2f636306650c4c49ae23cfc307c94ee386; 5032afad266022a4a33dcbeff4ae3157463c3f2b; 2fac2c2ac3709cd55db10277741ebb0910f52dc6; 483f0d7da127c4b6fc6240c39a3aff6499eb4038; c5b9de53258ec1f20e165c2b4f2e370427ca4436; 69bf84a056248f2e09d7245cb8a2b1a46b2c6b29; 5b33dda19fb6bb5f1973be92af3e9b73635fcffa; 21be5ce2c722b55497f60015185139166416ff5d; cf145cd0631af345df065c6fb92840d06cfe50cd; bd2b863fff24854e2629d0fc7290da20cff03e32; bb54b47fd817c1096be49caa5626d8c21ff33512; f14dd788256682a370eb14fb6101f53a61e2f958; 059b5ae0e82856c8d592e61d538042222d8f52b1,,Schizophrenia bulletin,41 1,"

The results of irGEP for CUP were compared with published data for ICI-treated solid cancers classified into progressive disease (PD) and non-PD subsets according to their best response to ICIs.ResultsThe median overall survival of all CUP patients was 29.3â€‰months (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.7â€“not reached) and 7.1â€‰months (95% CI, 5.0â€“9.4) for favorable and unfavorable subsets, respectively. IHC and irGEP revealed that pretreatment immune activityâ€”including expression of immune checkpoint moleculesâ€”for CUP was similar to that for ICI-responsive malignancies (antitumor immune cell signatures: CUP versus PD, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002â€“0.067; CUP versus non-PD, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.591â€“0.999), although VEGFA expression was associated with suppression of antitumor immunity in CUP (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.008, false discovery rateâ€‰=â€‰0.010). In addition, one case of CUP in the unfavorable subset that was associated with prominent PD-L1 expression on TILs and showed a durable response to nivolumab is presented.ConclusionsThe survival outcome of CUP remains unsatisfactory. However, our clinical and immune profiling of CUP has revealed a potential to benefit from immunotherapy, with ICIs thus being a potential option for CUP treatment.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Koji Haratani"", ids = ""6408807""); list(name = ""Hidetoshi Hayashi"", ids = ""145412376""); list(name = ""Takayuki Takahama"", ids = ""38784011""); list(name = ""Yasushi Nakamura"", ids = ""152839009""); list(name = ""Shuta Tomida"", ids = ""51305023""); list(name = ""Takeshi Yoshida"", ids = ""144441834""); list(name = ""Yasutaka Chiba"", ids = ""32832693""); list(name = ""Takahiro Sawada"", ids = ""153435844""); list(name = ""Kazuko Sakai"", ids = ""34691442""); list(name = ""Yoshihiko Fujita"", ids = ""153840103""); list(name = ""Yosuke Togashi"", ids = ""5828680""); list(name = ""Junko Tanizaki"", ids = ""152788265""); list(name = ""Hisato Kawakami"", ids = ""6143359""); list(name = ""Akihiko Ito"", ids = ""153027420""); list(name = ""Kazuto Nishio"", ids = ""3667117""); list(name = ""Kazuhiko Nakagawa"", ids = ""145705568"")",,1536f7786aa522e41e28549b12fa0837eab0b919; 12c1a2707c2ec12a8d9f46ca02007fab24f1ca3b; a5f816633a44ac7390cb7cc7abea23746790e47c; 05d6eec2f0cb8fcd62dba7692f67bbbb2a298b50; 20168d98562f47dc9e41623008f83e1c8bdee0c0; 8a1fad1e375df5dc187c47a638696c646ee2f5a8; 43a2700c9ddd57a04e42e71fd8ce36e1c5c6367a; 6558758cd05ed187528c64d8684699c933fe0458; a6835b6046b0758e02899547eb65d10b07243a68; 98deb8e4a2477bd58a9887f06c63d1662b96de4d; ce492abf3837e7b4abd5e7610d7ee508cb8d0cf8; 1272e3c6b03bcb951d1fd0f00e8518863e53f175; 6b63e3c8913fb642dd75c86adcaf174b5b7c7daf; b2b096e29f835a05db4db0786a1df22aafe1e116; 5dd77f44ab66bf790ff40893f880eed95c72f90d; a28f074c4b914f9bdc63c5db0a4ddf6c9b8d1c24; 34b9635d7779e219e9d60e0d3d33919ca9bc123c; 2c96ca62d538ff43fce01bc848fc018f6ae2b4a0; a1d77f76e7c269a69c706105f7ce5f1a71c42d59; fb585578db0125ac3cea86de84525ae379bbbc60; b6b3a0a029c5f739848a535e4259accbab7c3587; 3c3165b07b1fb2e09a802e7f94ea6b83c4cf14fd; 601d4ea93a64f5267d056142c22e1ce06ad86e63; 258d74a7aa6b74736d1a1c26af6af650a00111b2; 6a8a53c7f9fd79ff959c6101698e58d58ff6123e; dfebd9f340093daec4b8688e65ae58f669bea2b9; 82e0b726e2d1641473d7c9d8982eb56c33397efe; 33144475f9fa050ec3e5c1fe259ffea415ad83c3; 7f15793fc4f2dcc038788ec64b5cefbfbbbb2f2d; 19bb12241e2c3f8885900ef5562f2bf62344ee78; c3eece2204a50bd19dd27a83d182613552d01166; 92e8690c42f2621b132290f616681a793f135535; 9c98ec2603e148b511339308117e1b22b1376861,Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer,7,
f4ebbfb1bcc8224a69e7f7141bae8605b1cce000,A comprehensive time-courseâ€“based multicohort analysis of sepsis and sterile inflammation reveals a robust diagnostic gene set,"Although several dozen studies of gene expression in sepsis have been published, distinguishing sepsis from a sterile systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is still largely up to clinical suspicion. We hypothesized that a multicohort analysis of the publicly available sepsis gene expression data sets would yield a robust set of genes for distinguishing patients with sepsis from patients with sterile inflammation. A comprehensive search for gene expression data sets in sepsis identified 27 data sets matching our inclusion criteria. Five data sets (n = 663 samples) compared patients with sterile inflammation (SIRS/trauma) to time-matched patients with infections. We applied our multicohort analysis framework that uses both effect sizes and P values in a leave-one-data set-out fashion to these data sets. We identified 11 genes that were differentially expressed (false discovery rate â‰¤1%, interâ€“data set heterogeneity P > 0.01, summary effect size >1.5-fold) across all discovery cohorts with excellent diagnostic power [mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.87; range, 0.7 to 0.98]. We then validated these 11 genes in 15 independent cohorts comparing (i) time-matched infected versus noninfected trauma patients (4 cohorts), (ii) ICU/trauma patients with infections over the clinical time course (3 cohorts), and (iii) healthy subjects versus sepsis patients (8 cohorts). In the discovery Glue Grant cohort, SIRS plus the 11-gene set improved prediction of infection (compared to SIRS alone) with a continuous net reclassification index of 0.90. Overall, multicohort analysis of time-matched cohorts yielded 11 genes that robustly distinguish sterile inflammation from infectious inflammation.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Timothy E.

9e98e30e677b12de38376ffd456a517bf8a87254,Title Predictors of the Extent of Carotid Atherosclerosis in PatientsTreated with Radiotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,"Objective: To determine the predictors of the extent of carotid atherosclerosis in patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: The present study investigated 129 post-RT NPC patients. Carotid atherosclerotic parameters, such as carotid intima-media thickness, carotid arterial stiffness and carotid plaque burden (plaque score, the presence of plaque and $50% stenosis) were assessed using ultrasonography. The association between carotid atherosclerotic parameters and nine potential predictors, including age, gender, post-RT duration, radiation dose, chemotherapy, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking, were determined using multiple regression. The cutoff values of age, post-RT duration and number of cardiovascular risk factors for the presence of carotid plaque or $50% carotid stenosis were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Multiple testing was corrected using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate. Results: Age, post-RT duration and number of cardiovascular risk factors were significantly associated with carotid plaque burden (corrected P value, Pcor,0.05). Age of 44.5 years (sensitivity599.2% and specificity550%, Pcor,0.01) and postRT duration of 8.5 years (sensitivity575.7% and specificity564.3%, Pcor,0.001) were the cutoff values for detecting carotid plaque, while post-RT duration of 13.5 years (sensitivity566.7% and specificity571.6%, Pcor,0.001) and 1.5 cardiovascular risk factors (sensitivity540.7% and specificity584.3%, Pcor,0.05) were the cutoff values for screening $50% carotid stenosis.

b6b081fd9c06f233c44e93185363ff3ee2aede68,Impact of Protease on Ultraviolet Photodissociation Mass Spectrometry for Bottom-up Proteomics.,"Recent mass spectrometric studies have reported enhanced proteome coverage by employing multiple proteases or by using multiple or alternative activation methods such as electron-transfer dissociation in combination with collisional-activated dissociation (CAD). In this study the use of 193 nm ultraviolet photodissociation for the analysis of thousands of Halobacterium salinarum peptides generated by four proteases (trypsin, LysC, GluC, and chymotrypsin) was evaluated in comparison with higher energy CAD (HCD). Proteins digested by trypsin resulted in greater sequence coverage for HCD over UVPD. LysC digestion resulted in similar sequence coverages for UVPD and HCD; however, for proteins digested by GluC and chymotrypsin 5-10% more sequence coverage on average was achieved by UVPD. HCD resulted in more peptide identifications (at 1% false discovery rate) for trypsin (4356 peptides by HCD versus 3907 peptides by UVPD), whereas UVPD identified greater numbers of peptides for LysC digests (1033 peptides by UVPD versus 844 HCD), chymotrypsin digests (3219 peptides for UVPD versus 2921 for HCD), and GluC digests (2834 peptides for UVPD and 2393 for HCD) and correspondingly greater numbers of proteins.",2015,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sylvester M.

cba924b73076cfac99022b69c21d4f8ae0c7f3c2,Genome-wide association scan for stature in Chinese: evidence for ethnic specific loci,"In Caucasian, several studies have identified some common variants associated with human stature variation. However, no such study was performed in Chinese, which is the largest population in the world and evidently differs from Caucasian in genetic background. To identify common or ethnic specific genes for stature in Chinese, an initial GWAS and follow-up replication study were performed. Our initial GWAS study found that a group of 13 contiguous SNPs, which span a region of ~150Â kb containing two neighboring genes, zinc finger protein (ZNP) 510 and ZNP782, achieved strong signals for association with stature, with P values ranging from 9.71Â Ã—Â 10âˆ’5 to 3.11Â Ã—Â 10âˆ’6. After false discovery rate correction for multiple testing, 9 of the 13 SNPs remain significant (FDR qÂ =Â 0.036âˆ’0.046). The follow-up replication study in an independent 2,953 unrelated southern Chinese confirmed the association of rs10816533 with stature (PÂ =Â 0.029). All the13 SNPs were in consistently strong linkage disequilibrium (Dâ€²Â >Â 0.99) and formed a single perfect haplotype block. The minor allele frequencies for the 13 contiguous SNPs have evidently ethnic difference, which range from 0.21 to 0.33 in Chinese but have as low as ~0.017 reported in dbSNP database in Caucasian. The present results suggest that the genomic region containing the ZNP510 and ZNP782 genes is an ethnic specific locus associated with stature variation in Chinese.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Shufeng Lei"", ids = ""2276400""); list(name = ""Tie-Lin Yang"", ids = ""80245379""); list(name = ""Li-jun Tan"", ids = ""2668355""); list(name = ""Xiang-ding Chen"", ids = ""2259300""); list(name = ""Yan Guo"", ids = ""46791107""); list(name = ""Yan-Fang Guo"", ids = ""1991040""); list(name = ""Liang Zhang"", ids = ""1745594""); list(name = ""Xiao-gang Liu"", ids = ""38066027""); list(name = ""Han Yan"", ids = ""145282212""); list(name = ""Feng Pan"", ids = ""144997184""); list(name = ""Zhi-xin Zhang"", ids = ""2519575""); list(name = ""Yu-Mei Peng"", ids = ""16291380""); list(name = ""Qi Zhou"", ids = ""38147088""); list(name = ""Li-na He"", ids = ""49160140""); list(name = ""Xue-zhen Zhu"", ids = ""8362120""); list(name = ""Jing Cheng"", ids = ""144569558""); list(name = ""Yao-zhong Liu"", ids = ""7137552""); list(name = ""Christopher J.

Rapid response to chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients (response within 12 weeks of chemotherapy) may increase the chance of complete resection and improved survival. Few molecular markers predict irinotecan-induced rapid response and survival. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in solute carrier genes are reported to correlate with the variable pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and folate in cancer patients. This study aims to evaluate the predictive role of 3 SNPs in mCRC patients treated with irinotecan and fluoropyrimidine-containing regimens.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Three SNPs were selected and genotyped in 137 mCRC patients from a Chinese prospective multicenter trial (NCT01282658). The chi-squared test, univariate and multivariable logistic regression model, and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to evaluate correlations between the genotypes and rapid response. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the associations between genotypes and survival outcomes. Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate correction was used in multiple testing.


RESULTS
Genotype GA/AA of SNP rs2306283 of the gene SLCO1B1 and genotype GG of SNP rs1051266 of the gene SLC19A1 were associated with a higher rapid response rate (odds ratio [OR] =3.583 and 3.521, 95%CI =1.301-9.871 and 1.271-9.804, p=0.011 and p=0.013, respectively). The response rate was 70% in patients with both genotypes, compared with only 19.7% in the remaining patients (OR = 9.489, 95%CI = 2.191-41.093, Fisher's exact test p=0.002). Their significances were all maintained even after multiple testing (all p c < 0.05). The rs2306283 GA/AA genotype was also an independent prognostic factor of longer progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio = 0.402, 95%CI = 0.171-0.945, p=0.037).

5b810d9f0f933aff2b79819640af73c6d116ba44,Locating Multiple Interacting Quantitative Trait Loci with the Zero-Inflated Generalized Poisson Regression,"We consider the problem of locating multiple interacting quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing traits measured in counts. In many applications the distribution of the count variable has a spike at zero. Zero-inflated generalized Poisson regression (ZIGPR) allows for an additional probability mass at zero and hence an improvement in the detection of significant loci. Classical model selection criteria often overestimate the QTL number. Therefore, modified versions of the Bayesian Information Criterion (mBIC and EBIC) were successfully used for QTL mapping. We apply these criteria based on ZIGPR as well as simpler models. An extensive simulation study shows their good power detecting QTL while controlling the false discovery rate. We illustrate how the inability of the Poisson distribution to account for over-dispersion leads to an overestimation of the QTL number and hence strongly discourages its application for identifying factors influencing count data. The proposed method is used to analyze the mice gallstone data of Lyons et al. (2003). Our results suggest the existence of a novel QTL on chromosome 4 interacting with another QTL previously identified on chromosome 5. We provide the corresponding code in R.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Erhardt Vinzenz"", ids = ""103915360""); list(name = ""Bogdan Malgorzata"", ids = ""102792561""); list(name = ""Czado Claudia"", ids = ""103619789"")",15aafdec96264f25f490fefa2fc8ef525b162f44,,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology,9,1-27
883136565c69e9b7e389f8faac73879e61a93850,A molecular basis for embryo apposition at the luminal epithelium,"To obtain a gene expression profile during embryo apposition to the luminal epithelium, we isolated mouse luminal epithelium from implantation (IM) and interimplantation (INTER) sites using laser capture microdissection (LCM), and analyzed their gene expression by microarray analysis. IM and INTER sites were sampled on day 4.5 after mating of female mice with fertile males (day 0.5 = vaginal plug). RNA was extracted, amplified, labeled, and hybridized to microarrays and results were analyzed using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) method. Comparison of IM and INTER sites by SAM identified 73 genes most highly ranked at IM, while 13 genes most highly expressed at the INTER sites, within the estimated false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.163. Among 73 genes at IM, 20 were ESTs or were of unknown function, and the remain 53 genes had known functions mainly relating to cellular structuring and others such as cell cycling, gene/protein expression, immune responses, invasion, metabolism, oxidative stress, or signal transduction. Specifically, of the 24 structural genes, 14 were implicated in extracellular matrix and tissue remodeling. Meanwhile, of the 13 genes that were highly expressed at INTER, eight were ESTs or of unknown function, and the remaining five were implicated in metabolism, signal transduction, and gene/protein expression. Among these 58 (53 + 5) genes with known functions, 13 genes (22.4%) were associated with Ca2+ for their function. Results of the present study suggest that (1) at IM sites, active tissue remodeling is occurring for embryo invasion while the INTER sites are relatively quiescent and (2) Ca2+ may be a vital regulatory factor in the apposition process. Investigations of human homologues of those genes expressed in the mouse luminal epithelium during apposition may help to understand the implantation process and/or implantation failure in humans.",2004,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Se-jin Yoon"", ids = ""47948153""); list(name = ""Dong-Hee Choi"", ids = ""90734624""); list(name = ""Woo-Sik Lee"", ids = ""2762244""); list(name = ""Kwang-Yul Cha"", ids = ""117150649""); list(name = ""Kyung-Ah Lee"", ids = ""8035737"")",e98ee7a2a3b9c0435c6f4523f71c9c4cf7053b05; 9f42aec1e4a092d88e796971efce1efa159e7555; cfbc0dae22ceb7aa0fa90f952af98c8a2a2a2c4f; c3d85ce74469f88f3dc1f51faa04bf624cf41f4d; 2e0cda87ee436a80373953d9d515f2edd1423d90; 9eff0ee3e65cbc939c81c293670d640f4a2be81d; f544e25fe0e6a86fdadab587189a53b73598e5cd; bb9e58b6db800ed4fa7f660b047c497bc09d06a1; f1d9199c0d82206679b1f25eeaefb061f8f0c54c; 5e105fe9eb8f8a7383f7bc7377b50190f005539f; 49a5ee0b98e70f79daf0d53048d3c9ebc8d0bddf; a5168ea571716cbe9eeb2dca10f172c8f279c223; 7d4decd534480ad76759013ab442b8dca02f6100; b81f9f1cdde5d11aceab2a76b974b00a54bd9baa; 54f42e9e0f31fb724e72e958e3b205ee69376b32,,Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology,219,95-104

Here we identified 2,957 novel age-associated DNA methylation sites (P < 0.01 and R(2)â€‰> 0.5) in blood of eight pairs of Chinese Han female monozygotic twins. Among them, nine novel sites (false discovery rate < 0.01), along with three other reported sites, were further validated in 49 unrelated female volunteers with ages of 20-80 years by Sequenom Massarray. A total of 95 CpGs were covered in the PCR products and 11 of them were built the age prediction models. After comparing four different models including, multivariate linear regression, multivariate nonlinear regression, back propagation neural network and support vector regression, SVR was identified as the most robust model with the least mean absolute deviation from real chronological age (2.8 years) and an average accuracy of 4.7 years predicted by only six loci from the 11 loci, as well as an less cross-validated error compared with linear regression model.

79005710f8c9da1f19c33374790f844399fbe2d5,Reduced White Matter Integrity With Cognitive Impairments in End Stage Renal Disease,"Background: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a serious public health problem, which can often lead to multiorgan dysfunction, such as cerebrovascular disease and cognitive damage. It is essential to understand cognitive impairment in patients with ESRD to develop better ESRD treatment and prevent further cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment is believed to be related to structural abnormalities in the brain. Purpose: To investigate white matter microstructural abnormalities in patients with ESRD using TBSS analysis of DTI and to explore the possible mechanisms underlying the impaired cognitive function. Materials and Methods: A TBSS analysis of DTI data was to investigate the microstructural changes in their WM over the whole brain. We chose the white matter tracts or regions with significantly reduced FA as the regions of interest (ROIs), Pearson's correlations were performed between clinical indicators (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), digit span task scores, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and hemodialysis duration) and the mean FA value of the ROIs in the ESRD patients. Results: Lower FA and higher MD, AD and RD values were observed in widespread and symmetrical WM in ESRD patients than healthy controls (HCs), Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significantly positive correlation between the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and FA values in the right corona radiata and left anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) and demonstrated a significantly negative correlation between FA values and the serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen in the ATR (P < 0.01) in addition, digit span task scores positively correlate with the FA value in the left anterior rather than in the corona radiata. No cluster survived when we adopted the False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction to multiple comparisons. Conclusion: Our study indicate widespread impairment of the white matter in ESRD patients. Damage to the thalamic radiation and corona radiata may affect cognitive function in ESRD patients, the reduced integrity of ATR may tend to affect the working memory while the damage to the corona radiata may involve the executive function impaired in ESRD patients. The accumulation of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen may contribute to the WM impairment.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yi Yin"", ids = ""143816051""); list(name = ""Meng Li"", ids = ""50651874""); list(name = ""Chao Li"", ids = ""1679961""); list(name = ""Xiaofen Ma"", ids = ""7832377""); list(name = ""Jianhao Yan"", ids = ""5230521""); list(name = ""Tianyue Wang"", ids = ""3352577""); list(name = ""Shishun Fu"", ids = ""32261583""); list(name = ""Kelei Hua"", ids = ""34758575""); list(name = ""Yunfan Wu"", ids = ""6573612""); list(name = ""Wenfeng Zhan"", ids = ""49260217""); list(name = ""Guihua Jiang"", ids = ""145917573"")",,dc818a8c73afd5ed907da76180de5975e40f430d; 08e8575cf267478bd11b159c2d0f14b7d9a71e0a; 502fbabee50d8df5c7d2894a691ea195d6ead6be; 44d43582af88f72c2effb0008d93d2456b0d8b99; 385881b5497472c6d3426a472f522daec3853d6c; 6ae5d8217cafc2f89b83637af4e7e3816cffd1d8; e7678bb78fa645133d131500a864759a6ec2200e; a8915fff4b945d1adb3fb5cc168ca55f0fad52c0; 602eabd7c04f1b4e44e75149247ee5c4d43600ba; ec34c8ba64021ab2227a92a5b371d6d897fd5f28; 1ea29a2bc152c2955909e65bea90fbb4537fccc5; a639ab1f92024bc4a5745419de1aa1b9554b3a03; 0570ff70c04664c88a57598ec811264570912e2e; 371d2a1cfa53cf2c07f4828fd32ab95b11d6c5db; 9a8c0bee12c58884ddacc561d51d6ef55b5d977c; c85062093074b7b225d593ed3ee28bef8f2407d8; 724f6ca1872691c53ed1af749ba4b9d7fa542f4f; 1ebf057f6cd9dd4aa725e1e165ce0c4a30de9e1a; 62d5ccf94b278749429fa46c23e61546697d56c3; c932e75bef1e84a2f848ea0d467791cf5bb15a29; 7be54406543cd9d184b92e2ea34d44e1513f3e97; 4f9fba03331d3d58036a26e95f3bfde52be38330; 32b6f084a41d3288543a15f4e6bcead5a59001b7; 609f912bda4789ff2b3db7e615b750098f5eda8f; fd2a00c02de6f0b6a8f935fd0599f19903526a38; 79a7803d521f358512569677613377e1367b7661; ebbd2cfd1f98d77d7a16db4509c5aaee5ec6f63c; f4c7163ea523c8fbb97fcb3700af18ca05bb1ff2; 053355a2bd73bc64aa577a73012e594ceab12513; 2e4164687705b37d1a8512112f6f139f2d9d9a59; d7ad39aad6299efb584a11e41b2cdb33a40a3354; fc54d1ada69607d67868edff7e485bb0e31fcbdc; 3f2e370e19b6329110d0570090a56a4c050486ae; c7f41856fb754687b6156284d0ed6c78f7e6cf66; 2eaa2cb1f88c1632ade4372fc97fbb926ebd0dd3,Frontiers in Psychiatry,9,

4d43889707fecdffd2a6a111c200adefb5b7eb26,Differential Proteomics Identifies Protein Biomarkers That Predict Local Relapse of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas.,"PURPOSE: The 5-year survival rates of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) remain disappointing. HNSCCs develop in precursor fields of genetically altered cells that are often not completely resected when the tumor is excised, causing local relapse. These precursor fields are mostly recognized as dysplasia, but histologic grading cannot reliably predict malignant transformation. Our aim was to discover and validate protein biomarkers that can detect precursor fields and predict local relapse in HNSCC using immunostaining of surgical margins. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We compared paired and genetically characterized normal, precursor, and tumor tissues of eight patients by proteome analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins. The prognostic value of candidate protein biomarkers was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of 222 surgical margins of 46 HNSCC patients who developed local relapse or remained disease free. Significant associations were determined by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox-proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Forty proteins showed significant differential expression (false discovery rate-corrected P < 0.05). Most discriminative markers suited for immunostaining were keratin 4 and cornulin. Low expression in the surgical margins of keratin 4 (hazard ratio, 3.8; P = 0.002), cornulin (hazard ratio, 2.7; P = 0.025), and their combination (hazard ratio, 8.8; P = 0.0005) showed a highly significant association with the development of local relapse. Dysplasia grading had no prognostic relevance. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical assessment of keratin 4 and cornulin expression in surgical margins of HNSCC patients outperforms histopathologic grading in predicting the risk for local relapse. These markers can be used to initiate more frequent and lifelong surveillance of patients at high risk of local relapse, and enable selection for adjuvant treatment or tertiary prevention trials.

83667fb3e2a1472dd073c9cb93c0604dc17b20f6,Prevalence and Correlates of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder Among Adolescents with Bipolar Disorder.,"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and correlates of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder phenotype (DMDDP) in a clinical population of adolescents with bipolar disorder (BD).


METHODS
DMDD criteria were modified and applied to a sample of 116 adolescents with BD-I (nâ€‰=â€‰30), BD-II (nâ€‰=â€‰46) or BD-not otherwise specified (NOS) (nâ€‰=â€‰40) from a tertiary teaching hospital. Diagnoses were determined via the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Aged Children, Present and Lifetime version (KSADS-PL). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) DMDD Criteria A-G were derived from the KSADS oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) screening interview and supplement, as well as narrative summaries. Chi-square analyses or t tests (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) were conducted as appropriate, followed by logistic regression. P values were adjusted using the false discovery rate (FDR) approach.


RESULTS
DMDDP criteria could not be determined for 8 adolescents because of missing data from the ODD supplement. Twenty-five percent of the remainder (27/108) met criteria for DMDDP. DMDDP was not associated with BD subtype or with family history of BD. In univariate analyses, after controlling for age, sex, and race, DMDDP was associated with lower functioning, increased family conflict, assault history, and attention deficit and/or hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (FDR adjusted p values: <0.0001, < 0.0001, 0.007, and 0.007, respectively). Lifetime substance use disorder and medication use approached significance (adjusted pâ€‰=â€‰0.05). In logistic regression, DMDDP was independently associated with greater parent-reported family conflict (odds ratio [OR] 1.17; confidence interval [CI- 1.06-1.30; pâ€‰=â€‰0.001) and greater functional impairment (OR 0.89; CI 0.82-0.97; pâ€‰=â€‰0.006). DMDDP was also associated with a threefold increase in ADHD, although ADHD was only marginally significant (OR 3.3; CI 0.98-10.94; pâ€‰=â€‰0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Despite the positioning of DMDD as phenotypically and biologically distinct from BD, these phenotypes commonly overlap in clinical settings. This overlap is not explained by BD-NOS or by nonfamilial BD. The association of ADHD with DMDDP in this sample draws into question whether arousal symptoms should have been retained as originally elaborated in the severe mood dysregulation phenotype. Strategies to mitigate the excessive functional impairment of this comorbidity are warranted.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rachel Hb Mitchell"", ids = ""35094302""); list(name = ""Vanessa Timmins"", ids = ""7349931""); list(name = ""Jordan E Collins"", ids = ""8159820""); list(name = ""Antonette Scavone"", ids = ""6953825""); list(name = ""Adam Iskric"", ids = ""7867531""); list(name = ""Benjamin I Goldstein"", ids = ""2316612"")",db0324ae71196e5e0ee8331bea3ac733364ad1f4; cb936ec0b4c84d9c89a8302e2581196037d081b7; 478117efd15181fce313eeda37c0f958807711d7; c2215735fba403cc647664d80537ce2df3358544; 7f96f21fd4c6c1688012bc40be16fd25851f0e6d; 4d88b6e06d52d6c7ff2a9bf707dda0b293b607fa; 45afcd3dcfe9ebd8d76f849f953dc74275157490; 87347499e19f5ce29d34a2457faee760ccabb9b7,,Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,26 2,"

2048aa8f10d832d4ed1608f9188cf47d2ec5e71a,"A whole genome scan for quantitative trait loci affecting milk protein percentage in Israeli-Holstein cattle, by means of selective milk DNA pooling in a daughter design, using an adjusted false discovery rate criterion.","Selective DNA pooling was employed in a daughter design to screen all bovine autosomes for quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting estimated breeding value for milk protein percentage (EBVP%). Milk pools prepared from high and low daughters of each of seven sires were genotyped for 138 dinucleotide microsatellites. Shadow-corrected estimates of sire allele frequencies were compared between high and low pools. An adjusted false discovery rate (FDR) method was employed to calculate experimentwise significance levels and empirical power. Significant associations with milk protein percentage were found for 61 of the markers (adjusted FDR = 0.10; estimated power, 0.68). The significant markers appear to be linked to 19--28 QTL. Mean allele substitution effects of the putative QTL averaged 0.016 (0.009--0.028) in units of the within-sire family standard deviation of EBVP% and summed to 0.460 EBVP%. Overall QTL heterozygosity was 0.40. The identified QTL appear to account for all of the variation in EBVP% in the population. Through use of selective DNA pooling, 4400 pool data points provided the statistical power of 600,000 individual data points.",2001,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""M O Mosig"", ids = ""10682622""); list(name = ""Ehud Lipkin"", ids = ""47829040""); list(name = ""Galina Khutoreskaya"", ids = ""7830014""); list(name = ""E.

6357b19f9f7c7eaef859dc255285f65379c5b2ff,Empirical Bayesian significance measure of neuronal spike response,"BackgroundFunctional connectivity analyses of multiple neurons provide a powerful bottom-up approach to reveal functions of local neuronal circuits by using simultaneous recording of neuronal activity. A statistical methodology, generalized linear modeling (GLM) of the spike response function, is one of the most promising methodologies to reduce false link discoveries arising from pseudo-correlation based on common inputs. Although recent advancement of fluorescent imaging techniques has increased the number of simultaneously recoded neurons up to the hundreds or thousands, the amount of information per pair of neurons has not correspondingly increased, partly because of the instrumentsâ€™ limitations, and partly because the number of neuron pairs increase in a quadratic manner. Consequently, the estimation of GLM suffers from large statistical uncertainty caused by the shortage in effective information.ResultsIn this study, we propose a new combination of GLM and empirical Bayesian testing for the estimation of spike response functions that enables both conservative false discovery control and powerful functional connectivity detection. We compared our proposed methodâ€™s performance with those of sparse estimation of GLM and classical Granger causality testing. Our method achieved high detection performance of functional connectivity with conservative estimation of false discovery rate and q values in case of information shortage due to short observation time. We also showed that empirical Bayesian testing on arbitrary statistics in place of likelihood-ratio statistics reduce the computational cost without decreasing the detection performance. When our proposed method was applied to a functional multi-neuron calcium imaging dataset from the rat hippocampal region, we found significant functional connections that are possibly mediated by AMPA and NMDA receptors.ConclusionsThe proposed empirical Bayesian testing framework with GLM is promising especially when the amount of information per a neuron pair is small because of growing size of observed network.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shigeyuki Oba"", ids = ""38809507""); list(name = ""Ken Nakae"", ids = ""1966945""); list(name = ""Yuji Ikegaya"", ids = ""2117619""); list(name = ""Shunsuke Aki"", ids = ""6760703""); list(name = ""Junichiro Yoshimoto"", ids = ""48853826""); list(name = ""Shin Ishii"", ids = ""47281682"")",,2afc2a16d8faca8fda70f8bd063f8feecf931efd; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; d206fe99db30e8c6a9b19b32ab812ee1f76ef538; d03359c29cbfac19bb3e10c0a6dbe4b63d7df2c8; e7f5ad1f6355ebfc7df5984994d6fa572a1e612e; 3940067800f9e50b4fd59cb24847577e1c03cfab; f45348b805d88492ef90c0f6de30b49bdb2f23cb; 3bb5a439a0d610a7eac68f73068cdd278b8c9775; 89f1ab720460423cc82bc695e3293602293ff6da; fdb44830dca75db75c0edf9a62e5c9ff92901832; 02e7d35b025964846e194100126a0adbb5490e44; 522a346bd04b63a93c26d7c3ed4b30fc3ea314ce; 2fbeef5ca17328590cf74353ff5654dad7800d67; f2e6480528fad346af5d658673f2b618411c1a25; b26e87c1f0e158f8fa901f427f39f204c5eafa49; f805ff22207a9a41ff3d46002c6e46590f0085cd; 8ef9089e41c726131a2a62f8e1e6be66cd30b482; 74eebbc23056acb83796673c6bb51dd41deb21db; 4400cc2af1c3e322c7aa4069c4e3b85a71121906; 2319d83c32a895d6713331c464ed794676cf43d8; 7a32213cea8011b7d504b67534a923a50e407b76; 3c58d3a01bd28e4a202d420346ec0a745db3414e; fd27a53f3fbc2389e5fe2106cdb7e73db706790e; bd2e048c676ad778351bd7d7660240a978422117; 326ceb2b80b4a1cc5cf91f5e4f37fe3497ebf154; a196c4e8b722615545041193eb6ce6ad14f60345; a9b85e9e61cd6046d3bb3b8bee1dd9a2417daeda; a15e20be900601d7c5a1da813dea011f70cca0f1,BMC Neuroscience,17,
e05426238e368317fb9a1caca79156a0c3b62a2c,"Cesarean Section, Formula Feeding, and Infant Antibiotic Exposure: Separate and Combined Impacts on Gut Microbial Changes in Later Infancy","Established during infancy, our complex gut microbial community is shaped by medical interventions and societal preferences, such as cesarean section, formula feeding, and antibiotic use. We undertook this study to apply the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) method to quantify changes in gut microbial composition during later infancy following the most common birth and postnatal exposures affecting infant gut microbial composition. Gut microbiota of 166 full-term infants in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development birth cohort were profiled using 16S high-throughput gene sequencing. Infants were placed into groups according to mutually exclusive combinations of birth mode (vaginal/cesarean birth), breastfeeding status (yes/no), and antibiotic use (yes/no) by 3â€‰months of age. Based on repeated permutations of data and adjustment for the false discovery rate, the SAM statistic identified statistically significant changes in gut microbial abundance between 3â€‰months and 1â€‰year of age within each infant group. We observed well-known patterns of microbial phyla succession in later infancy (declining Proteobacteria; increasing Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) following vaginal birth, breastfeeding, and no antibiotic exposure. Genus Lactobacillus, Roseburia, and Faecalibacterium species appeared in the top 10 increases to microbial abundance in these infants. Deviations from this pattern were evident among infants with other perinatal co-exposures; notably, the largest number of microbial species with unchanged abundance was seen in gut microbiota following early cessation of breastfeeding in infants. With and without antibiotic exposure, the absence of a breast milk diet by 3â€‰months of age following vaginal birth yielded a higher proportion of unchanged abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae in later infancy, and a higher ratio of unchanged Enterobacteriaceae to Alcaligenaceae microbiota. Gut microbiota of infants born vaginally and exclusively formula fed became less enriched with family Veillonellaceae and Clostridiaceae, showed unchanging levels of Ruminococcaceae, and exhibited a greater decline in the Rikenellaceae/Bacteroidaceae ratio compared to their breastfed, vaginally delivered counterparts. These changes were also evident in cesarean-delivered infants to a lesser extent. The clinical relevance of these trajectories of microbial change is that they culminate in taxon-specific abundances in the gut microbiota of later infancy, which we and others have observed to be associated with food sensitization.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Farzana Yasmin"", ids = ""3489206""); list(name = ""Hein Min Tun"", ids = ""2089449""); list(name = ""Theodore B.

24eacde34df7af812c4e3c95609d6f775cdccaf9,TCBB special section on the Brazilian symposium on bioinformatics 2013,"THIS issue of TCBB contains extended versions of works that were originally presented at the Brazilian Symposium on Bioinformatics 2013 (BSB 2013), held in Recife, Brazil, November 3-6, 2013. The Proceedings of BSB 2013 have been published by Springer Verlag, in volume 8213 of the Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics series (series editors: S. Istrail, P. Pevzner, and M. Waterman). Eighteen papers were presented at BSB 2013; four of these were invited for submission to a special section of TCBB. The invitation stipulated that the papers would have to be substantially expanded, and would undergo a new round of peer review. These fourmanuscripts were carefully evaluated by 11 international experts. The four papers nowpublished are the result of this process. Braga and Stoye study the well-known Double-cut-andjoin (DCJ)-indel theoretical model of genome evolution in â€œSorting Linear Genomes with Rearrangements and Indelsâ€. They present several new results concerning the computation of an evolutionary distance between two genomes under this model. Their main result is a proof that distances computed under a restricted version of the model and an unrestricted version are the same. Hoener zu Siederdissen, Hofacker, and Stadler present a theory of algebraic operations over linear grammars in â€œProduct Grammars for Alignment and Foldingâ€. This theory and its implementation make it possible to â€œmultiply togetherâ€ dynamic programming algorithms, a widely used technique in computational biology. The authors demonstrate that this framework provides a powerful tool for developing programs that would otherwise require a complex ad-hoc approach. As an example, they elegantly apply their framework to the problem of aligning protein sequences to DNA sequences in the presence of â€œediting frameshifts,â€ a real problem observed in the mitochondria of Physarum polycephalum, a slime mold, which is a model organism for styudying RNA editing. RNA molecules, in contrast to DNA, can take many different three-dimensional shapes. This is one reason why we find so many different kinds of RNAs in the cell, performing varied functions. Hoksza and Svozil present the program MultiSETTER, which allows multiple alignment of RNA sequences taking into account three-dimensional structural information in â€œMultiple 3D RNA Structure Superposition Using Neighbor Joiningâ€. This program is an extension of their previously-published pairwise-alignment program SETTER. The paper presents extensive experimental results, which show that MultiSETTER has accuracy as good as or in some case better than SETTER, while being substantially faster. The BLAST program for sequence comparison is arguably the most widely used computational tool used in all science. There are two basic elements to this success: the speed with which comparisons are made and the statistics of sequence similarity scores, encapsulated in the e-value statistic. Carroll, Williams, Davis, and Spouge improve on this venerable practice by introducing the false discovery rate (FDR) statistic into BLAST and PSI-BLAST in â€œImproving Retrieval Efficacy of Homology Searches Using the False Discovery Rateâ€. They show that their FDR-versions of these programs are better at separating relevant from irrelevant results, a welcome development for BLAST users. Together, these four papers cover a wide arc of results, from the most theoretical to the very practical, and are thus an excellent showcase of the work presented at BSB 2013 and of computational biology in general. We finalize by thanking the BSB 2013 program committee members as well as the reviewers for the papers invited to this special issue for their invaluable help in the review process.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""JoÃ£o Carlos Setubal"", ids = ""1747863""); list(name = ""Nalvo F. de Almeida"", ids = ""50489357"")",,,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,12 3,"

483fa7972cbafa0603d24e6626e69574b5cf09f0,213 Transcriptomic Comparison between Porcine Adipose and Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells during in Vitro Osteogenic and Adipogenic Differentiation,"Previous data support the use of adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) as an alternative to bone marrow as a source of adult stem cells for therapeutic purposes. The aims of the present study were to directly compare the transcriptome of ASC and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) in order to uncover potential functional differences between the two mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) and related functions that may drive MSC to become bone or adipose and to identify potential markers for adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. ASC and BMSC, isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue and femurs of 3 adult pigs were differentiated in vitro along the osteogenic and adipogenic lineage for up to 4 wk. At 0, 2, 7 and 21 days of differentiation, RNA was extracted for microarray analysis. Data were normalized by Lowess and statistical analysis run using ANOVA with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Data mining was carried out using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and DAVID. Analysis of undifferentiated MSC for genes with the highest expression and DEG between MSC and fully differentiated tissues uncovered MSC being featured by low immunity and high angiogenic capacity. The direct comparison between differentiation lineages indicated that the expression of a limited number of genes has to change in order to determine cell fate. Functional analysis of the DEG between differentiation lineages indicated that osteogenesis is characterised by larger cell proliferation and cytoskeleton organisation with a crucial role of G-proteins compared to adipogenesis. On the other hand, adipogenesis is driven by PPAR signalling, has greater angiogenesis, lipid metabolism, migration and tumorigenesis capacity compared to osteogenesis. The direct comparison between ASC and BMSC during the same differentiation uncovered that ASC is featured by a greater lipid metabolism compared to BMSC, while BMSC has a more pronounced cell growth and proliferation than ASC. In addition, we uncovered 39 specific gene markers for adipogenesis and 65 for osteogenesis. NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1), aquaporin 3 (AQP3), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty acid binding protein 3 and 5 (FABP3 and FABP5) and ferritin light polypeptide (FTL) were among the best adipogenic markers. Hemopexin (HPX), collagenase type 3Î± (COL3A1), annexin A8-like 1 (ANXA8L1), flotillin 2 (FLOT2) and periostin or osteoblast specific factor (POSTN) were among the best osteogenic markers. Overall, the data indicated that the transcriptome of the two MSC are similar across the conditions studied. In addition, despite the limited DEG between the two MSC, the enrichment of several functions/pathways might indicate differences in therapeutic application.

4eacca5b4a7dfaf88ad3c27ad54ba9f217b767e2,Cerebellar Neural Circuits Involving Executive Control Network Predict Response to Group Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Social Anxiety Disorder,"Some intrinsic connectivity networks including the default mode network (DMN) and executive control network (ECN) may underlie social anxiety disorder (SAD). Although the cerebellum has been implicated in the pathophysiology of SAD and several networks relevant to higher-order cognition, it remains unknown whether cerebellar areas involved in DMN and ECN exhibit altered resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) with cortical networks in SAD. Forty-six patients with SAD and 64 healthy controls (HC) were included and submitted to the baseline resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Seventeen SAD patients who completed post-treatment clinical assessments were included after group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). RsFC of three cerebellar subregions in both groups was assessed respectively in a voxel-wise way, and these rsFC maps were compared by two-sample t tests between groups. Whole-brain voxel-wise regression was performed to examine whether cerebellar connectivity networks can predict response to CBT. Lower rsFC circuits of cerebellar subregions compared with HC at baseline (pÂ <Â 0.05, corrected by false discovery rate) were revealed. The left Crus I rsFC with dorsal medial prefrontal cortex was negatively correlated with symptom severity. The clinical assessments in SAD patients were significantly decreased after CBT. Higher pretreatment cerebellar rsFC with angular gyrus and dorsal lateral frontal cortex corresponded with greater symptom improvement following CBT. Cerebellar rsFC circuits involving DMN and ECN are possible neuropathologic mechanisms of SAD. Stronger pretreatment cerebellar rsFC circuits involving ECN suggest potential neural markers to predict CBT response.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""MinlanYuan"", ids = ""8796306""); list(name = ""Yajing Meng"", ids = ""7691747""); list(name = ""Yan Zhang"", ids = ""1591140646""); list(name = ""Xiaojing Nie"", ids = ""40609537""); list(name = ""Zhengjia Ren"", ids = ""6873633""); list(name = ""Hongru Zhu"", ids = ""7296567""); list(name = ""Yuchen Li"", ids = ""47001555""); list(name = ""Su Lui"", ids = ""145965433""); list(name = ""Qiyong Gong"", ids = ""48814194""); list(name = ""Changjian Qiu"", ids = ""3386453""); list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""145957338"")",bfe7c9766319e8ac12b65820b6d92b9db272a30a; 8973fca61fcaf0dc39d7d88a8e61119856eaa812; 67e5d50363224b83f6d052824bf4df0d41524e86; 67c91e49db36008bd0ce5204c15eb4f149f58ab2,a9bb6b70065d3a5c31012887134b357db0c2c314; 338bfe37e98a99065b8d03df695ee157ca92dba9; 51a480fdc17654ae22b8b9fc52d2000ead7be933; 084a04d1c8264016e6a8d65b4cd6df8c426562e3; c608fee16847f6fa56d7ef55ce170a70e55c1827; 659ab79dfe58416c2c881b05357af154be849d99; d41904fb1ea87562c0a99b9de21ed02963c920d6; 3a5a9d184d6cbb281183ee9499aae850b5b267d0; e5f178a124c5258e1202746857622238a37f42b2; 251a4b3f9a673073e01eb922033fac2050191b38; 4af84fe665a02dc10416c6b2d99735523f7c2934; f918497ee48e34b49fc981ed74322cb80e2acf68; 65ab3415072bded398074af8ecc57f410ed75b07; 165fd770b8893f8511852d44f4d4ac7241eebeeb; ba86f82b570d84fa0a9bd2cd2f269592c6385614; e20c3ad8feae7015f136c6dceadc314474a08c6d; 0455613ac98708f605d486d3ba26e26bd01be59c; 21a8d5cf76d27a6ce2d0480a6aac0200dafb6ed4; fcb553010bee2727f10f251352b64f7576666b1a; 6a388298dec96974d9160dce00a133d850ea29d0; d230a20951732b3089785b7fef775b2fdfd4cd5c; de410a2db23ddb40034bab7b021d5d4d9efacc58; dff53f2c692a5aa98013e148ff668933625af658; c953006b5a690c2aab65caa9c833f64671e451e1; 9044ddd7ed1a0c50ab710a08d586106ac4b26b76; e77264e94d40e1d64670819a7178cfd72ab3c11f; 539b259e781a58f3a041ab7dc03ee9108ee37c75; 8a3a5df42b6b127346fbe1a208af3516f269248a; 6be0056b17d4b5a48c06b146f977d7a06d936c49; 9ce36f6e8cf0e0eed784c2855f6a6e7091a3dce9; 3949b877728a65f207cbebd298680bfb166737a9; cd309ca6d59e8ddfc6f24933f1a56a4197e27bb1; 8a65c8d746d67f0ed7c4307dceb6e1c31d014633; 641fbec56ec55c19e724aff4ebf55af864b3c656; b3629e697bfc9c7c8fc015062cc94389f82607ec; ca9100bd89dfce0588a094da40ce50b6bf9c1b8e; 0570ff70c04664c88a57598ec811264570912e2e; b8cac158a294c11981b22db33ed554bc6a53c6dc; 1b237f8059d594b1eebc866c213a666991614e8b; 78724969b7aa5248e7ee1f5c411bb878f1355190; 7adcbdb0740b049de735c02cc72c52e1d15ded87; cd684853e43ae14cce065bc35b27278e824ecde0; a34d61ecb6e3fd8a9700c16234212d5de8fb430f; 8c28caad5c4286e4cde8a73703ad5bc00c199d84; 10f40c03551bc95e6815be7c31ab28883d395a93; 046802ddfd47ef36b8a0079e5deec0ca82bbeb50; 4e24f9eddcc8f6bc12585e45ae098a97a6abe358; c9d1140a4ec415ac5dad42a065a81c0ab4e94c05; 7be869d02c2239f0427ffaca529fc720f65ddfff; 0946b1536a93b0ebe8ca8c995a71911584ecde26; e6d09d04fc8737094c193da471e2a50a809f77d4; b8a047e79837e2ceccfe00324c4130772f4cfb47; 78f59bbd638fe961c7b1f53604bee3a09e7986a8; 542ef736e239674e1d58834ba0b1f02373a41cbd; 2af4d11bf7f8692c329ccfdde421c26980a55560; ea57664bb7711258d713f15ce1bb8e69a3aa6ceb,The Cerebellum,16,673-682
7e9de028e6d7714dd70e4fc7b1d9d983e5de9678,Metabolic compounds within the porcine uterine environment are unique to the type of conceptus present during the early stages of blastocyst elongation,"The objective of this study was to identify metabolites within the porcine uterine milieu during the early stages of blastocyst elongation. At Days 9, 10, or 11 of gestation, reproductive tracts of White cross-bred gilts (nâ€‰=â€‰38) were collected immediately following harvest and flushed with Roswell Park Memorial Institute-1640 medium. Conceptus morphologies were assessed from each pregnancy and corresponding uterine flushings were assigned to one of five treatment groups based on these morphologies: (a) uniform spherical (nâ€‰=â€‰8); (b) heterogeneous spherical and ovoid (nâ€‰=â€‰8); (c) uniform ovoid (nâ€‰=â€‰8); (d) heterogeneous ovoid and tubular (nâ€‰=â€‰8); and (e) uniform tubular (nâ€‰=â€‰6). Uterine flushings from these pregnancies were submitted for nontargeted profiling by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-MS techniques. Unsupervised multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using pcaMethods and univariate analysis of variance was performed in R with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment. PCA analysis of the GC-MS and UPLC-MS data identified 153 and 104 metabolites, respectively. After FDR adjustment of the GC-MS and UPLC-MS data, 38 and 59 metabolites, respectively, differed (pâ€‰<â€‰.05) in uterine flushings from pregnancies across the five conceptus stages. Some metabolites were greater (pâ€‰â€‰<â€‰.05) in abundance for uterine flushings containing earlier stage conceptuses (i.e., spherical), such as uric acid, tryptophan, and tyrosine. In contrast, some metabolites were greater (pâ€‰<â€‰.05) in abundance for uterine flushings containing later stage conceptuses (i.e., tubular), such as creatinine, serine, and urea. These data illustrate several putative metabolites that change within the uterine milieu during early porcine blastocyst elongation.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sophie C Walsh"", ids = ""1470724405""); list(name = ""Jeremy R Miles"", ids = ""3866228""); list(name = ""Linxing Yao"", ids = ""120271092""); list(name = ""Corey D Broeckling"", ids = ""3828336""); list(name = ""Lea A Rempel"", ids = ""5160690""); list(name = ""Elane C Wright-Johnson"", ids = ""1422154763""); list(name = ""Angela K.

2938045f3292d182402dd073209ab58b7dff4c68,Adaptive designs: looking for a needle in the haystack-a new challenge in medical research.,"The statistical principles of fully adaptive designs are outlined. The options of flexibility and the price to be paid in terms of statistical properties of the test procedures are discussed. It is stressed that controlled inference after major design modifications (changing hypotheses) will include a penalty: Intersections among all the hypotheses considered throughout the trial have to be rejected before testing individual hypotheses. Moreover, feasibility in terms of integrity and persuasiveness of the results achieved after adaptations based on unblinded data is considered as the crucial issue in practice. In the second part, sample size adaptive procedures are considered testing a large number of hypotheses under constraints on total sample size as in genetic studies. The advantage of sequential procedures is sketched for the example of two-stage designs with a pilot phase for screening promising hypotheses (markers) and controlling the false discovery rate. Finally, we turn to the clinical problem how to select markers and estimate a score from limited samples, e.g. for predicting the response to therapy of a future patient. The predictive ability of such scores will be rather poor when investigating a large number of hypotheses and truly large marker effects are lacking. An obvious dilemma will show up: More optimistic selection rules may be superior if in fact effective markers exist, but will produce more nuisance prediction if no effective markers exist compared with more cautious strategies, e.g. aiming at some control of type I error probabilities.",2008,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Peter Bauer"", ids = ""145849144"")",dca7ab21bdacaea20bd8c49226338f573248d237; e97db076c4af6bd446d09bc991597dd1b32fe335; 6f1f3e044f6bb6be26ee05583bae19d0e2dd7076; cc4f43110917dd11a18133476131bec946ed5468; 7a678129c347ffce95883952c7558fc4a1f0c3cb; d75f822284eba43c4f4c25193812e27ed8a202d5; c1a76525311a4d0c94c70694a97e2b2eb8f2b0f0; 465026b4a7f2fd192307cd543227eb04c9e957f3; 7dd559fc7a2d83cb688107e64dc6e92afc2d42dc; 17dc5a05bbc0d015db51dc9b73fdd64933e241db,7cd3a042203cd1c3e65554f506706a0d96e1928a; 3938d5670dd8b92ed85c8283564c3b4eade75661; b6eb9d8b8e4c0e53281e543bcfc4576dce830241; b872af483adb03dfa91262ca4f20af3751dc63ea; d7200da445c0a95a91816e577824ff46b26be9b9; 1156f895a3c2823ff757121b74a9afc5f9552ca8; 80279f16590d537b29c546136b41c2b40aa49709; b2b16a9bf487b00f80801ff57c7cbb96503a9e81; 48b8ae6a9f426fb516c41de6d80cf2d01329e2b5; c4d2e75fd0d96d3688051903a69d8134ce56b9cd; 1fb526486ba7737fad60ee235b50fd63a2aded30; d3bbf5e028eb59abdf62ddfda64f7eb2b153b09e; de8d79f2012457e6acffc1acead260a9ed1bd7fa; a603812c1e0aeb46d02c86a2668276c9a5f0bed6; 9bbabccca7f9bd6b3c82190105e4950115c5a080; bbdc54ec0e9e55a00fd130022f22c0c27914193a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 21bb71b319065ef622a4df0bde69b70fbcd0baa3; b4a6a23739d8a241f22eb86b150bef8a279922b4; bff1cdc1a299e9f0525b44bf93155ce9d6a19207; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 94cbf53015b9d952fa48503adb8dbdb93c242fdd; 89893a5a56a8817eb614cc10ab5d0ebb5a088dd0; 23f97aa433d131680de6dcb10833d6d257f2799c; b60df81768c1e27af887d682c4c9e2524f2e8fe8; 83db7b97ffccb45f1f76a619b595acd3995339ce; 78e7023e2a11b60307606d571dcb580a0e2c6887; 154bbeafb23144ca2374afdedd1a83786fff449f; 86f4aa12501032eecdbfe1394e99eb017f5d1b27; 007f017b17db41e96718d3da10459cd431c544f7; 6da8f53260dc812b814afb0f249b042787417dad; cef006ff8559f1638ab836b58a031e460b17f45f; b2142e512677925dfbc809f22bc46020f6871002; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; fb452b24e3af50f628f5b5377fab1cc7f39bad86,Statistics in medicine,27 10,"

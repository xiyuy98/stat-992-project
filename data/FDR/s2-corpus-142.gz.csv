9adec620cfba48ce9c0e03551f8419552838118c,Predicting bioprocess targets of chemical compounds through integration of chemical-genetic and genetic interactions,"Chemical-genetic interactions-observed when the treatment of mutant cells with chemical compounds reveals unexpected phenotypes-contain rich functional information linking compounds to their cellular modes of action. To systematically identify these interactions, an array of mutants is challenged with a compound and monitored for fitness defects, generating a chemical-genetic interaction profile that provides a quantitative, unbiased description of the cellular function(s) perturbed by the compound. Genetic interactions, obtained from genome-wide double-mutant screens, provide a key for interpreting the functional information contained in chemical-genetic interaction profiles. Despite the utility of this approach, integrative analyses of genetic and chemical-genetic interaction networks have not been systematically evaluated. We developed a method, called CG-TARGET (Chemical Genetic Translation via A Reference Genetic nETwork), that integrates large-scale chemical-genetic interaction screening data with a genetic interaction network to predict the biological processes perturbed by compounds. In a recent publication, we applied CG-TARGET to a screen of nearly 14,000 chemical compounds in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, integrating this dataset with the global S. cerevisiae genetic interaction network to prioritize over 1500 compounds with high-confidence biological process predictions for further study. We present here a formal description and rigorous benchmarking of the CG-TARGET method, showing that, compared to alternative enrichment-based approaches, it achieves similar or better accuracy while substantially improving the ability to control the false discovery rate of biological process predictions. Additional investigation of the compatibility of chemical-genetic and genetic interaction profiles revealed that one-third of observed chemical-genetic interactions contributed to the highest-confidence biological process predictions and that negative chemical-genetic interactions overwhelmingly formed the basis of these predictions. We also present experimental validations of CG-TARGET-predicted tubulin polymerization and cell cycle progression inhibitors. Our approach successfully demonstrates the use of genetic interaction networks in the high-throughput functional annotation of compounds to biological processes.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Scott W.

9a12cd0f3f4d5c219f9cd286ffa89ada57cae848,Gene Expression Pro fi les in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of Chinese Nickel Re fi nery Workers with High Exposures to Nickel and Control Subjects,"Background: Occupational exposure to nickel (Ni) is associated with an increased risk of lung and nasal cancers. Ni compounds exhibit weak mutagenic activity, alter the cellâ€™s epigenetic homeostasis, and activate signaling pathways. However, changes in gene expression associated with Ni exposure have only been investigated in vitro. This study was conducted in a Chinese population to determine whether occupational exposure to Ni was associated with differential gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of Ni-refinery workers when compared with referents. Methods: Eight Ni-refinery workers and ten referents were selected. PBMC RNA was extracted and gene expression profiling was conducted using Affymetrix exon arrays. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) between both groups were identified in a global analysis. Results: Therewere a total of 2,756 DEGs in theNi-refineryworkers relative to the referents [false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P < 0.05] with 770 upregulated genes and 1,986 downregulated genes. DNA repair and epigenetic genes were significantly overrepresented (P < 0.0002) among the DEGs. Of 31 DNA repair genes, 29 were repressed in the Ni-refinery workers and 2 were overexpressed. Of the 16 epigenetic genes, 12 were repressed in the Ni-refinery workers and 4 were overexpressed. Conclusions:The results of this study indicate that occupational exposure toNi is associatedwith alterations in gene expression profiles in PBMCs of subjects. Impact: Gene expression may be useful in identifying patterns of deregulation that precede clinical identification of Ni-induced cancers.

Darbysh. = Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort. = Festuca arundinacea var. arundinacea Schreb.] plant genotypes with an EpichloÃ« coenophiala (Morgan-Jones & W. Gams) C.W. Bacon & Schardl common toxic endophyte (CTE), one with a nontoxic strain (NTE19) and one with another EpichloÃ« species (FaTG-4) were evaluated and compared with their respective endophyte-free clones for responses to water-deficit stress in the greenhouse. One of the plant genotypes (P27) showed a positive effect of its CTE strain on tiller production after stress and resumed watering. In transcriptome analysis of the pseudostems (leaf sheath whorls), differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as having at least twofold expression difference and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 in comparisons of water treatment (stressed or watered), endophyte presence or absence, or both. Stress affected 38% of the plant transcripts including those for the expected stress-response pathways. The DEGs affected by endophyte in stressed plants were unique to individual plant genotypes. In unstressed plants, endophyte presence tended to reduce expression of genes putatively for defense against fungi, but in unstressed P27 endophyte presence there was enhanced expression of dehydrin and heat shock protein genes. Our results indicated subtle and variable effects of endophytes on tall fescue gene expression; where the endophyte confers protection, its effects on plant gene expression may help prime the plant for stress resistance.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Randy D.

5bb9a97483d4b84f05e8a8047ed8a53e789d9952,Genome-wide association study for body weight in cattle populations from Siberia.,"Body weight is a complex trait in cattle associated with commonly used commercial breeding measurements related to growth. Although many quantitative trait loci (QTL) for body weight have been identified in cattle so far, searching for genetic determinants in different breeds or environments is promising. Therefore, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in two cattle populations from the Russian Federation (Siberian region) using the GGP HD150K array containing 139Â 376 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Association tests for 107Â 550 SNPs left after filtering revealed five statistically significant SNPs on BTA5, considering a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. The chromosomal region containing these five SNPs contains the CCND2 gene, which was previously associated with average daily weight gain and body mass index in US beef cattle populations and in humans respectively. Our study is the first GWAS for body weight in beef cattle populations from the Russian Federation. The results provided here suggest that, despite the existence of breed- and species-specific QTL, the genetic architecture of body weight could be evolutionarily conserved in mammals.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexander V.

Objective:To evaluate the independent and overlapping patterns of GM atrophy in normal aging and AD. Methods:A total of 169 cognitively normal subjects and 33 persons with probable AD enrolled in the longitudinal Cardiovascular Health Studyâ€“Cognition Study underwent 3-dimensional volumetric MRI scans. Controls remained cognitively normal for at least 5 years after their MRI scans and the probable AD subjects were relatively early in their clinical course with an average modified Mini-Mental State Examination score of 76/100. The scans were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry adjusting for total intracranial volume, gender, education, and race. Results:With older age, GM volume was lower in the sensorimotor and heteromodal association areas in frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes, as well as in the cerebellum (false discovery rate p = 0.05). Additional atrophy was observed in the posterior hippocampus, thalamus, and middle cingulate gyrus. By contrast, atrophy was seen in subjects with AD in the anterior hippocampal/parahippocampal regions and the precuneus. Normal aging and AD overlapped in the hippocampal body and the entorhinal cortex. Conclusion:Brain atrophy with aging was observed in supratentorial and infratentorial areas, as well in primary motor, sensory, and heteromodal association regions. Age and Alzheimer disease exert independent gray matter atrophy patterns but these effects overlapped substantially in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.

b1c8bb283c6a9e829098d76f441d694cc52c8169,Motion detection with false discovery rate control,"Visual surveillance applications such as object identification, object tracking, and anomaly detection require reliable motion detection as an initial processing step. Such a detection is often accomplished by means of background subtraction which can be as simple as thresholding of intensity difference between movement-free background and current frame. However, more effective background subtraction methods employ probabilistic modeling of the background followed by probability thresholding. In this case, the balance between false positives and false negatives (misses) is controlled by a threshold that needs to be adjusted heuristically depending on object sparsity. In this paper, we propose a different detection method that is based on false discovery rate control, a multiple-comparison procedure that applies thresholding in significance-score rather than probability space. The proposed approach allows explicit control of false positives and automatically adapts to object sparsity. The new method offers a qualitative improvement in real scenarios as well as a measurable performance gain over non-adaptive techniques when tested on synthetic sequences.",2008,Computer Science,"list(name = ""J.

5588eb5325bd31acefe06079ba5216f53d28e7a4,Detection of quantitative trait loci influencing conformation traits and calving ease in Holstein-Friesian cattle.,"An extension of our previous genome scan of a North American Holstein-Friesian population was conducted to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting conformation traits. Resource families consisted of 1404 sons of 10 elite sires. Genome coverage was estimated to be 2713.5 cM (90%) for 406 markers using a granddaughter design. Regression interval mapping was used to detect QTL affecting 22 conformation traits, including body, udder, feet and legs, and dairy conformation as well as calving ease. Analysis of the families jointly identified 41 chromosome-wise significant QTL influencing conformation traits and 3 significant QTL influencing calving ease on 20 chromosomes. The false discovery rate method was used to account for multiple testing and 3/4 of the suggestive and 5/6 of significant QTL should be real effects. Fourteen of the 44 QTL were significant at the genome-wise level. Comparison of these results with other published reports identifies common QTL affecting conformation traits. Regions on 10 chromosomes appear to affect multiple traits, including conformation, milk production, and somatic cell score, within these particular US Holstein families. Additional work is needed to determine the precise locations of the QTL and select positional candidate genes influencing these traits.",2005,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Melissa S.

5a3768dbdb4f4a56951d13f11ae083c27f8ffd8b,Identification of differential gene pathways with principal component analysis,"MOTIVATION
Development of high-throughput technology makes it possible to measure expressions of thousands of genes simultaneously. Genes have the inherent pathway structure, where pathways are composed of multiple genes with coordinated biological functions. It is of great interest to identify differential gene pathways that are associated with the variations of phenotypes.


RESULTS
We propose the following approach for detecting differential gene pathways. First, we construct gene pathways using databases such as KEGG or GO. Second, for each pathway, we extract a small number of representative features, which are linear combinations of gene expressions and/or their transformations. Specifically, we propose using (i) principal components (PCs) of gene expression sets, (ii) PCs of expanded gene expression sets and (iii) expanded sets of PCs of gene expressions, as the representative features. Third, we identify differential gene pathways as those with representative features significantly associated with the variations of phenotypes, particularly disease clinical outcomes, in regression models. The false discovery rate approach is used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Analysis of three gene expression datasets suggests that (i) the proposed approach can effectively identify differential gene pathways; (ii) PCs that explain only a small amount of variations of gene expressions may bear significant associations between gene pathways and phenotypes; (iii) including second-order terms of gene expressions may lead to identification of new differential gene pathways; (iv) the proposed approach is relatively insensitive to additional noises; and (v) the proposed approach can identify gene pathways missed by alternative approaches.

941ce0f575f2417cbaff6185d665412353f31e87,Mining Beneficial Genes for Aluminum Tolerance Within a Core Collection of Rice Landraces Through Genome-Wide Association Mapping With High Density SNPs From Specific-Locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing,"Trivalent Aluminum (Al3+) in acidic soils is harmful to root growth and significantly reduce crop yields. Therefore, mining beneficial genes for Al tolerance is valuable for rice production. The objective of this research is to identify some beneficial genes for Al tolerance from rice landraces with high density SNP set from SLAF-seq (Specific-Locus Amplified Fragment sequencing). A total of 67,511 SNPs were obtained from SLAF-seq and used for genome-wide association study (GWAS) for Al tolerance with the 150 accessions of rice landraces in the Ting's rice core collection. The results showed that rice landraces in the Ting's rice core collection possessed a wide-range of variation for Al tolerance, measured by relative root elongation (RRE). With the mixed linear models, GWAS identified a total of 25 associations between SNPs and Al tolerant trait with p < 0.001 and false discovery rate (FDR) <10%.

Five of twenty five QTLs identified in this study were co-localized with the previously cloned genes or previously identified QTLs related to Al tolerance or root growth/development.

1cee7244ebb8e7d1d15c74ec72ae7e817ece4ba0,Comparison of Statistical Testing and Predictive Analysis Methods for Feature Selection in Zero-inflated Microbiome Data,"Background: Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology enable researchers to collect a large volume of microbiome data. Microbiome data consist of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) count data characterized by zero-inflation, over-dispersion, and grouping structure among the sample. Currently, statistical testing methods based on generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMM) are commonly performed to identify OTUs that are associated with a phenotype such as human diseases or plant traits. There are a number of limitations for statistical testing methods including these two: (1) the validity of p-value/q-value depends sensitively on the correctness of models, and (2) the statistical significance does not necessarily imply predictivity. Statistic testing methods depend on model correctness and attempt to select â€marginally relevantâ€ features, not the most predictive ones. 
Predictive analysis using methods such as LASSO is an alternative approach for feature selection. To the best of our knowledge, this approach has not been used widely for analyzing microbiome data. 

Methodology: We use four synthetic datasets simulated from zero-inflated negative binomial distribution and a real human gut microbiome data to compare the feature selection performance of LASSO with the likelihood ratio test methods applied to GLMMs. We also investigate the performance of cross-validation in estimating the out-of-sample predictivity of selected features in zero-inflated data. 

Results: Our studies with synthetic datasets show that the feature selection performance of LASSO is remarkably excellent in zero-inflated data and is comparable with the likelihood ratio test applied to the true data generating model. The feature selection performance of LASSO is better when the distributions of counts are more differentiated by the phenotype, which is a categorical variable in our synthetic datasets. 

In addition, we performed LOOCV on the train set and out-of-sample prediction on the test set. The performance of the cross-validatory (CV) predictive measures are very close to the out-of-sample predictivity measures. This indicates that LOOCV predictive metrics provide honest measures of the predictivity of the features selected by LASSO. 
Therefore, the CV predictive measures are good guidance for choosing cutoffs (shrinkage parameter $\lambda$) in selecting features with LASSO. By contrast, when wrong models are fitted to a dataset, the differences between the q-values and the actual false discovery rates are huge; hence, their q-values are tremendously misleading for selecting features. 
Our comparison of LASSO and statistical testing methods (likelihood ratio test in our analysis) in the real dataset shows that small q-values do not necessarily imply high predictivity of the selected OTUs. However, the researchers often use q-values to find the predictors. That is why we need to look at q-values carefully.

Conclusions: Statistical testing methods perform greatly in zero-inflated datasets on both synthetic and realâ€¦",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Xiaoying Wang"", ids = ""50141906"")",,714bd8f8de0982919f2e2954d208e62a22719b7d; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; a67dcab1090cb1749b180d9eb1959cc1801e9817; 4327b2a88b8d0796382956ff4cd76c26947ebb68; b29549b3889606db6126fae89d66c4bea7c95a63; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; f7cb06b4a62f4db0df054d112e381e74a015d4cf; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; b5f0e4824fa598942859f64890d2520ff3eb6f30; fa0f05b6c48120083dd4cc07b85fe22a2e8f6030; e184ce6b3effb6d43c7236118087a77a635b0103; 56c2b288c1701fc2786a00c87fc34234c164173c; 82ca6b2bd24489099c2463ed58e04a646e681aad; ab2e4c745060da05923b983d4ef9080ced068ec0; 9e18ce41e1feacbc7de48d2f66756a5b7f8a07da; b428e2f5739c8efac75c465fa6df7aec844bb1e7; 1016e40b12899d3f409166ada638e1bf62edeb63; 44c28138fb1b4f6ab76a72cca59e78e8b1a2e269; 72f827598b661dbe7f9601061c9dceedd0534a89; aa50e40bb21fbbd645303974eb84e320aa150104; a9dd93b39a2b4dd4bd0ec73c88582547610eeee7; 9f903dd2547cdc6fa79ef7450e4b1af42d2f0557; 9e9fea00e8adaaf2b658948e767b46a8ee2cd152; eae0002a07fd6c2a137dba78fbb5bf462026e37a; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 6983a4b9792ad690bea53aba39b2cda4a35cc3f8; 80fa99d95f9012def4876e6894aff95ed5809588; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e38d3faa4017e163fcaf95ccee8ae9b53e2c9fdc,,,

7c21a8c2e924e82331ee4d65a826b6e338f5b5d8,Relationship of a variant in the NTRK1 gene to white matter microstructure in young adults.,"The NTRK1 gene (also known as TRKA) encodes a high-affinity receptor for NGF, a neurotrophin involved in nervous system development and myelination. NTRK1 has been implicated in neurological function via links between the T allele at rs6336 (NTRK1-T) and schizophrenia risk. A variant in the neurotrophin gene, BDNF, was previously associated with white matter integrity in young adults, highlighting the importance of neurotrophins to white matter development. We hypothesized that NTRK1-T would relate to lower fractional anisotropy in healthy adults. We scanned 391 healthy adult human twins and their siblings (mean age: 23.6 Â± 2.2 years; 31 NTRK1-T carriers, 360 non-carriers) using 105-gradient diffusion tensor imaging at 4 tesla. We evaluated in brain white matter how NTRK1-T and NTRK1 rs4661063 allele A (rs4661063-A, which is in moderate linkage disequilibrium with rs6336) related to voxelwise fractional anisotropy-a common diffusion tensor imaging measure of white matter microstructure. We used mixed-model regression to control for family relatedness, age, and sex. The sample was split in half to test reproducibility of results. The false discovery rate method corrected for voxelwise multiple comparisons. NTRK1-T and rs4661063-A correlated with lower white matter fractional anisotropy, independent of age and sex (multiple-comparisons corrected: false discovery rate critical p = 0.038 for NTRK1-T and 0.013 for rs4661063-A). In each half-sample, the NTRK1-T effect was replicated in the cingulum, corpus callosum, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior corona radiata, and uncinate fasciculus.

We examined the association between 799 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 39 sex hormone genes and blood pressure (BP) responses to a dietary-sodium intervention.


METHODS
A 7-day low-sodium feeding study (51.3 mmol sodium/day) followed by a 7-day high-sodium feeding study (307.8 mmol sodium/day) was conducted among 1,906 Han Chinese participants. Nine BP measurements were obtained at baseline and the end of each intervention period using a random-zero sphygmomanometer.


RESULTS
Among men, absolute BP responses to sodium interventions decreased with the number of minor alleles of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) markers rs9340844, rs9397453, rs9371562, rs9397459, and rs9383951. For example, mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) responses to low-sodium intervention (95% confidence interval) were -2.67 (-3.13, -2.22) mm Hg among those with the rs9397453 C/C genotype, -1.23 (-1.98, -0.48) mm Hg among those with the C/T genotype, and 0.08 (-2.31, 2.47) mm Hg among those with the T/T genotype (P = 1Ã—10(-4); false discovery rate (FDR)-q = 0.04). Mean DBP responses to high sodium according to the rs9397453 genotypes were 1.46 (1.03, 1.89) mm Hg among those with C/C, 0.19 (-0.54, 0.91) mm Hg among those with C/T, and -1.10 (-2.82, 0.61) mm Hg among those with T/T (P = 2Ã—10(-4); FDR-q = 0.04). Similar trends were noted for the association between these ESR1 variants and SBP responses to the dietary intervention. There were no significant associations between sex hormone gene variants and salt sensitivity in women, with genotype-gender interactions noted for the ESR1 markers that achieved significance in men.


CONCLUSIONS
We identified strong, consistent associations between ESR1 gene variants and salt sensitivity in men.

e42bade12b3d901092e0fcc882914c49cf25dfac,Semi-Penalized Inference with Direct False Discovery Rate Control in High-Dimensions,"We propose a new method, semi-penalized inference with direct false discovery rate control (SPIDR), for variable selection and confidence interval construction in high-dimensional linear regression. SPIDR first uses a semi-penalized approach to constructing estimators of the regression coefficients. We show that the SPIDR estimator is ideal in the sense that it equals an ideal least squares estimator with high probability under a sparsity and other suitable conditions. Consequently, the SPIDR estimator is asymptotically normal. Based on this distributional result, SPIDR determines the selection rule by directly controlling false discovery rate. This provides an explicit assessment of the selection error. This also naturally leads to confidence intervals for the selected coefficients with a proper confidence statement. We conduct simulation studies to evaluate its finite sample performance and demonstrate its application on a breast cancer gene expression data set. Our simulation studies and data example suggest that SPIDR is a useful method for high-dimensional statistical inference in practice.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jian Huang"", ids = ""50535672""); list(name = ""Shuangge Ma"", ids = ""144072410""); list(name = ""Cun-Hui Zhang"", ids = ""1771912""); list(name = ""Yong Zhou"", ids = ""51461709"")",5e1be12bd2ca049097643b1b955cdbc84d7e2a7e; 987e87b5e27293d0b747e55d318f7eabab209b94; fa7c6124e70dbd6017a43c045adee1763aa36aac; bd1233f3707a76684f8801741de78b4bf879f643,5c7416638acf9836d0bd2dbb5c269c8e07604ad4; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; eddb3766525ad09e831933782f9d210e15449065; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; d4ff7059aead6b8771f2259bed1c9232d95d28dc; c67136ab0e52283d5b3beef23fe318eb9f455cb7; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; 7cd1619370c1ab9b68acbb05d91b6562c78ed8a8; 6410ec306cfec30aa85d2172ac9eba1ef5bea4cc; 9b6b90bc063ab68db41d97629aa93ead138da3f7; c3620866f75cf4d2cd498abc91b598ae1ddd1300; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; cf6da91d65cf8f01c4708fd95044e55fa495478c; 6ca19a7ba29e421ffb130ecf3d66230fff570ee5; 4d999d8f888d51e1a7bc33f9b37a1146a066227d; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; fe96483ba3f34ca4565e81a5cb130f66c02cf681; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc; e946b26d1b4edbef37dc6636ae5f259a22f3d9e3; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; 112e2d4f6ffbfba004576a159ffdf60f5dad8d3a; 46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; 9ae5d584339143d4d97bed0eff1978bb3761b9a5; b8db0ca28c530dd0d0671af5d1a1c238a5a03fee; 3144fd8159330301801edc4c50b68a4e8643b03d,arXiv: Methodology,,
863cf0158215644d56adc4150fd9e1b82f20f37a,Alignment of Tractograms as Linear Assignment Problem,"Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) offers a unique approach to study the structural connectivity of the brain. DMRI allows to reconstruct the 3D pathways of axons within the white matter as a set of polylines (streamlines), called the tractogram. Tractograms of different brains need to be aligned in a common representation space for various purposes, such as group-analysis, segmentation or atlas construction. Typically, such alignment is obtained with affine registration, through which tractograms are globally transformed, with the limit of not reconciling local differences. In this paper, we propose to improve registration-based alignment by what we call mapping. The goal of mapping is to find the correspondence between streamlines across brains, i.e. to find the map of which streamline in one tractogram correspond to which streamline in the other tractogram. We frame the mapping problem as a rectangular linear assignment problem (RLAP), a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization. We adopt a variant of the famous Hungarian method to get the optimal solution of the RLAP. We validate the proposed method with a tract alignment application, where we register two tractograms and, given one anatomical tract, we segment the corresponding one in the other tractogram. On dMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, we provide experimental evidence that mapping, implemented as a RLAP, can vastly improve both the true positive rate and false discovery rate of registration-based alignment, establishing a strong argument in favor of what we propose. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the current approach, which gives perspective for future work.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Nusrat Sharmin"", ids = ""2070024""); list(name = ""Emanuele Olivetti"", ids = ""1759500""); list(name = ""Paolo Avesani"", ids = ""1744234"")",212b2b5c746a3678259a571a4722713728ddcc61; c48a1fdceca89d5c117a24eccf8cdd18e01b419a; 90a2938736cbe81924345c8d52e182b29568a95e; c709dcb5968b33978e80044e308e8917139ba5bf; 1541262407492d03d25fa34b3c6b4b0567cfe4d7,,,,109-120

Eosinophils and neutrophils have the ability to recognize distinct inflammatory phenotypes influencing the clinical characteristics of the disease. Aim: To simultaneously assess the association among tag-SNPs located in 15 inflammation-related genes, EOS, NEU and lung function in adult asthma. Methods: In Verona (Italy), 337 asthmatics (aged 20-64) were identified from the general population in the GEIRD study (2008/2010) and were classified into four inflammation groups: EOS low ( rd quartile = 260 EOS/mm 3 )/NEU low ( rd quartile = 5,050 NEU/mm 3 ), EOS low /NEU high , EOS high /NEU low , EOS high /NEU high . SNPs were selected by testing their univariate association with the inflammation groups and pre-bronchodilator FEV1%pred under the additive genetic model (controlling the false discovery rate). The simultaneous relationships were evaluated by using a mediation model, with current smoking and the use of anti-asthmatic controller medications in the past three months as potential confounders. Results: A SNP in the IL-18 gene region was selected for the mediation analysis. The mediation model is described in this figure:
 Conclusions: This preliminary analysis suggests that a SNP in the IL-18 gene region is associated with the EOS high /NEU high pattern, without a direct association with lung function.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Simone Accordini"", ids = ""4271093""); list(name = ""Lucia Calciano"", ids = ""4843905""); list(name = ""Cristina Bombieri"", ids = ""50980838""); list(name = ""Giovanni Malerba"", ids = ""48489215""); list(name = ""Francesca Belpinati"", ids = ""5714039""); list(name = ""Marcello Ferrari"", ids = ""49453818""); list(name = ""Anna Rita Lo Presti"", ids = ""33916100""); list(name = ""Mario Olivieri"", ids = ""80970242""); list(name = ""Elisabetta Zanolin"", ids = ""4521516""); list(name = ""Roberto de Marco"", ids = ""3503692"")",,,European Respiratory Journal,46,
76a70ed2dc4780b7837ffd7a8716f28f2482bd9f,Ageing is associated with molecular signatures of inflammation and type 2 diabetes in rat pancreatic islets,"Aims/hypothesisAgeing is a major risk factor for development of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Identification of the mechanisms underlying this association could help to elucidate the relationship between age-associated progressive loss of metabolic health and development of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to determine molecular signatures during ageing in the endocrine pancreas.MethodsGlobal gene transcription was measured in pancreatic islets isolated from young and old rats by Ilumina BeadChip arrays. Promoter DNA methylation was measured by Sequenom MassArray in 46 genes that showed differential expression with age, and correlations with expression were established. Alterations in morphological and cellular processes with age were determined by immunohistochemical methods.ResultsAge-related changes in gene expression were found at 623 loci (>1.5-fold, false discovery rate [FDR] <5%), with a significant (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05) enrichment in genes previously implicated in islet-cell function (Enpp1, Abcc8), type 2 diabetes (Tspan8, Kcnq1), inflammatory processes (Cxcl9, Il33) and extracellular matrix organisation (Col3a1, Dpt). Age-associated transcriptional differences negatively correlated with promoter DNA methylation at several loci related to inflammation, glucose homeostasis, cell proliferation and cellâ€“matrix interactions (Il33, Cxcl9, Gpr119, Fbp2, Col3a1, Dpt, Spp1).Conclusions/interpretationOur findings suggest that a significant proportion of pancreatic islets develop a low-grade â€˜chronicâ€™ inflammatory status with ageing and this may trigger altered functional plasticity. Furthermore, we identified changes in expression of genes previously linked to type 2 diabetes and associated changes in DNA methylation that could explain their age-associated dysregulation.

15863017547fc78ba7efb0c630bd4265438f102a,Incorporation of Genetic Pathway Information into Analysis of Multivariate Gene Expression Data,"Abstract: Multivariate microarray gene expression data are commonly collected to study the genomic responses under ordered conditions such as over increasing/decreasing dose levels or over time during biological processes. One important question from such multivariate gene expression experiments is to identify genes that show different expression patterns over treatment dosages or over time and pathways that are perturbed during a given biological process. In this paper, we develop a hidden Markov random field model for multivariate expression data in order to identify genes and subnetworks that are related to biological processes, where the dependency of the differential expression patterns of genes on the networks are modeled by a Markov random field. Simulation studies indicated that the method is quite effective in identifying genes and the modified subnetworks and has higher sensitivity than the commonly used procedures that do not use the pathway information, with similar observed false discovery rates. We applied the proposed methods for analysis of a microarray time course gene expression study of TrkAand TrkB-transfected neuroblastoma cell lines and identified genes and subnetworks on MAPK, focal adhesion and prion disease pathways that may explain cell differentiation in TrkA-transfected cell lines.

Eight purpose-bred intact male hound cross-research dogs were enrolled and randomized to groups based on variables of pressure/body position (n = 4) and insufflation time (n = 4). For each segment of large bowel (rectum, colorectal junction, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon), the adequacy of bowel preparation, % of bowel lumen filled with fecal material, and bowel tortuosity or folding were assessed. Measurements of bowel wall thickness (cm), cross-sectional bowel lumen diameter (cm), and cross-sectional bowel luminal area (cm(2) ) were obtained at standardized locations within the large bowel. False discovery rates (FDR) were calculated to adjust for multiple testing. Values of FDR < 0.05 were considered significant. Differences in mean cross-sectional area and diameter and bowel wall thickness under increasing pressure were not significant after adjusting for multiple testing; some had raw p values <0.05. Ascending colon diameter and ascending colon area significantly increased with insufflation time (FDR < 0.05). No other response variables showed a significant change with insufflation time. The optimal insufflation pressure for maintaining pneumocolon in this study was determined to be 20 mmHg. CTP is a feasible technique to provide consistent distension for imaging of the large bowel and further study on application of CTP in clinical patients is warranted.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Michele A Steffey"", ids = ""4025120""); list(name = ""Leticia Daniel"", ids = ""16814558""); list(name = ""Sandra L.

db8fd3c4d63e46e6faa550b930b35185b8d37eee,Estimating the local false discovery rate via a bootstrap solution to the reference class problem,"Methods of estimating the local false discovery rate (LFDR) have been applied to different types of datasets such as high-throughput biological data, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and genome-wide association (GWA) studies. We present a model for LFDR estimation that incorporates a covariate into each test. Incorporating the covariates may improve the performance of testing procedures, because it contains additional information based on the biological context of the corresponding test. This method provides different estimates depending on a tuning parameter. We estimate the optimal value of that parameter by choosing the one that minimizes the estimated LFDR resulting from the bias and variance in a bootstrap approach. This estimation method is called an adaptive reference class (ARC) method. In this study, we consider the performance of ARC method under certain assumptions on the prior probability of each hypothesis test as a function of the covariate. We prove that, under these assumptions, the ARC method has a mean squared error asymptotically no greater than that of the other method where the entire set of hypotheses is used and assuming a large covariate effect. In addition, we conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of estimator associated with the ARC method for a finite number of hypotheses. Here, we apply the proposed method to coronary artery disease (CAD) data taken from a GWA study and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data.",2018,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Farnoosh Abbas-Aghababazadeh"", ids = ""1405258663""); list(name = ""Mayer Alvo"", ids = ""34746360""); list(name = ""David R.

e884d8447859eb27181757ba9c428ec9a447b6d1,Cortical Thickness Revealing Cerebral Anatomical Deficits in Drug-naive First-episode Schizophrenia,"Purpose: Though many previous studies of gray matter volume provided evidences to support the anatomical deficits mainly involving the cortical thalamo-cortical circuits, the results were quite inconsistent. Furthermore, the gray matter volume of a cortical region represents the combination of cortical thickness and surface area, features which are believed to be influenced by different genetic factors related to sulcal patterning and the thickness of the cortical mantle itself. Cortical thickness reflects the size, density and arrangement of neurons, neuroglia and nerve fibers, and thus its measurement could provide important and relatively unique information about disease-specific neuroanatomical changes. However, few studies had explored the deficits of cortical thickness in schizophrenia. Thus the aim of current study was to explore the difference of cortical thickness between 128drug-naÃ¯ve, first-episode schizophrenia patients and 141 healthy controls. Methods: This study was approved by the local ethical committee and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. 128 antipsychotic-naÃ¯ve, first-episode schizophrenia patients and 141 healthy comparison subjects were recruited in the present research. Both patients and healthy controls were performed MR examination via a 3-Telsa GE MRI system with an 8 channel phase array head coil. We employed CIVET software (version 1.1.9, Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) to extract cortical thickness measurements from T1-weighted MRI images. Vertex-based 2-sample t-test was applied to investigate cortical thickness differences between the patient group and the healthy control group with age and sex as covariance. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05 with false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons. Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were used to assess the neuropsychological functioning and clinical symptoms of schizophrenia patients. Besides, correlation analysis between significant difference of cortical thickness in patient group and scale scores was performed to reveal the potential association between the anatomical deficits and clinical symptoms. Results: Compared to the control group, schizophrenia patients showed significantly cortical thinning in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC), left precentral gyrus, left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), right precentral and postcentral gyri and thickening in bilateral temporal poles, left medial orbitofrontal cortex (med-OFC), left cuneus and right insula (P <0.05)(Figure 1). Meanwhile, the cortical thickness of right DLPFC, bilateral temporal poles, bilateral precentral gyri and left OFC were negatively correlated with the severities of symptoms in patients as identified by PANSS scores for positive symptoms, thought disturbance, activation or depression (Table 1). While positive correlations were found between the cortical thickness of left temporal pole, left cuneus and GAF scores, and between that of right precentral gyrus, left DLPFC and PANSS scores for general psychopathology symptoms as well as depression. Discussion: The current studies in the largest sample of drug-naÃ¯ve, first-episode schizophrenia exhibited significant changes including both thinning and thickening performances of cortical thickness in many cerebral cortices. These obvious alterations of cortices at the very beginning of disease may in some degree facilitate to partly explain the complex neuropathological mechanism of schizophrenia. The cortical thinning, especially, the right DLPFC, may be resulted from neuroprogression characterized by reduced number of neurons or malformation of cortices in schizophrenia. Interestingly, cortical thickening in bilateral temporal poles and other cortices were also revealed and may result from the compensatory mechanism or abnormal neurodevelopment at early stage of schizophrenia. In addition, a strong link between symptoms and cortical thickness displayed a consensus between cerebral structure and clinical manifestations. Conclusion: The significant alteration of cortical thickness at the very beginning of antipsychotic-naÃ¯ve, first-episode patients of schizophrenia provided evidences to support the aberrations in the neurodevelopmental process in schizophrenia. In the further study, longitudinal research about the structural characteristics together with function and clinical symptoms should be performed to investigate the trajectory of disease.",2012,,"list(name = ""Yuan Xiao"", ids = ""143964385""); list(name = ""Su Lui"", ids = ""145965433""); list(name = ""Li Yao"", ids = ""145095579""); list(name = ""Teng Xie"", ids = ""2302747""); list(name = ""Yong He"", ids = ""46968549""); list(name = ""Qiyong Gong"", ids = ""48814194"")",,73c209d934f6835bb705be2645eadc893d24fd34; 35645770572968ff499e8e3a65ad7cabb9748eb7,,,

However, their pathogenic role in osteoarthritis (OA), remains unclear despite the fact that OA SF are activated and affected during the course of the disease. To characterize the dysregulated pathways in both RA and OA several gene expression studies have been conducted mainly using microarrays and by comparing RASF to OASF. However these studies rarely include a healthy control group and do not take into account joint anatomical location. Objectives To measure changes in the expression of microRNA (miR) as well as mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in SF isolated from knees of RA and OA patients compared to healthy individuals. Methods SF were cultured from RA (n=3) and OA (n=3) patients undergoing total knee replacement. Healthy knee SF (n=3) were cultured from biopsies of individuals with arthralgia but no clinical or histological signs of synovitis. Total RNA was extracted after SF were grown for 5â€“7 passages and RNA sequencing was performed with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing system. Changes with a false discovery rate adjusted p-value below 0.05 were considered significantly changed. Functional annotation clustering of mRNAs was done using Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Results We found 31 mRNAs, 6 lncRNA and 3 miR (miR-7â€“5p; miR-181a-3p; miR-378a-3p) upregulated in OASF, but not RASF compared to healthy, and 14 mRNA, 3 lncRNA and 5 miR (miR-3118; miR-514a-3p; miR-585â€“5p; miR-615â€“3p; miR-615â€“5p) were downregulated in knee OASF specifically.15 mRNA, 11 lncRNA and 3 miR (miR-143â€“3p; miR-145â€“3p; miR-493â€“3p) were upregulated in knee RASF, but not OASF compared to healthy. In this RA group 7 mRNA, 4 lncRNA and 4 miR (miR-124â€“5p; miR-204â€“5p; miR-3065â€“5p; miR-4657) were specifically downregulated. 29 mRNA, 6 lncRNA and 8 miR were upregulated in RA as well as OASF and 9 mRNA, 2 lncRNA and 7 miR were downregulated. Pathway analysis in mRNAs that were upregulated specifically in OA included cell adhesion pathways mainly based on the regulation of protocadherins (PCDH1; PCDHAC2). Pathways that were restricted to RA were extracellular matrix related genes such as Fraser Extracellular Matrix Complex Subunit 1 (FRAS1). The Wnt signaling pathway was regulated in both diseases, e.g. by upregulation of R-Sponding 3 (RSPO3) which has previously found to be upregulated in RASF compared to healthy SF. Conclusions Using a next generation sequencing approach we have identified pathways and non-coding transcripts that are specifically dysregulated in OASF or RASF in the knees. These data corroborate and further elucidate the role of synovial fibroblasts in RA pathogenesis. Furthermore this study clearly demonstrates the involvement of SF in the pathogenesis of OA and identifies differences in the pathways activated in knee OA and knee RA, respectively.

There is evidence vitamin A plays a role in neuroblastoma. Not only is 13-cis-retinoic acid used as maintenance therapy for high-risk cases, but prenatal vitamin intake use may decrease neuroblastoma risk. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in vitamin A-related genes are may be associated with neuroblastoma risk and potentially be modified by vitamin A intake.


METHODS
The Neuroblastoma Epidemiology in North America (NENA) study recruited 563 case-parent sets through the Children's Oncology Group's Childhood Cancer Research Network. We ascertained dietary nutrient intake through questionnaires and genotyped 463 SNPs in vitamin A-related genes from saliva DNA. Offspring and maternal log-additive risk ratios (RR) and stratum-specific RR for gene-environment interaction were estimated with a log-linear model. We avoided false positives due to multiple testing by using the false discovery rate (FDR).


RESULTS
When all neuroblastoma cases were considered together, no offspring variants met the significance criteria (FDR Q-valueâ€¯<â€¯0.2). One maternal SNP (rs12442054) was associated with decreased risk of neuroblastoma (RR: 0.61; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.47-0.79, Qâ€¯=â€¯0.076). When the cases were categorized according to prognostic risk category and age at onset, nine offspring SNPs were significantly associated with intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. Maternal rs6776706 was associated with (RR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.33-0.72, Qâ€¯=â€¯0.161) high-risk neuroblastoma and maternal rs11103603 (RR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.45-0.79, Qâ€¯=â€¯0.127) was associated with neuroblastoma aged <1â€¯year. For gene-environment interaction, maternal rs729147 was associated with decreased risk of neuroblastoma among mothers with vitamin A consumption above the recommendation.


CONCLUSIONS
Although there is biologic plausibility for the role of vitamin A in neuroblastoma, we found weak evidence of a relationship between vitamin A related genes and neuroblastoma.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Angela L Mazul"", ids = ""8634971""); list(name = ""Clarice R.

f2296278010a12a1c0e80d5e48f68e7a75ea8178,Male fertility status is associated with DNA methylation signatures in sperm and transcriptomic profiles of bovine preimplantation embryos,"BackgroundInfertility in dairy cattle is a concern where reduced fertilization rates and high embryonic loss are contributing factors. Studies of the paternal contribution to reproductive performance are limited. However, recent discoveries have shown that, in addition to DNA, sperm delivers transcription factors and epigenetic components that are required for fertilization and proper embryonic development. Hence, characterization of the paternal contribution at the time of fertilization is warranted. We hypothesized that sire fertility is associated with differences in DNA methylation patterns in sperm and that the embryonic transcriptomic profiles are influenced by the fertility status of the bull. Embryos were generated in vitro by fertilization with either a high or low fertility Holstein bull. Blastocysts derived from each high and low fertility bulls were evaluated for morphology, development, and transcriptomic analysis using RNA-Sequencing. Additionally, DNA methylation signatures of sperm from high and low fertility sires were characterized by performing whole-genome DNA methylation binding domain sequencing.ResultsEmbryo morphology and developmental capacity did not differ between embryos generated from either a high or low fertility bull. However, RNA-Sequencing revealed 98 genes to be differentially expressed at a false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰1%. A total of 65 genes were upregulated in high fertility bull derived embryos, and 33 genes were upregulated in low fertility derived embryos. Expression of the genes CYCS, EEA1, SLC16A7, MEPCE, and TFB2M was validated in three new pairs of biological replicates of embryos. The role of the differentially expressed gene TFB2M in embryonic development was further assessed through expression knockdown at the zygotic stage, which resulted in decreased development to the blastocyst stage. Assessment of the epigenetic signature of spermatozoa between high and low fertility bulls revealed 76 differentially methylated regions.ConclusionsDespite similar morphology and development to the blastocyst stage, preimplantation embryos derived from high and low fertility bulls displayed significant transcriptomic differences.

8be91a59628e8a01999bb3c5e0b255ca5c0553ec,Generalized Goodness-Of-Fit Tests for Correlated Data,"This paper concerns the problem of applying the generalized goodness-of-fit (gGOF) type tests for analyzing correlated data. The gGOF family broadly covers the maximum-based testing procedures by ordered input $p$-values, such as the false discovery rate procedure, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov type statistics, the $\phi$-divergence family, etc. Data analysis framework and a novel $p$-value calculation approach is developed under the Gaussian mean model and the generalized linear model (GLM). We reveal the influence of data transformations to the signal-to-noise ratio and the statistical power under both sparse and dense signal patterns and various correlation structures. In particular, the innovated transformation (IT), which is shown equivalent to the marginal model-fitting under the GLM, is often preferred for detecting sparse signals in correlated data. We propose a testing strategy called the digGOF, which combines a double-adaptation procedure (i.e., adapting to both the statistic's formula and the truncation scheme of the input $p$-values) and the IT within the gGOF family. It features efficient computation and robust adaptation to the family-retained advantages for given data. Relevant approaches are assessed by extensive simulations and by genetic studies of Crohn's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

542db0bac17e7f10007e01f847ff71c84ff027aa,Prediction of cancer using customised fuzzy rough machine learning approaches,"This Letter proposes a customised approach for attribute selection applied to the fuzzy rough quick reduct algorithm. The unbalanced data is balanced using synthetic minority oversampling technique. The huge dimensionality of the cancer data is reduced using a correlation-based filter. The dimensionality reduced balanced attribute gene subset is used to compute the final minimal reduct set using a customised fuzzy triangular norm operator on the fuzzy rough quick reduct algorithm. The customised fuzzy triangular norm operator is used with a Lukasiewicz fuzzy implicator to compute the fuzzy approximation. The customised operator selects the least number of informative feature genes from the dimensionality reduced datasets. Classification accuracy using leave-one-out cross validation of 94.85, 76.54, 98.11, and 99.13% is obtained using a customised function for Lukasiewicz triangular norm operator on leukemia, central nervous system, lung, and ovarian datasets, respectively. Performance analysis of the conventional fuzzy rough quick reduct and the proposed method are performed using parameters such as classification accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, scatter plots, receiver operating characteristic area, McNemar test, chi-squared test, Matthew's correlation coefficient and false discovery rate that are used to prove that the proposed approach performs better than available methods in the literature.",2019,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chinnaswamy Arunkumar"", ids = ""46989787""); list(name = ""Srinivasan Ramakrishnan"", ids = ""2970715"")",,895df82cd57e8229b2aca0630dfe0e12174fee0d; 4a5e0ac01c4a9773feec360d4a9ed1cb6bce2b65; 7306845e55e2c9aff19ebeb3495efc845a01d9b7; 372da821584fb92a73b2760b75da579d2f4703f3; c7210cce1c20420f46c27188cd699456980abee5; 13da072ed5a5d083c23c1cd461d0ed2cfc0ab48c; b2ce2893661e7070512643d0673ae3aeafdda239; a127e1a187c671992950993d0ed20d1cec8eb307; 65ae0242a9572ed97dce56d65ef48eeee5b34209; ede0bafcc7f638339e9eda34b298d756238bd0db; fcb1665f55ed99d87a7ff6e33e0f4a53c24d7251; 22ff9f0afc29374c451053a5197f379664691ade; 5bd86347ff2920fbc4be57d2611ac36c1d99e341; 49901242f9421890ec70b67324e4bf1dd9c8f9c9; 0b8d479b9de9b416fde7a8de6dabb1d56b73ce08; 69e1e2c466b84727f2f09d9b0e03be49df2857b1; a48152ef97c93cd72d3933bd4a9b984df24debfd; 8cb44f06586f609a29d9b496cc752ec01475dffe; cfed350eee1b90f807156f5037a82d7d6a11be94; 58de885d8ec4f211ee1bad4ba5bda0358fe0e739; e296a655ca64d8019edde8ade38db08c7041dd8e; 0ace477b686e1a1d5488666ddbc468291b8efdf1,Healthcare Technology Letters,6,13 - 18
f850614de09c084b9f71206500218ac3b1c2d0df,Detecting signals in FMRI data using powerful FDR procedures,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) has revolutionized the study of linking physical stimuli with localized brain activity. Among the challenges of working with FMRI data, they are noisy, they exhibit spatial correlation, and they are usually large containing tens of thousands of voxels of information. The notion of False Discovery Rate (FDR) has made a great impact on how to perform powerful multiple hypothesis tests to detect signals in such large multivariate data. The spatial dependence in FMRI data requires special care since, if ignored, it can lead to a loss of control of size as well as a deterioration in power of FDR procedures. This article advocates transforming the voxelwise test statistics to wavelet space, where the coefficients are approximately uncorrelated. We demonstrate, through a series of experiments, that an FDR procedure in wavelet space enhanced by P -value adaptive thresholding (EPAT), maintains control of the size of the multiple-testing procedure and offers substantially increased power over an FDR procedure that is applied directly to the map of (spatially dependent) test statistics.

38a082ced5189ebc5baf0f1c8859321bb26991d2,A Bandit Approach to Classification and False-Discovery Control,"In many scientific settings there is a need for adaptive experimental design to guide the process of identifying regions of the search space that contain as many true positives as possible subject to a low rate of false discoveries (i.e. false alarms). Such regions of the search space could differ drastically from a predicted set that minimizes 0/1 error and moreover accurate identification could require very different sampling strategies. Like active learning for binary classification, this experimental design can not be optimally chosen a priori, but rather the data must be taken sequentially and adaptively in a closed loop. However, unlike active classification, finding a set with high true positive rate and low false discovery rate (FDR) is not as well understood. In this paper we provide the first provably sample efficient adaptive algorithm for this problem. Along the way we highlight connections between classification, combinatorial bandits, and FDR control making contributions to each.",2019,,"list(name = ""Lalit Jain"", ids = ""34939951""); list(name = ""Kevin G.

Methods According to the data of the first 5,000 SNPs in chromosome 22 of Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry from the CEPH collection released in HapMap III in February 2009,case-control data were simulated by HAPGEN2,and Tag SNPs were screened by Haploview4.2.The correct rates of different simulation conditions in screening pathogenic SNPs were compared. Results The methods of obtaining the relative risk(RR) were not significantly different.Three genetic models all showed that the correct rate increased with the rising RR.For the same RR,the additive model had the highest correct rate,the dominant model had the second,and the recessive model had the lowest.For the additive model with RR2.2,the dominant model with RR4 and the recessive model with RR5,the correct rate was over 60%. Conclusions Combination of Ï‡2 test with FDR has the best application in the additive model.In the actual scientific research,the feasibility of Ï‡2 test combined with FDR should be considered on the basis of the concrete conditions of the target disease.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Sun Yuan-jie"", ids = ""89609658"")",,,Practical Preventive Medicine,,
1866e9b08ff6972c9a848f7e924354d00f43aebc,Identification of diagnostic markers in colorectal cancer via integrative epigenomics and genomics data,"Apart from genetic mutations, epigenetic alteration is a common phenomenon that contributes to neoplastic transformation in colorectal cancer. Transcriptional silencing of tumor-suppressor genes without changes in the DNA sequence is explained by the existence of promoter hypermethylation. To test this hypothesis, we integrated the epigenome and transcriptome data from a similar set of colorectal tissue samples. Methylation profiling was performed using the Illumina InfiniumHumanMethylation27 BeadChip on 55 paired cancer and adjacent normal epithelial cells. Fifteen of the 55 paired tissues were used for gene expression profiling using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST array. Validation was carried out on 150 colorectal tissues using the methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) technique. PCA and supervised hierarchical clustering in the two microarray datasets showed good separation between cancer and normal samples. Significant genes from the two analyses were obtained based on a â‰¥2-fold change and a false discovery rate (FDR) p-value of <0.05. We identified 1,081 differentially hypermethylated CpG sites and 36 hypomethylated CpG sites. We also found 709 upregulated and 699 downregulated genes from the gene expression profiling. A comparison of the two datasets revealed 32 overlapping genes with 27 being hypermethylated with downregulated expression and 4 hypermethylated with upregulated expression. One gene was found to be hypomethylated and downregulated. The most enriched molecular pathway identified was cell adhesion molecules that involved 4 overlapped genes, JAM2, NCAM1, ITGA8 and CNTN1. In the present study, we successfully identified a group of genes that showed methylation and gene expression changes in well-defined colorectal cancer tissues with high purity.

f0ca9baacb288a3c2cb3fb4a031900bb5a8d8e04,166 Mitochondrial stress responses in bovine cumulus cells and oocytes matured under lipotoxic conditions: a proteomic insight,"Obesity and up-regulated lipolysis are commonly associated with increased free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations, predominantly palmitic acid (PA), in blood and ovarian follicular fluid, which have been strongly linked with reduced oocyte quality. Mitochondria are known to play a central role in regulating cellular stress responses to lipotoxicity, which is well described in somatic cells. Although mitochondrial functions in oocytes are crucial for developmental competence, their stress response capacity has not been clearly described. Networking with endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein responses (UPR) and protein translation may be different in oocytes than in somatic cells. Understanding these mechanisms is important to develop treatments. The aim of this study was to compare PA-induced stress responses in oocytes to those in cumulus cells (CC). We exposed bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) to pathophysiological PA concentration (150 ÂµM) or solvent during in vitro maturation (24â€‰h) as a model. Then, the CC were separated from the oocytes (from pools of 120 COC per treatment per replicate, 3 replicates), and their proteomic profiles were examined using shotgun proteomic analysis with tandem mass tags. Functional analysis of the differentially regulated proteins (DRP; Pâ€‰ 10%, false discovery rate <5%) was done using IngenuityÂ® Pathway Analysis (IPAÂ®; Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). A total of 1843 and 1275 proteins were identified in CC and oocytes, respectively, of which 86 and 54 were differentially regulated by PA. In CC, 20/86 proteins were mitochondrial, 16 of which were down-regulated. Canonical pathway analysis in CC showed that pro-apoptotic UPR, mitochondrial dysfunction, and other related redox regulatory, metabolic, and apoptotic pathways were the most affected. In the enclosed oocytes, 12/54 proteins were mitochondrial, 8 of which were up-regulated. Functional analysis of the DRP in oocytes suggests that pro-survival mechanisms were predominant. Mitochondrion-specific H2O2-scavenging enzyme (peroxiredoxin-3), mitochondrial trifunctional protein (HADHB), heat shock protein A8 (HSPA8), as well as the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, among others, were key regulatory mechanisms induced by PA in the oocytes. However, an increase in the relative abundance of cytochrome C was evident, which may trigger apoptosis. This was accompanied by up-regulation of SLC24A5, which negatively regulates mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and may prevent such apoptotic trigger. These data show that the mitochondria in oocytes, despite being structurally immature, regulate adaptive signalling pathways in response to metabolic stress. Although the proteomic changes in oocytes were predominantly anti-apoptotic, certain defective pro-apoptotic changes were identified. These data provide a unique insight into the mitochondrial adaptive signalling pathways in metabolically compromised oocytes, and indicate specific mitochondrial target pathways through which the developmental capacity of metabolically compromised oocytes can be improved or protected.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Waleed F A Marei"", ids = ""10246479""); list(name = ""Geert Van Raemdonck"", ids = ""88771165""); list(name = ""Geert Baggerman"", ids = ""4726291""); list(name = ""Peter E.

0ff979d0d442fcfd62db64d524a53457b3b01cdc,RNA immunoprecipitation identifies novel targets of DAZL in human foetal ovary,"Study question
Can novel meiotic RNA targets ofÂ DAZL (deleted in azoospermia-like) be identified in the human foetal ovary?


Summary answer
SYCP1 (synaptonemal complex protein-1), TEX11 (testis expressed 11) and SMC1B (structural maintenance of chromosomes 1B) are novel DAZL targets in the human foetal ovary, thus DAZL may have previously unrecognised roles in the translational regulation of RNAs involved in chromosome cohesion and DNA recombination in the oocyte from the time of initiation of meiosis.


What is known already
The phenotype of Dazl deficiency in mouse is infertility in both sexes and DAZL has also been linked to infertility in humans. Few studies have explored targets of this RNA-binding protein. The majority of these investigations have been carried out in mouse, and have focussed on the male thus the basis for its central function in regulating female fertility is largely unknown.

We carried out RNA sequencing after immunoprecipitation of endogenous DAZL from human foetal ovarian tissue (17 weeks of gestation, obtained after elective termination of pregnancy) to identify novel DAZL targets involved in meiosis (n = 3 biological replicates).


Participants/materials, setting, methods
Using quantitative RT-PCR, we examined the expression of selected RNAs identified by our immunoprecipitation across gestation, and visualised the expression of potential target SMC1B in relation to DAZL, with a combination of in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. 3' untranslated region (3'UTR)-luciferase reporter assays and polysome profile analysis were used to investigate the regulation of three RNA targets by DAZL, representing key functionalities: SYCP1, TEX11 and SMC1B.


Main results and the role of chance
We identified 764 potential RNA targets of DAZL in the human foetal ovary (false discovery rate 0.05 and log-fold change â‰¥ 2), with functions in synaptonemal complex formation (SYCP1, SYCP3), cohesin formation (SMC1B, RAD21), spindle assembly checkpoint (MAD2L1, TRIP13) and recombination and DNA repair (HORMAD1, TRIP13, TEX11, RAD18, RAD51). We demonstrated that the translation of novel targets SYCP1 (P = 0.004), TEX11 (P = 0.004) and SMC1B (P = 0.002) is stimulated by the presence of DAZL but not by a mutant DAZL with impaired RNA-binding activity.


Large scale data
The raw data are available at GEO using the study ID: GSE81524.


Limitations, reasons for caution
This analysis is based on identification of DAZL targets at the time when meiosis starts in the ovary: it may have other targets at other stages of oocyte development, and in the testis. Representative targets were validated, but detailed analysis was not performed on the majority of putative targets.


Wider implications of the findings
These data indicate roles for DAZL in the regulation of several key functions in human oocytes. Through the translational regulation of novel RNA targets SMC1B and TEX11, DAZL may have a key role in regulating chromosome cohesion and DNA recombination; two processes fundamental in determining oocyte quality and whose establishment in foetal life may support lifelong fertility.

e47c8135dd2c62ed80186afd1a23f1467cc5644a,A genetic association study of maternal and fetal candidate genes that predispose to preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM).,"OBJECTIVE
We sought to determine whether maternal/fetal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes are associated with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (pPROM).


STUDY DESIGN
A case-control study was conducted in patients with pPROM (225 mothers and 155 fetuses) and 599 mothers and 628 fetuses with a normal pregnancy; 190 candidate genes and 775 SNPs were studied. Single locus/haplotype association analyses were performed; false discovery rate was used to correct for multiple testing (q* = 0.15).


RESULTS
First, a SNP in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 in mothers was significantly associated with pPROM (odds ratio, 2.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.47-3.07; P = .000068), and this association remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Second, haplotypes for Alpha 3 type IV collagen isoform precursor in the mother were associated with pPROM (global P = .003). Third, multilocus analysis identified a 3-locus model, which included maternal SNPs in collagen type I alpha 2, defensin alpha 5 gene, and endothelin 1.

DNA variants in a maternal gene involved in extracellular matrix metabolism doubled the risk of pPROM.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Roberto Romero"", ids = ""145783429""); list(name = ""Lara A.

b179d2e4e8a08a1d0584e5eb203108ec63c11b2c,A genome-wide scan maps a novel high myopia locus to 5p15.,"PURPOSE
This study was conducted to investigate the genetic component of three Chinese pedigrees originating from Hong Kong with autosomal dominant high myopia.


METHODS
A whole-genome scan was performed by using microsatellite markers spanning the whole genome with an average spacing of 10 cM. Regions containing markers that yielded LOD scores >1.0 were further analyzed by fine mapping with additional microsatellite markers. Fine-scale mapping of the linkage region was performed by genotyping a set of gene-based SNP markers on a cohort of 94 high myopia cases and 94 control subjects.


RESULTS
Two-point LOD scores >1 were observed at markers D5S630, D5S416, D7S510, D11S908, and D17S944. Additional microsatellite markers flanking D5S630 revealed a maximum two-point LOD score of 4.81 at D5S2505 at theta = 0.00. Haplotype analysis narrowed the linkage region to 5p15.33-p15.2 with a 17.45-cM interval. The coding sequences of five genes located within this region, IRX2, IRX1, POLS, CCT5, and CTNND2, were screened. No segregation of polymorphism with high myopia was found. Genotyping of 41 SNPs within this region in a Chinese cohort of 94 high myopia cases and 94 control subjects showed that the allele and genotype distributions of one SNP, rs370010, was different between cases and controls (genotype P = 0.01176, allele P = 0.00271 and trend P = 0.00375), but such association did not remain significant after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. This SNP is located within a hypothetical gene LOC442129.


CONCLUSIONS

3a4d95ae8ce4cf41e5222335e40858ec66b83b4d,Abstract 3286: Overexpression of cornulin in histologically normal adjacent tissue predicts occult nodal metastases in head and neck cancer patients,"Proceedings: AACR 101st Annual Meeting 2010â€â€ Apr 17â€21, 2010; Washington, DC

As with many epithelial cancers, presence of nodal metastases in patients with Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) predicts early recurrence and poor survival. Determination of occult metastases in the clinically N-zero (cN0) patient remains problematic and therefore prophylactic neck dissections are routinely performed for high risk cN0 patients. A cohort of 7 cN0 HNSCC patients who subsequently underwent planned neck dissection as part of their treatment was selected. Snap frozen tissue was enriched for tumor and adjacent normal tissue by laser capture microdissection. Total protein was extracted and separated by saturation-labeling 2D difference in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Significance analysis of Microarray (SAM) method was used to evaluate for differential protein expression between patients with (n=3) and without (n=4) occult nodal metastases on neck dissection pathologic evaluation. Spot maps were generated for 14 gels (7 HNSCC, 7 normal) and relative abundance values calculated for each of 662 protein spots common to >90% of gels. A 5% false discovery rate and 2-fold change were used as criteria for significance in the defintion of candidate biomarkers. Protein spots meeting these criteria were then extracted, digested and analyzed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to obtain protein identifications. For tumor tissue, there was no significant difference between groups. There were considerable differences in protein expression for normal adjacent tissue between patients with and without occult metastases, with 60 spots meeting criteria for significance (FDR<0.05). There were 31 proteins underexpressed in occult metastases patients, with the top candidate being 11.9 fold lower in the occult metastasis group (adjusted q<0.001). There were 29 proteins overexpressed, with the top candidate being 6.6 fold higher in the occult metastasis group (adjusted q<0.001). This protein was identified as Cornulin, a 53 kDa calcium-binding protein of the s100 family recently identified as a novel HNSCC biomarker. Cornulin plays a known role as a cornification chaperone that is protective against acid stress in squamous epithelium. It is possible that elevated cornulin in surrounding normal tissue may reflect ongoing epithelial injury, predisposing developing tumors to aggressive behavior. In conclusion, we have identified overexpression of cornulin in adjacent normal tissue as a novel biomarker for tumors with occult metastases in the cN0 HNSCC patient population. Additionally, these data highlight the role that tumor-stroma interactions may play in the development of early nodal metastases.

19196fda44a9a4fa4885976c510448e8c0629982,EBF1 Gene mRNA Levels in Maternal Blood and Spontaneous Preterm Birth,"Genetic variants of six genes (EBF1, EEFSEC, AGTR2, WNT4, ADCY5, and RAP2C) have been linked recently to gestational duration and/or spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB). Our goal was to examine sPTB in relation to maternal blood mRNA levels of these genes. We used a public gene expression dataset (GSE59491) derived from maternal blood in trimesters 2 and 3 that included women with sPTB (nâ€‰=â€‰51) and term births (nâ€‰=â€‰106) matched for maternal age, race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy body mass index, smoking during pregnancy, and parity. T tests were used to examine mRNA mean differences (sPTB vs term) within and across trimesters, and logistic regression models with mRNA quartiles were applied to assess associations between candidate gene mRNA levels and sPTB. Based on these analyses, one significant candidate gene was used in a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify related gene sets. These gene sets were then compared with the ones previously linked to sPTB in the same samples. Our results indicated that among women in the lowest quartile of EBF1 mRNA in the 2nd or 3rd trimester, the odds ratio for sPTB was 2.86 (95%CI 1.08, 7.58) (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0349, false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰=â€‰0.18) and 4.43 (95%CI 1.57, 12.50) (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0049, FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.06), respectively. No other candidate gene mRNAs were significantly associated with sPTB. In GSEA, 24 downregulated gene sets were correlated with 2nd trimester low EBF1 mRNA and part of previous sPTB-associated gene sets. In conclusion, mRNA levels of EBF1 in maternal blood may be useful in detecting increased risk of sPTB as early as 2nd trimester.

6df985856ff643c5b7a5827f525d0179cc388b4f,Global Transcriptome Analysis During Adipogenic Differentiation and Involvement of Transthyretin Gene in Adipogenesis in Cattle,"Adipose tissue plays central role in determining the gustatory quality of beef, but traditional Chinese beef cattle have low levels of fat content. We applied RNA-seq to study the molecular mechanisms underlying adipocyte differentiation in Qinchuan cattle. A total of 18,283 genes were found to be expressed in preadipocytes and mature adipocytes, respectively. 470 of which were significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) [false discovery rate (FDR) values < 0.05 and fold change â‰¥ 2]. In addition, 4534 alternative splicing (AS) events and 5153 AS events were detected in preadipocytes and adipocytes, respectively. We constructed a protein interaction network, which suggested that collagen plays an important role during bovine adipogenic differentiation. We characterized the function of the most down-regulated DEG (P < 0.001) among genes we have detected by qPCR, namely, the transthyretin (TTR) gene. Overexpression of TTR appears to promote the expression of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor Î³ (PPARÎ³) (P < 0.05) and fatty acid binding Protein 4 (FABP4) (P < 0.05). Hence, TTR appears to be involved in the regulation of bovine adipogenic differentiation. Our study represents the comprehensive approach to explore bovine adipocyte differentiation using transcriptomic data and reports an involvement of TTR during bovine adipogenic differentiation.

039da6684db2b15dad00eb21d3c1abf0361c8c57,Abstract 4733: Gene-set analysis of colon cancer genome-wide association data: Identification of the TGF-beta pathway,"First results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have demonstrated considerable success in identifying genetic variants associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). To date, 10 CRC susceptibility loci have been identified. However, these marginal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations explain only âˆ¼6% of the heritable variation underlying CRC risk. We employed a pathway-based approach using our recently developed Gene-set Ridge Regression in Association Studies (GRASS) method to assess whether sets of functionally related genes are enriched for SNPs associated with colon cancer risk. We used GWAS data from three studies: The Women9s Health Initiative (WHI; 483 cases and 530 controls); the Prostate, Lung, Colon and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO; 546 cases and 1177 controls); and the Diet, Activity and Lifestyle population-based case-control study (DALS; 698 cases and 719 controls). Samples were genotyped on Illumina HumanHap 300K + 240K, 550K or 610K platforms. After applying stringent quality control criteria, our final analysis included 392,361 SNPs. We used genomic partition to assign SNPs to nearby genes and defined pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. We restricted our analysis to 170 pathways with 10 or more genes (range 10-253 genes). Our GRASS method uses eigenSNPs derived from principal components analysis within each gene. Regularized regression is performed for each pathway, using a novel group ridge penalty function. The penalty function results in selection of the most representative eigenSNPs within genes while assessing the association of all the genes, within a pathway, with disease risk. Permutations are used to standardize the test statistics and obtain p-values. The false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. We analyzed WHI, PLCO and DALS separately, adjusting for age, sex, and genetic ancestry derived from principal components analysis, and performed a meta-analysis to combine the results. Five pathways were significant at a p-value cutoff of 0.05. The top pathway, the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway (p-value=0.009), also met a FDR cutoff of 20%. This pathway remained significant (p=0.014) after excluding the known CRC susceptibility loci and all SNPs with linkage disequilibrium r2>0.2 with those 10 loci. The top genes in the pathway were TFGB1, SMAD4, FST, TFGB2, INHBA, PITX2, BMPR2 and PP2R2B (all p Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

To identify genetic markers that might be used to predict risk for these injuries, we performed genome-wide association screens for these injuries using data from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort consisting of 102,979 individuals. We did not find any single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with either of these injuries with a p-value that was genome-wide significant (p<5x10-8). We found, however, four and three polymorphisms with p-values that were borderline significant (p<10-6) for Achilles tendon injury and ACL rupture, respectively. We then tested SNPs previously reported to be associated with either Achilles tendon injury or ACL rupture. None showed an association in our cohort with a false discovery rate of less than 5%. We obtained, however, moderate to weak evidence for replication in one case; specifically, rs4919510 in MIR608 had a p-value of 5.1x10-3 for association with Achilles tendon injury, corresponding to a 7% chance of false replication. Finally, we tested 2855 SNPs in 90 candidate genes for musculoskeletal injury, but did not find any that showed a significant association below a false discovery rate of 5%. We provide data containing summary statistics for the entire genome, which will be useful for future genetic studies on these injuries.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Stuart K.

Fold change is the simplest method for identifying differentially expressed genes (De Risi et al. (1997 ), Eisen et al., (1998)). Literature on traditional clustering and discrimination methods in gene expression analysis include works by Eisen et al., (1998) , Golub et al. (1999), Spellman et al., (1998), Tamayo et al., (1999),Tibshirani et al., (1999) and Brown and Botstein (1999). Most of the methods use various types of clustering algorithms such as K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering and self organizing maps to discriminate and characterize patterns of gene expression.

Objective We sought to determine whether IgE and IgG4 antibody binding to allergenic milk protein epitopes changes with MOIT and whether this could predict the development of SU. Methods By using a novel highâ€throughput Luminexâ€based assay to quantitate IgE and IgG4 antibody binding to 66 sequential epitopes on 5 milk proteins, serum samples from 47 subjects were evaluated before and after MOIT. Machine learning strategies were used to predict whether a subject would have SU after 8 weeks of MOIT discontinuation. Results MOIT profoundly altered IgE and IgG4 binding to epitopes, regardless of treatment outcome. At the initiation of MOIT, subjects achieving SU exhibited significantly less antibody binding to 40 allergenic epitopes than subjects who were desensitized only (false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05 and fold change > 1.5). Based on baseline epitopeâ€specific antibody binding, we developed predictive models of SU. Using simulations, we show that, on average, IgEâ€binding epitopes alone perform significantly better than models using standard serum component proteins (average area under the curve, >97% vs 80%). The optimum model using 6 IgEâ€binding epitopes achieved a 95% area under the curve and 87% accuracy. Conclusion Despite the relatively small sample size, we have shown that by measuring the epitope repertoire, we can build reliable models to predict the probability of SU after MOIT. Baseline epitope profiles appear more predictive of MOIT response than those based on serum component proteins. Graphical abstract Figure.

73fbe8be66d343817fbb3fe7dadf85af5de4f916,Strong correlation between ASPM gene expression and HCV cirrhosis progression identified by co-expression analysis.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis is at a high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and its progression is influenced by a complex network of gene interactions. A weighted gene co-expression network was constructed to identify gene modules associated with the seven-stage disease progression from HCV cirrhosis to HCV-related HCC (n=65). In the significant module (R2=0.86), a total of 25 network hub genes were identified, half of which were also hub nodes in the protein-protein interaction network of the module genes. In validation, most hub genes showed a moderate correlation with the disease progression, and only ASPM was highly correlated (R2=0.801). In the test set (n=63), ASPM was also more highly expressed in HCV cirrhosis with concomitant HCC than in those without HCC (P=0.0054). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that the gene set of ""regulation of protein amino acid phosphorylation"" (n=20) was enriched in HCV cirrhosis samples with ASPM highly expressed (false discovery rate (FDR)=0.049). In gene ontology (GO) analysis, genes in the enriched set were associated with liver neoplasms and other neoplastic diseases. In conclusion, through co-expression analysis, ASPM was identified and validated in association with the progression of HCV cirrhosis probably by regulating tumor-related phosphorylation.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Fan Wang"", ids = ""49451020""); list(name = ""Ying Chang"", ids = ""153490698""); list(name = ""Jin Ling Li"", ids = ""92861774""); list(name = ""Hongling Wang"", ids = ""144731157""); list(name = ""Rui Zhou"", ids = ""38421883""); list(name = ""Jian Qi"", ids = ""81832139""); list(name = ""Jing Liu"", ids = ""8652942""); list(name = ""Qun Zhao"", ids = ""144089821"")",797b5dfb48fd9e2574624e7d7f33afa07bcdcd7e; 4fcdad56808979c4125482487dd7117749cb3a69; be502455eac26fa83a6cea8f775a5ba2ecb806ae; 674066b2fc413091858090d6851010866b776bf2; 9f521562ddab794647bab55b115aecd7ec0be4e8; f1d2b49e6ab52549746e15b9d18329a392bfb13c; 7ca6ed8bdf0fa1d49ea6efc42774875f591f2e60; 829197fde522a9df5730f3b80a0bf5a751b82404; b25299a183b9782a9d6c842b6674d32fcdb7679e; 88975159b610b6192a731cfdffe8c00860f60e12; 663a8bd06c8167068f0f4396e04b5371fd653167; a4e67b7d42526493aa0aa3f876afac454bb6d4f6,685cc1ce956b12171309bccd2894b9a348dcc997; d196e94583255b1de2e1337de40f9fe00e41c5c4; acd2396d69d570db5edc070109b77ef9acd06792; 2e43538a0dd32b9f84a3d0a6b3f363f035fad73b; afafcf84a059a9e5cc036fdafb5022d6ee19f575; c71d738adf3b7c3e12a5cee33d05059921486ca1; 6c973bd3d35c052bc051e1c9ea0ab60697a5fb3f; 69025503908fae4aa2f79b74e9930f97d0608eee; f45eb742a71570bb5788cbde61a3e1db643b636f; 7c75c794aae15e84fb387e1425cdfab000cd5d59; 8fc947552804b084d889f2d38ac93e95c7cf8a4d; b7695732b89cfb43f322de0fdc1c23c8c68a83cb; 392951e73fe0070621c1564ecf8a0a98f42ca029; e6a513d4a66c4b5cd950fad0f68e366eaad8b353; 92dc30fc4b3138fe692a969c9d59a33e0b4ca272; c84f251d9b5149ce92eb3389cdc9e98689e543ca; 43c740f18f10167cf7971cbc6ca9275a4cfbf2ec; 7813a8f56ca073ed9f3abc4e34cb0e11944a32b7; 0f7b8cea30108c4a97e3e980ed45e4d9b221d8aa; b8e2ebaae0159893ab676331c11e18b3ed220f1a; b379809916014cbb0acdfe9337990a80b3bfccac; 4ce01c592884f9a0573073b52b130064002dec6e; ad15109dc69a93a1f899812401ec7546048f1166; d7ee37c34ba46b5432d93f555b92f820e6ea4d27; 43b1be0743fac1d9a977450825f3448b09828534; 187848e942345e403c4cf8517260df2bf05c8b87,Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,49 1,"

8eabe07351f8e2f61fc3fe92e878e814b02afeb5,A nonparametric method to assess significance of events in search for gravitational waves with false discovery rate,"In this paper, we present a consistent procedure to assess the significance of gravitational wave events observed by laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors based on the background distribution of detection statistic. Based on the estimated p-values, we propose a procedure to assess the significance of a particular event with the false discovery rate. The false discovery rate can distinguish gravitational wave events from noise events and can provide reliable alerts to electromagnetic telescopes for follow-up observations. The proposed procedure is demonstrated by reanalyzing the results of the analysis of the first observing run (O1) data of advanced LIGO. As a result, we find that GW150914, GW151226, and GW151012 should be called significant, if the events whose false discovery rate is smaller than 0.05 are called significant. The result is consistent with the recent catalog of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences. In addition, it is shown that the procedure presented in this paper is more powerful than the method controlling the Pastro, which is a conventional measure of the false discovery rate. The proposed procedure is applicable to other searches for gravitational waves whose background distribution of detection statistic is difficult to know.",2019,Physics,"list(name = ""Hirotaka Yuzurihara"", ids = ""102399397""); list(name = ""Shuhei Mano"", ids = ""49722190""); list(name = ""Hideyuki Tagoshi"", ids = ""11833705"")",,a8375950b1a9766ac59c156a60a6e1c9b16d4a14; 704a1600f990fa66e7fa67151520db081a70e6a7; 81a65f23474ffceb2481836328608102950da979; 473aed5ddabee5daec75829b8e0e430da4e53019; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 9137dd99f7de02f8dcae8111b44167525edbeaac; fa3989bdd11e37fa2bacba3e3ec9485003f2dec1; 7c8976b3f9de6a1be1b7c848e08d215fff558dae; d477dd0d828be3477fcd1965a61b74ebb1d56f78; e41ba5dc12c79a64dfa905c0328f95976252ffe0; d2d9f624be3f110fd71ae46e9d5c81d4e8961c39; 69e7c4b6d1d6f07f13a7b75f8db3e216f8b1866d; 5a60dbbe8379605c0e2783a26f5f64d94d736a52; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; bad8c3615100440787d6f2a873ece35e1f48ced5; 94f4592d01b0aab240dc0102ecb30bf1e1553c24; 92a3aa94929f883ab496e831c767fc201f0974b9; 790e3f79c46e1e5761fdb1cbbc6fd1670435c761; a068e124994b1028876049773e6700a3a8c99103; 3895f15a0b035af5bfd174e1cbe104494df5bfff; f4a4a0d9f06e278bcbe1182da748d4702ba82542; 2d8bc065924c4729e15b565eca0e7b06a8077b2c; 0cb6aa12bf7009449fa07e32d299b281a90a7d0c,arXiv: General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology,,
0dd31859d082754c39f401f400ad047f4b89e5d8,Perinatal Lead (Pb) Exposure and Cortical Neuron-Specific DNA Methylation in Male Mice,": Lead (Pb) exposure is associated with a wide range of neurological deficits. Environmental exposures may impact epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, and can affect neurodevelopmental outcomes over the life-course. Mating mice were obtained from a genetically invariant C57BL/6J background agouti viable yellow Avy strain. Virgin dams (a/a) were randomly assigned 0 ppm (control), 2.1 ppm (low), or 32 ppm (high) Pb-acetate water two weeks prior to mating with male mice (Avy/a), and this continued through weaning. At age 10 months, cortex neuronal nuclei were separated with NeuNâº antibodies in male mice to investigate neuron-specific genome-wide promoter DNA methylation using the Roche NimbleGen Mouse 3x720K CpG Island Promoter Array in nine pooled samples (three per dose). Several probes reached p-value < 10-5 , all of which were hypomethylated: 12 for high Pb (minimum false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.16, largest intensity ratio difference = -2.1) and 7 for low Pb (minimum FDR = 0.56, largest intensity ratio difference = -2.2). Consistent with previous results in bulk tissue, we observed a weak association between early-life exposure to Pb and DNA hypomethylation, with some affected genes related to neurodevelopment or cognitive function.

efce07382f5acc975130a4f8f3fc90afe9236030,Adaptive FDR thresholding of Fourier shell correlation for resolution estimation of cryo-EM maps,"Fourier shell correlation (FSC) has become a standard quantity for resolution estimation in electron cryo-microscopy. However, the resolution determination step is still subjective and not fully automated as it involves a series of map interventions before FSC computation and includes the selection of a common threshold. Here, we apply the statistical methods of permutation sampling and false discovery rate (FDR) control to the resolution-dependent correlation measure. The approach allows fully automated and mask-free resolution determination based on adaptive thresholding of FSC curves. We demonstrate the applicability for global, local and directional resolution estimation and show that the developed criterion termed FDR-FSC gives realistic resolution estimates based on a statistical significance criterion while eliminating the need of any map manipulations. The algorithms are implemented in a user-friendly GUI based software tool termed SPoC (https://github.com/MaximilianBeckers/SPOC).",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Maximilian Beckers"", ids = ""49212971""); list(name = ""Carsten Sachse"", ids = ""144516384"")",,473aed5ddabee5daec75829b8e0e430da4e53019; bdc3d618db015b2f17cd76224a942bfdfc36dc73; 794c364f77621bee08b7985c51ef5c9169f4442c,bioRxiv,,
a87d84c2f3e075cdff09fd79af3fe60373434004,The association of genome-wide significant spirometric loci with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease susceptibility.,"Two recent metaanalyses of genome-wide association studies conducted by the CHARGE and SpiroMeta consortia identified novel loci yielding evidence of association at or near genome-wide significance (GWS) with FEV(1) and FEV(1)/FVC. We hypothesized that a subset of these markers would also be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) susceptibility. Thirty-two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near 17 genes in 11 previously identified GWS spirometric genomic regions were tested for association with COPD status in four COPD case-control study samples (NETT/NAS, the Norway case-control study, ECLIPSE, and the first 1,000 subjects in COPDGene; total sample size, 3,456 cases and 1,906 controls). In addition to testing the 32 spirometric GWS SNPs, we tested a dense panel of imputed HapMap2 SNP markers from the 17 genes located near the 32 GWS SNPs and in a set of 21 well studied COPD candidate genes. Of the previously identified GWS spirometric genomic regions, three loci harbored SNPs associated with COPD susceptibility at a 5% false discovery rate: the 4q24 locus including FLJ20184/INTS12/GSTCD/NPNT, the 6p21 locus including AGER and PPT2, and the 5q33 locus including ADAM19. In conclusion, markers previously associated at or near GWS with spirometric measures were tested for association with COPD status in data from four COPD case-control studies, and three loci showed evidence of association with COPD susceptibility at a 5% false discovery rate.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Peter J.

c6110d9bff0ceba0f0f117d185b512625ce937f0,Searching ChIP-seq genomic islands for combinatorial regulatory codes in mouse embryonic stem cells,"BackgroundTo facilitate deciphering underlying transcriptional regulatory circuits in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, recent ChIP-seq data provided genome-wide binding locations of several key transcription factors (TFs); meanwhile, existing efforts profiled gene expression in ES cells and in their early differentiated state. It has been shown that the gene expression profiles are correlated with the binding of these TFs. However, it remains unclear whether other TFs, referred to as cofactors, participate the gene regulation by collaborating with the ChIP-seq TFs.ResultsBased on our analyses of the ES gene expression profiles and binding sites of potential cofactors in vicinity of the ChIP-seq TF binding locations, we identified a list of co-binding features that show significantly different characteristics between different gene expression patterns (activated or repressed gene expression in ES cells) at a false discovery rate of 10%. Gene classification with a subset of the identified features achieved up to 20% improvement over classification only based on the ChIP-seq TFs. More than 1/3 of reasoned regulatory roles of cofactor candidates involved in these features are supported by existing literatures. Finally, the predicted target genes of the majority candidates present expected expression change in another independent data set, which serves as a supplementary validation of these candidates.ConclusionsOur results revealed a list of combinatorial genomic features that are significantly associated with gene expression in ES cells, suggesting potential cofactors of the ChIP-seq TFs for gene regulation.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Gong Chen"", ids = ""33308347""); list(name = ""Qing Zhou"", ids = ""47634166"")",090f9555943008c09d69721c4a87d2f8aacc7742; 959354755467caf0d5510003f8128f2404d2349b; 969ad456ed87a84a193480f6262e48de9b789c58; bce93e089bd3c99922e9294a208186a11846dd45; 2df7aa36bdcf779ae291352e884a7d1ff60ef12a; 25210fa3ddd0d5caef6d1ed74dbb1cfb38ea428a,832946521186e8a1ddbf8d1f41a7ebb22275269d; 58d05f28a18e25436d4d01aeb6f5f4ea25e322c9; 0586680ad2cd22583f9f2e9b7f727a27e1cac01e; 7fa779ef385b024a2c43f6c294eff23e9e0ae997; 9179e7ef29c7c4722da31bd73c62e5379b3b792f; 793674d7fa7ca18f6aeca96df4aba98336de3b13; d9d319a907374018cf7321c0538825e5ba93eb1d; 39c5a9e27872bb5c5b5bcbfd0ab85e62a9f2b653; 528adc169ad7343695d05f1eda2d37339430e8ed; 33a29e8e3f3be019ea95146f72298675712c76ee; 4567bfea9bfaa996683be0e6285821af51578b07; c86900fc9f326e9861adc395c7e4be93dcdb8c2c; 7a182f1e77bcdf48e35fe19b2ea2aaf1d9409c0e; ec3825097fae726fc2e6b4dac0391420acf81cb2; 7391e16f497f7ae09358cbdeedbc40ec5b7a7767; 7607a82f4c45930d9d384591a33f863db92ca617; e4cb7d88fc2229f0c9573cbca77e44d9994141c9; 02def074ade26646f5dfc8c2909ecb012a1fc8e6; 3b3b0d4e789234b2c515018f2c6c03af6f9bf9d0; c0471fe48c4cff474b125892da670385475e8ffc; 71d3ebd6130466e757b0aa8ca01a26171b8d3ce7; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 253fba2a2b4060c4adf47f625764182e67420334; 617133adb92eac80a4095ce5ec60c1f7d2e0ff44; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; f37ff912026877a919fafa116ae3647fcdc579e6; 13d798e37ef78ffd97ab2eab150df8ce96953396; e280b45a66f3a91215517ec1e4c8c6bbb95e73db; 49ec58255c19709c682fc51add9330d97f62a70f; 756aae95b3ccc3d5e5a8fd8d319b0f9501db6e91; f4776ae8e46f370f25bff44db60a7b3c8b04b145; 95cfc59760d98b9d80a2efd6a439bbb5b02ee1b9; 6a206efdc49f8bc22750d5857793e46a64a46c36; e9ccf8c95473548fc3bc8997774fae4b7bd7050b; 6951b07392f74682bb38e9ce75c5d6fdffb2f4e1; 9d061a7b8a86581724ec744df30fbc4fc6cfb721; 1a1b7b9d53752aa9d94e616150b8eaa9a0bb88b8; a831443b03516ece7c0e730e42b7f6be2710fcde; 729cb7a620b4e81b63b281627474020cdfbadd39,BMC Genomics,12,515 - 515
7d5b59b7de2ff472fb593f9c50c99d11d4ab33dd,Density Stress has Minimal Impacts on the Barley or Maize Seedling Transcriptome,"High planting density affects the morphology and productivity of many crop species. Our objectives were to examine the phenotypic and transcriptomic changes that occur during plant density stress in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings. In maize and barley seedlings, density stress impacted several morphological traits. Gene expression profi les were examined in four barley and fi ve maize genotypes grown at low and high plant densities. Only 221 barley and 35 maize genes exhibited differential expression in response to plant density stress. The majority of the gene expression changes were observed in a subset of the genotypes and refl ected minor changes in the level of expression, indicating that the plant density stress imposed in this study did not result in major changes in gene expression. Also, little overlap was observed within barley or maize genotypes in gene expression during density stress, indicating that genotypic differences play a major role in the response to density stress. While it is clear that gene expression differences are involved in morphological changes induced by high plant densities, it is likely that many of these gene expression differences are subtle and restricted to particular tissues and developmental time. PLANT POPULATION DENSITY stress elicits a competitive response between neighboring plants for sunlight, water, and nutrients. Plants detect crowding by attempting to outgrow their neighbors by reallocating their resources into longer stems, longer leaves, and early fl owering (Ballare et al., 1991; Smith and Whitelam, 1997). Other vegetative and reproductive traits such as stem diameter, leaf width, leaf length, number of tillers, biomass per plant, and grain per plant are reduced (Casal, 1988; Hashemi-Dezfouli and Herbert, 1992; Smith and Whitelam, 1997). Even though biomass and grain yield are decreased on a per plant basis as density increases, yield can be increased on a per area unit basis (Duncan, 1958; Hashemi et al., 2005; Silva et al., 2007; Tollenaar, 1989). Plant breeders have understood this relationship and have been breeding for more density-tolerant plants to push the optimum plant density and further increase grain yield per unit area (Cox, 1996; Hashemi et al., 2005; Sarlangue et al., 2007; Tollenaar and Wu, 1999; Widdicombe and Th elen, 2002). In maize (Zea mays L.), plant density has increased from 39,520 plants haâ€“1 in the 1960s to 66,690 plants haâ€“1 in 2005 by both increasing planting rates and reducing row spacing, resulting in an increase of 21% in grain yield per hectare (Cardwell, 1982; Elmore and Abendroth, 2006). Th e ability of plant breeders to select for this trait indicates that there is genetic variation in the response to high plant densities. Several groups have assessed transcriptional changes that are induced by plant density stress and shade (a component of density stress). Several genes (2 out of 15) were found to exhibit allelic diff erences in transcript accumulation in Published in The Plant Genome 4:47â€“54.

6e423131c6085373534ff5f2f38b4425bbff784d,A Powerful Procedure for Pathway-Based Meta-analysis Using Summary Statistics Identifies 43 Pathways Associated with Type II Diabetes in European Populations,"Meta-analysis of multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has become an effective approach for detecting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with complex traits. However, it is difficult to integrate the readily accessible SNP-level summary statistics from a meta-analysis into more powerful multi-marker testing procedures, which generally require individual-level genetic data. We developed a general procedure called Summary based Adaptive Rank Truncated Product (sARTP) for conducting gene and pathway meta-analysis that uses only SNP-level summary statistics in combination with genotype correlation estimated from a panel of individual-level genetic data. We demonstrated the validity and power advantage of sARTP through empirical and simulated data. We conducted a comprehensive pathway-based meta-analysis with sARTP on type 2 diabetes (T2D) by integrating SNP-level summary statistics from two large studies consisting of 19,809 T2D cases and 111,181 controls with European ancestry. Among 4,713 candidate pathways from which genes in neighborhoods of 170 GWAS established T2D loci were excluded, we detected 43 T2D globally significant pathways (with Bonferroni corrected p-values < 0.05), which included the insulin signaling pathway and T2D pathway defined by KEGG, as well as the pathways defined according to specific gene expression patterns on pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and bladder carcinoma. Using summary data from 8 eastern Asian T2D GWAS with 6,952 cases and 11,865 controls, we showed 7 out of the 43 pathways identified in European populations remained to be significant in eastern Asians at the false discovery rate of 0.1. We created an R package and a web-based tool for sARTP with the capability to analyze pathways with thousands of genes and tens of thousands of SNPs.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Han Zhang"", ids = ""144243521""); list(name = ""William Wheeler"", ids = ""144778415""); list(name = ""Paula L.

Neuroanatomical Profiles of Treatment-resistance in Patients with Schizophrenia,"s for the Sixth Biennial SIRS Conference S290 Poster Session II 1Johns Hopkins University, Kennedy Krieger Institute; 2Johns Hopkins University Background: The thalamus, a critical node in which multiple cerebral circuits converge, is organized into multiple subnuclei, classified as either firstorder (receiving peripheral sensory input) or higher-order (receiving input primarily from the cortex). Higher-order nuclei are of particular salience in psychotic disorders, as they appear to control cortico-cortical information transmission, possibly through regulation of neuronal synchrony. Substantial evidence has demonstrated abnormalities of thalamo-cortical connectivity in schizophrenia, generally with hyperconnectivity with sensorimotor and temporal cortices and hypoconnectivity with frontal regions. We took advantage of the spatial resolution of 7T (voxels of 3.375 mm3 vs 27 mm3 at 3T) to preliminarily assess resting state connectivity between specific thalamic nuclei and cortical regions in schizophrenia. Methods: Resting state fMRI scans were obtained for 14 SCZ patients (mean age 39.5, mean disease duration 18.8 years) and 14 matched controls (smoking, age, sex) using a Phillps 7T imaging system, with GRE EPI (TR/TE/ FA=2000/22ms/60o, voxel=2.5mm iso, 54 slices, 7min. Data analysis was carried out with SPM8 / Matlab6. Preprocessing included realignment, slice time correction, co-registration, segmentation, normalization; nuisance removal (CompCor), regression of global mean and motion parameters; spatially smoothing (5mm kernel) and temporal filtering (0.01-0.1Hz). Seed-based analysis was carried out using thalamic sub-regions as described in the Oxford Thalamic Connectivity Atlas (seven regions based on anatomic connectivity rather than histology), and whole brain connectivity maps (z values) to each seed were calculated. Second-level t-tests were performed to examine differential connectivity between SCZ patients and controls (thresholded at a voxellevel of p<.001 and multiple-comparisons corrected at a cluster-level threshold of p<.05). Effect size was estimated with Cohenâ€™s d. The IBASPM116 atlas was used to identify anatomical regions within the significant clusters. Results: Both reduced and enhanced functional connectivity between the thalamus and multiple brain regions were observed. Statistically significant differences between scz and controls were detected in 47 regions, with particularly strong differences between scz and control in thalamo-temporal cortex connectivity, consistent with previous results at 3T. The same analysis was performed but with seeds placed in each of the seven thalamic subregions defined by the Oxford thalamic connectivity atlas. Enhanced connectivity was observed between all thalamic sub-regions and the motor cortex. Enhanced connectivity to the temporal cortex was detected in several thalamic sub-regions, but not sub-region 7, which has the highest anatomical connection probability in controls. Reduced functional connectivity in SCZ was detected between thalamic sub-regions 4, 6, and 7, and prefrontal and cingulate cortex. Discussion: Our results provide preliminary evidence of changes in resting state thalamo-cortical connectivity in schizophrenia that are specific to particular thalamic subregions. If confirmed by larger scale studies, identifying altered functional connectivity patterns of specific thalamic subnuclei may provide important clues about the pathogenic process in schizophrenia, with the potential of serving as biomarkers for use in therapeutic development.

NEUROANATOMICAL PROFILES OF TREATMENT-RESISTANCE IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA Eric Plitman*,1, Yusuke Iwata1, Shinichiro Nakajima1, Jun Ku Chung1, Raihaan Patel2, Fernando Caravaggio1, Julia Kim1, Vincenzo De Luca1, Sofia Chavez1, Gary Remington1, M. Mallar Chakravarty2, Philip Gerretsen1, Ariel Graff-Guerrero1 1Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, University of Toronto; 2Douglas Mental Health University Institute, McGill University Background: About 20 to 35% of patients with schizophrenia show partial or no response to standard first-line antipsychotic treatment and are thus believed to have treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Notably, the antipsychotic clozapine (CLZ) has been reported to have superior efficacy compared to other agents for the treatment of TRS. However, a subset of patients still do not respond to CLZ treatment and are thus considered to have ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia (UTRS). Overall, the pathophysiology associated with UTRS appears to be different than TRS, yet both remain elusive. In light of the unknown factors underlying UTRS and TRS, along with the widely reported structural alterations that exist in patients with schizophrenia, our study aimed to examine subcortical structure volumes and cortical thickness in patients with UTRS, patients with TRS responding to CLZ (henceforth, TRS), patients responding to a firstline antipsychotic (treatment non-resistant schizophrenia (TnRS)), and healthy controls (HC). We hypothesized that deficits in subcortical structure volumes and cortical thickness would exist within the UTRS group compared to other groups. Methods: As of December 2017, the sample consisted of a total of 94 participants, including 24 patients with UTRS, 24 patients with TRS, 21 patients with TnRS, and 25 HCs. Participants underwent a 3-dimensional T1-weighted scan in a 3T MRI machine. The MAGeT-Brain segmentation algorithm was used to acquire volumes of the thalamus, striatum, globus pallidus, hippocampus, and amygdala. Cortical thickness was estimated using the CIVET processing pipeline. Total brain volume was obtained using the BEaST method. Group comparisons were performed using analyses of covariance and post-hoc comparisons. Results: Group volumetric differences were identified bilaterally within the thalamus, striatum, and globus pallidus (p<0.01). Post-hoc investigations revealed that bilateral thalamic volumes were smaller in the UTRS group compared to the HC group (p<0.01), bilateral striatal volumes were larger in the TnRS group compared to the UTRS and HC groups (p<0.01), and bilateral globus pallidus volumes were larger in the TnRS group compared to the HC group (p<0.01). No differences in hippocampal, amygdala, or total brain volume were observed. At a 5% false discovery rate, widespread cortical thinning was identified in both the UTRS and TRS groups compared to the TnRS and HC groups; this effect was stronger and more diffuse in the UTRS group. Discussion: Our findings suggest that thalamic volume deficits might be a distinct feature of UTRS. Contrastingly, striatal and globus pallidus volume enlargement may be associated with first-line antipsychotic response or treatment. Cortical thinning is apparent in both the UTRS and TRS groups. In many cases, structural compromise appears to follow a continuum of response, whereby deficits are most severe in UTRS patients, followed by TRS patients, who are followed by TnRS patients and HCs.

NEURAL CORRELATES IN MUSICAL DEFICITS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA Ken Sawada*,1, Sanae Hatada2, Ryoshuke Fujito3, William Honer4 1Kochi Medical School; 2Tosa Rehabilitation College; 3Fujito Hospital; 4University of British Columbia Background: Several studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia have low musical ability that correlates with poor cognitive functions and severe negative symptoms. Recently, using surface-based analysis, we reported that thinner cortical thickness in the left temporal, parietal, and inferior frontal regions is associated with lower musical ability in schizophrenia. Interestingly, thicker cortical thickness in the left supramarginal region correlates with lower musical ability in controls. Musical deficits such as congenital amusia was shown to contribute to white and grey matter pathophysiology in schizophrenia. We, therefore, sought to investigate diffusion tensor images (DTI) of patients with schizophrenia using an automated probabilistic tractography algorithm.",2018,Psychology,"list(name = ""Eric Plitman"", ids = ""5322716""); list(name = ""Yusuke Iwata"", ids = ""5352766""); list(name = ""Shinichiro Nakajima"", ids = ""34817079""); list(name = ""Jun Ku Chung"", ids = ""3750535""); list(name = ""Raihaan Patel"", ids = ""7323732""); list(name = ""Fernando Caravaggio"", ids = ""5888459""); list(name = ""Julia Kim"", ids = ""47964935""); list(name = ""Vincenzo De Luca"", ids = ""40585923""); list(name = ""Sofia Chavez"", ids = ""144995460""); list(name = ""Gary J.

The authors recently performed a prospective caseâ€“control study, including 36 unrelated patients with PV from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. All patients were diagnosed according to the standard criteria: (i) clinical features: a mucocutaneous blistering disorder; (ii) histopathology: a skin or a mucosal biopsy showing suprabasal acantholysis and clefting; and (iii) immunopathology: direct or indirect immunofluorescence to show IgG antibodies that bind to the intercellular spaces of the epidermis (1). Patients with neoplasia or paraneoplastic pemphigus (2) were not included. All patients were non-Jewish, and all except one patient had both parents and grandparents born in Brazil. DNA extraction was performed using the DTAB/CTAB method (3). Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing at the DRB1 locus was performed after DNA extraction using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with sequence-specific oligonucleotides (PCR-SSO) using LABType kits (One Lambda, Inc., Canoga Park, CA) (4, 5). HLA phenotypes were assigned to each individual based on the oligotyping results. Phenotypic and allelic frequencies were compared with those from a collected DNA bank of healthy volunteers donors registered in the national registry of bone marrow donors (REDOME) (6) from Sao Paulo, typed in the same laboratory between January 2008 and April 2009 using the same methods. One hundred sixty-two unrelated individuals were randomly chosen from the data bank (preserving the same ethnicity proportions of study group) and formed the control group. The allele frequencies found in the control group were similar to those reported by previous studies in samples of population from southeastern Brazil (7â€“9). Unlike other researchers, the authors of this study decided to not select individuals â€“ cases or controls â€“ from a homogeneous ethnic group, based on the premise that the Brazilian population is one of the most heterogeneous populations in the world as a result of five centuries of admixture between Europeans, Africans, and Amerindians, which produces, at the individual level, a significant dissociation of color and genomic ancestry (10). Moreover, evidence shows that the possible effect of population stratification is likely to be small in most situations and decreases as the number of admixed ethnicities increases (11, 12). Two-tailed Fisherâ€™s exact test was used to detect significant deviations in allele frequency from controls; a P value â‰¤0.05 was considered a significant result. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by the Woolf method (13) (or by the modified method described by Haldane (14)). Statistical analysis was performed using spss for Mac version 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). A correction for multiple testing with the false discovery rate method (15, 16) was applied after the identification of alleles in PV patients displaying significant deviation in frequency from controls. The distribution of DRB1 genotypes in the patients and the controls was in Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium for patients (P = 0.82876) and for the controls (P = 0.83123). After correction for multiple comparisons, the null hypothesis was rejected for the association of PV with the alleles DRB1*04:02, DRB1*08:04, and DRB1*14, with OR (confidence interval 95%) 44.6 (19.2â€“103), 18.6 (8.3â€“41.7), and 4.8 (2.2â€“10.4), respectively. The authors report here for the first time a strong association of the DRB1*08:04 allele and PV in a Brazilian highly admixed cohort. Previous studies may have failed to identify this association because they did not include populations that have individuals of African origins. High-resolution typing of nearby loci DQA1 and DQB1 is necessary to differentiate if the association is inherent to the HLA-DRB1*08:04 allele or to a specific haplotype.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Roland Weber"", ids = ""145743804""); list(name = ""FlÃ¡via Paula MagalhÃ£es Monteiro"", ids = ""152434555""); list(name = ""G.

9f083877858304658835cfa47da6fc1124ec1d4b,Immunogenetic factors in early immune control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection: Evaluation of HLA class I amino acid variants in two African populations.,"Immune control of HIV-1 infection depends heavily on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses restricted by diverse HLA class I molecules. Recent work has uncovered specific amino acid residues (AARs) that seem to dictate the extent of immune control in African Americans, which prompted us to test these emerging hypotheses in seroconverters (SCs) from southern and eastern Africa. Based on data from 196 Zambians and 76 Rwandans with fully resolved HLA alleles and pre-therapy HIV-1 viral loads (VL) in the first 3- to 36-month of infection (>2300 person-visits), four AARs of primary interest (positions 63, 97, 116 and 245 in the mature HLA-B protein) were found to explain 8.1% and 15.8% of variance in set-point VL for these cohorts (Pâ€¯=â€¯.024 and 7.5â€¯Ã—â€¯10-6, respectively). Two AARs not reported previously (167S in HLA-B and 116F in HLA-C) also showed relatively consistent associations with VL (adjusted Pâ€¯=â€¯.009-.069), while many population-specific associations were also noted (false discovery rate <0.05). Extensive and often strong linkage disequilibrium among neighboring AAR variants called for more extensive analyses of AAR haplotypes in diverse cohorts before the structural basis of antigen presentation can be fully comprehended.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Howard W.

177f2ac22a44e3474b0649a29d3d2a2e841f7105,False discovery rate regression: an application to neural synchrony detection in primary visual cortex.,"Many approaches for multiple testing begin with the assumption that all tests in a given study should be combined into a global false-discovery-rate analysis. But this may be inappropriate for many of today's large-scale screening problems, where auxiliary information about each test is often available, and where a combined analysis can lead to poorly calibrated error rates within different subsets of the experiment. To address this issue, we introduce an approach called false-discovery-rate regression that directly uses this auxiliary information to inform the outcome of each test. The method can be motivated by a two-groups model in which covariates are allowed to influence the local false discovery rate, or equivalently, the posterior probability that a given observation is a signal. This poses many subtle issues at the interface between inference and computation, and we investigate several variations of the overall approach. Simulation evidence suggests that: (1) when covariate effects are present, FDR regression improves power for a fixed false-discovery rate; and (2) when covariate effects are absent, the method is robust, in the sense that it does not lead to inflated error rates. We apply the method to neural recordings from primary visual cortex. The goal is to detect pairs of neurons that exhibit fine-time-scale interactions, in the sense that they fire together more often than expected due to chance. Our method detects roughly 50% more synchronous pairs versus a standard FDR-controlling analysis.

e2f170ab04587e3af41aa7b71a901463c6f98df1,Proteomic profiling of S-acylated macrophage proteins identifies a role for palmitoylation in mitochondrial targeting of phospholipid scramblase 3.,"S-Palmitoylation, the reversible post-translational acylation of specific cysteine residues with the fatty acid palmitate, promotes the membrane tethering and subcellular localization of proteins in several biological pathways. Although inhibiting palmitoylation holds promise as a means for manipulating protein targeting, advances in the field have been hampered by limited understanding of palmitoylation enzymology and consensus motifs. In order to define the complement of S-acylated proteins in the macrophage, we treated RAW 264.7 macrophage membranes with hydroxylamine to cleave acyl thioesters, followed by biotinylation of newly exposed sulfhydryls and streptavidin-agarose affinity chromatography. Among proteins identified by LC-MS/MS, S-acylation status was established by spectral counting to assess enrichment under hydroxylamine versus mock treatment conditions. Of 1183 proteins identified in four independent experiments, 80 proteins were significant for S-acylation at false discovery rate = 0.05, and 101 significant at false discovery rate = 0.10. Candidate S-acylproteins were identified from several functional categories, including membrane trafficking, signaling, transporters, and receptors. Among these were 29 proteins previously biochemically confirmed as palmitoylated, 45 previously reported as putative S-acylproteins in proteomic screens, 24 not previously associated with palmitoylation, and three presumed false-positives. Nearly half of the candidates were previously identified by us in macrophage detergent-resistant membranes, suggesting that palmitoylation promotes lipid raft-localization of proteins in the macrophage. Among the candidate novel S-acylproteins was phospholipid scramblase 3 (Plscr3), a protein that regulates apoptosis through remodeling the mitochondrial membrane. Palmitoylation of Plscr3 was confirmed through (3)H-palmitate labeling. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis of a cluster of five cysteines (Cys159-161-163-164-166) abolished palmitoylation, caused Plscr3 mislocalization from mitochondrion to nucleus, and reduced macrophage apoptosis in response to etoposide, together suggesting a role for palmitoylation at this site for mitochondrial targeting and pro-apoptotic function of Plscr3. Taken together, we propose that manipulation of protein palmitoylation carries great potential for intervention in macrophage biology via reprogramming of protein localization.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""B Alex Merrick"", ids = ""144531194""); list(name = ""Suraj Dhungana"", ids = ""5102461""); list(name = ""J A Gareth Williams"", ids = ""143652264""); list(name = ""Jim J Aloor"", ids = ""5847323""); list(name = ""Shyamal D.

Predictive ability of SDAI remission for functional and structural outcomes was shown by data from clinical trials, but has not been proven in a T2T implementing cohort. Objectives To examine if achieving SDAI remission is a predictor of good functional and structural outcomes in a T2T implementing cohort. Methods The T2T Epidemiological Study is a multi-centre, prospective cohort study, in which RA patients with moderate to high disease activity were enrolled and treated with T2T for 72 weeks. The disease activity was assessed every 12 weeks and the treatment was adjusted accordingly. Primary outcomes were HAQ and Î”mTSS at week 72. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine association between SDAI remission at week 24 and the two primary outcomes. Missing data were imputed using the multiple imputation method. Statistical significance levels were adjusted for multiple comparison using False Discovery Rate and BH methods. Results Of total 318 enrolled patients, 244 patients followed up for 72 weeks were analysed. Patient characteristics were as follows: female, 77%; mean age, 61; mean disease duration, 57 months. At week 24, 33% achieved SDAI remission. At week 72, 50% achieved SDAI remission, 61% achieved HAQ remission (â‰¤0.5) and 73% showed Î”mTSS p= 0.009], baseline HAQ [0.30 (0.19-0.47), p =2.4x10 -7 ], absence of history of joint replacement related to RA [9.90 (1.57-62.5), p =0.015] and SDAI remission at week 24 [3.24 (1.57-6.71), p =0.0015]. Factors associated with Î”mTSS p =0.0037], serum MMP-3 level at week 24 [0.998 (0.996-1.000), p =0.035] and SDAI remission at week 24 [3.21 (1.46-7.02), p =0.0036]. Conclusions SDAI remission at week 24 is a significant predictor of good functional and structural outcomes at week 72 in the T2T implementing cohort. References Ann Rheum Dis 2010;68:631-637. 2.

ae25e039dada25091da1a61323eedc9817c08b26,The Genetic Basis of Natural Variation in Drosophila melanogaster Immune Defense against Enterococcus faecalis,"Dissecting the genetic basis of natural variation in disease response in hosts provides insights into the coevolutionary dynamics of host-pathogen interactions. Here, a genome-wide association study of Drosophila melanogaster survival after infection with the Gram-positive entomopathogenic bacterium Enterococcus faecalis is reported. There was considerable variation in defense against E. faecalis infection among inbred lines of the Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with six genes with a significant (p < 10-08, corresponding to a false discovery rate of 2.4%) association with survival, none of which were canonical immune genes. To validate the role of these genes in immune defense, their expression was knocked-down using RNAi and survival of infected hosts was followed, which confirmed a role for the genes krishah and S6k in immune defense. We further identified a putative role for the Bomanin gene BomBc1 (also known as IM23), in E. faecalis infection response.

7d0b5723a0a1fdd786f2525736bed84c68f53086,Integrated identification and quantification error probabilities for shotgun proteomics,"Protein quantification by label-free shotgun proteomics experiments is plagued by a multitude of error sources. Typical pipelines for identifying differentially expressed proteins use intermediate filters in an attempt to control the error rate. However, they often ignore certain error sources and, moreover, regard filtered lists as completely correct in subsequent steps. These two indiscretions can easily lead to a loss of control of the false discovery rate (FDR). We propose a probabilistic graphical model, Triqler, that propagates error information through all steps, employing distributions in favor of point estimates, most notably for missing value imputation. The model outputs posterior probabilities for fold changes between treatment groups, highlighting uncertainty rather than hiding it. We analyzed 3 engineered datasets and achieved FDR control and high sensitivity, even for truly absent proteins. In a bladder cancer clinical dataset we discovered 35 proteins at 5% FDR, whereas the original study discovered 1 and MaxQuant/Perseus 4 proteins at this threshold. Compellingly, these 35 proteins showed enrichment for functional annotation terms, whereas the top ranked proteins reported by MaxQuant/Perseus showed no enrichment.

fc4ec7830089aae8603e3203a512372f17b5dc86,Imputation of Truncated p-Values For Meta-Analysis Methods and Its Genomic Application.,"Microarray analysis to monitor expression activities in thousands of genes simultaneously has become routine in biomedical research during the past decade. a tremendous amount of expression profiles are generated and stored in the public domain and information integration by meta-analysis to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes has become popular to obtain increased statistical power and validated findings. Methods that aggregate transformed p-value evidence have been widely used in genomic settings, among which Fisher's and Stouffer's methods are the most popular ones. In practice, raw data and p-values of DE evidence are often not available in genomic studies that are to be combined. Instead, only the detected DE gene lists under a certain p-value threshold (e.g., DE genes with p-value < 0.001) are reported in journal publications. The truncated p-value information makes the aforementioned meta-analysis methods inapplicable and researchers are forced to apply a less efficient vote counting method or naÃ¯vely drop the studies with incomplete information. The purpose of this paper is to develop effective meta-analysis methods for such situations with partially censored p-values. We developed and compared three imputation methods-mean imputation, single random imputation and multiple imputation-for a general class of evidence aggregation methods of which Fisher's and Stouffer's methods are special examples. The null distribution of each method was analytically derived and subsequent inference and genomic analysis frameworks were established. Simulations were performed to investigate the type Ierror, power and the control of false discovery rate (FDR) for (correlated) gene expression data. The proposed methods were applied to several genomic applications in colorectal cancer, pain and liquid association analysis of major depressive disorder (MDD). The results showed that imputation methods outperformed existing naÃ¯ve approaches. Mean imputation and multiple imputation methods performed the best and are recommended for future applications.",2014,Mathematics; Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shaowu Tang"", ids = ""1947112""); list(name = ""Ying Ding"", ids = ""144481321""); list(name = ""Etienne Sibille"", ids = ""49533612""); list(name = ""Jeffrey S.

40115641f4e445bc7f001aa25cb46c7729a328bb,OPRM1 genetic polymorphisms are associated with the plasma nicotine metabolite cotinine concentration in methadone maintenance patients: a cross sectional study,"Majority of the heroin-dependent patients smoke cigarettes. Although it has been reported that the OPRM1 genetic polymorphism is associated with the brain mu-opioid receptor binding potential in cigarette smokers, there is no direct evidence showing the impact of plasma cotinine, a nicotine metabolite, on treatment responses to methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). In this study, we aimed to test the hypothesis that the genetic polymorphisms in the OPRM1 are associated with the methadone treatment responses and the severity of cigarette smoking directly measured by the plasma concentration of cotinine in a Taiwanese MMT cohort. Fifteen OPRM1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected and genotyped on DNA samples of 366 MMT patients. Plasma concentrations of cotinine were measured by cotinine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The plasma cotinine concentration had positive correlation with concentrations of methadone (P=0.042) and its metabolite 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenyl-pyrrolidine (P=0.037). Methadone treatment non-responders, defined by a positive urine morphine test, had a higher plasma concentration of cotinine (P=0.005), but a lower plasma concentration-to-dose ratio of both R- and S-methadone (P=0.001 and 0.012, respectively) than the responders. OPRM1 genetic variants, rs1074287, rs6912029, rs1799971, rs12209447, rs510769, rs3798676, rs553202, rs7748401, rs495491, rs10457090, rs589046, rs3778152 and rs563649, were significantly associated with the plasma concentration of cotinine when using recessive model for genotypes (general linear model (GLM), P<0.038; false discovery rate (FDR)<0.035) and additive model for allele types (GLM, P<0.03; FDR<0.049) in association analyses.

4c8293ae34b51da2bee80111dfcd5d1901728576,Imprinted Genes â€¦ and the Number Is?,"Genomic imprinting in mammals results in the expression of the alleles of a given gene being dependent on their parental origin. Although the existence of imprinted genes was postulated to explain aberrant development of uniparental embryos [1], it wasn't until 1991 that the first imprinted genes were identified by candidate approaches or fortuitously [2]. Given the serious developmental consequences of uniparental embryos, as well as some human syndromes associated with parental-specific deletion of particular chromosome regions, there has been great interest in discovering imprinted genes. As such, several unbiased approaches have been developed in the last 20 years with the goal of obtaining a complete list of imprinted genes. These approaches typically involved identifying genes that were present/absent in complete or partially uniparental embryos, although regions harbouring allele-specific DNA or chromatin modifications have also been used as an indicator of imprinted genes [3]. Earlier studies suggested that imprinted genes likely numbered in the low hundreds. Thus, it was startling to the imprinting community in 2010 when Gregg and colleagues reported >1,000 potential tissue-specific imprinted genes [4]. How could so many have been missed? In fact, others had previously used similar methodology but reported far fewer new imprinted genes [5], [6]. The answer, as discussed in a report from DeVeale and colleagues in this issue of PLoS Genetics [7], may not be that so many imprinted genes were missed, but that the limitations of the novel technology may not have been fully appreciated. 
 
The experimental strategy that Gregg et al. and Babak and colleagues [4], [5] used to discover imprinted genes was to perform quantitative, whole-transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-seq) of samples from reciprocal hybrids (fetal or adult brain tissue from F1 hybrid mice, Figure 1) and to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at which one parental allele is preferentially expressed. Comparison of reciprocal cross samples should rule out genetic effects and mitigate against some experimental noise. The approach is conceptually simple, but it requires robust statistical methods to account for false positives and it is probably fair to say that this remains an area of methodological development.

By reanalysing mRNA-seq datasets from embryonic day 15 (e15) brain published by Gregg et al. [4] and e17.5 brain (their own, [5]), and using the same statistical approach, DeVeale et al. detect similar numbers of known imprinted genes. However, there was far less overlap in the new imprinted genes predicted from the two experiments: each predicted 400â€“500 candidates, but only about 50 were in common. Although these studies assayed fetal brain from different times, DeVeale and colleagues suspected that the discrepancy was more likely caused by technical issues in generation, mapping, or analysis of the mRNA-seq data. 
 
A prerequisite in analysing large sequence datasets is to know how many candidates could appear â€œby chanceâ€ and to set thresholds to account for this. Although a false discovery rate (FDR) for a dataset can be predicted, there may be sources of experimental noise in the data that are not fully taken into account. Alternatively, it may be possible to determine an FDR empirically. DeVeale and colleagues did so by assuming that SNPs in the same coding exon of an imprinted transcript, but sufficiently distant to be sampled independently, should show the same parental allele expression bias; SNPs discordant in their direction of bias are more likely the consequence of sampling effects at the two positions. Of 1,388 SNP pairs, âˆ¼20% disagreed on direction of bias, suggesting that as many as 40% of the predicted imprinted genes could be false positives. In a second approach, the authors analysed the number of candidates predicted in a â€œmock reciprocalâ€ cross. This involves taking one F1 mRNA-seq dataset and comparing it with a second F1 dataset as if they were from reciprocal crosses. Worryingly, nearly as many candidate genes emerged from the mock reciprocal as a true reciprocal cross once known imprinted genes had been taken into account. 
 
Using the FDRs determined from mock reciprocal crosses to set a threshold of significance, the authors then reanalysed reciprocal cross mRNA-seq datasets from four tissues: e15 and e17.5 whole brain, adult prefrontal cortex, and preoptic area [4], [5]. They detected 53 putative novel imprinted genes, including three that had already been validated by Gregg et al. Discounting 11 that were associated with known imprinted clusters, 42 candidates remained. They went on to verify a number of transcripts using an independent RT-PCR-based assay, including 17 candidates predicted by Gregg et al. (albeit of the â€œcomplex categoryâ€, in which there was discordance between parental allele ratios at different SNPs in the same transcript). Six of their 11 candidates validated with parental origin-specific allelic expression bias, but none of the â€œGregg candidatesâ€ did. Not surprisingly, validation was best in genes with the highest â€œimprinting scoreâ€ (a combination of allelic bias and read depth), including genes with biased parental allele expression in multiple samples and concordant at multiple SNPs. These criteria make sense, but such reasoning does not exclude the possibility that there may be additional imprinted genes among the longer candidate lists that exhibit spatiotemporally restricted imprinted expression. 
 
To account for these discrepant findings, DeVeale and colleagues [7] argue that there are potentially multiple sources of systematic error in quantifying allele-specific expression by mRNA-seq, but whether these in aggregate could explain the substantially greater number of candidate imprinted transcripts reported by Gregg et al. is unclear. Nevertheless, the current study demonstrates the importance of appropriate empirically determined FDRs and extensive validation of new candidates by an independent method. Convergent evidence from other datasets, for example, parental-allele-specific DNA methylation or histone modifications, as they become available, will also be useful [8]. 
 
Transcriptome sequencing has also been applied to imprinted gene identification in the mouse placenta. The placenta is particularly significant in the physiology of imprinting, owing to its role in regulating fetal growth by controlling the supply of nutrients. In this case, an additional confounding factor is expression of genes in maternally derived cells within the placenta that can remain even after careful dissection [9]. Recently, Okae et al. elegantly demonstrated by embryo transfer that genes highly expressed in contaminating maternal decidual tissue, or other maternal cells infiltrating the placenta, can appear imprinted with maternal-allele-specific expression [10]. Using mRNA-seq of reciprocal hybrid placenta, they identified âˆ¼1,000 genes expressed predominantly from the maternal allele. However, imprinted maternal allele expression was unequivocally demonstrated for only one of 269 genes they sought to verify (in some additional cases, genuine imprinted expression could have been obscured by extremely high expression in contaminating maternal tissue). The success rate for genes with paternal-allele-specific expression was much higher (1/6). This important study casts doubt on a number of apparent imprinted genes previously reported to exhibit maternal-allele-specific expression restricted to the placenta. 
 
Where does this leave us? First, there are probably not more than the few hundred imprinted genes that were predicted many years ago. Moreover, with the rapid development of high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, we have an unprecedented opportunity to identify imprinted genes in any species with a sequenced genome. Thus, understanding the roles of imprinted genes in disease, development, and evolution will be within reach. Nevertheless, the studies by DeVeale and Okae suggest that results from high-throughput screens must be carefully interrogated, including substantial validation by alternative methods.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gavin Kelsey"", ids = ""4415644""); list(name = ""Marisa S Bartolomei"", ids = ""1835854"")",70e571c61e265b819f206763d39c7c1a704cd00d; 315be6efb93b31c1644436e8c9365e2b8d9e0903; 7c20adcfe07b23b155a75f7df00ce142306ac2aa; a47d92d046f9a9fe824314dd9fa235e2b9a24d6a; ecfd4bec54b1b071def7c547c1c3be840277a8c3; 15aa612acd4b3d7b5200fc702e04629efaa3def4; 3bb41d58a7be6a12578cac34e4bb70cc7b2f9952; 732e0f9bc560090dd20df47115d0a993edeaf232; f543ebdca09415f74b9d0d14781231e5f835626f; 1d7399acd7f6e2c9cf8e7fab0ffa3344298a4678; 14fca7d1090be8cb5d1bf16e43d375aee84e235e; f9994941c271b4ea4543f9e815f78c5442ffebf1; c6fecc80ff2976d3638b8dda058b50a8776c8bf4; 7f34df12437591bb0772d8237f8e6747f4d99046; d713fea8cfff36b1b615f25541509a24e1e6c82f; 1cbf1178b645d92e94a09348261773e247dea725; 59a0a9d258852c2ee74aa2acc1318418f1b8c94b; 367eca022496dcd9f85777183a7002d3abcebca1; f86326c097f0dad6c0f0ac72231ba0a4434c6e5f; 1e7c995e8732b401b9b86af651a74f1898f47ed1; 652abc942684d03c52982728d6790ebf61677db0; 2ec7e8803dc843fdf32218d7ee14b4f4c04412a4; 52336254407d1f9dde0171e6bc9b096759ae6e26; 45f7fed3bf8b30afa8d61c5e3b639da36a072026; 4108597baeb738007e09a609d83042f50548808a; 8a13520613f3939e9703c6a3cf3fe89da36d7a01; 186354ec21d2006104e61e0b570b63be4c7f2a6f,865006562060ffd191afb7871ef8cbffb15f037e; 258dc4917d17684d15a6099b092cc7b913e7faf7; 29dbd4206eb39402690be454cc7dc70259cd85bb; 08d33cb0b4148f2e82a0771aecbb3c87fc85932b; fc9bec124de29092a25f15f1e0c7c6a1a9c83600; 844b673458edff4f293f88968413ad982b915578; 7d9a611b453c8892a417b5037ac585e0e65513f7; 339d7cde0799cbdd8d894040dbf1074347816603,PLoS Genetics,8,
78ca629ea1338a07559fce251cf2e9d9caf1716b,Epigenetic Alterations Are Associated With Gastric Emptying Disturbances in Diabetes Mellitus,"INTRODUCTION: Epigenetic modifications have been implicated to mediate several complications of diabetes mellitus (DM), especially nephropathy and retinopathy. Our aim was to ascertain whether epigenetic alterations in whole blood discriminate among patients with DM with normal, delayed, and rapid gastric emptying (GE). METHODS: Using the ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with next-generation sequencing) assays, we compared the genome-wide enrichment of 3 histone modifications (i.e., H3K4me3, H3K9ac, and H3K27ac) in buffy coats from 20 diabetic patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and normal (n = 6), delayed (n = 8), or rapid (n = 6) GE. RESULTS: Between patients with DM with delayed vs normal GE, there were 108 and 54 genes that were differentially bound (false discovery rate < 0.05) with H3K27ac and H3K9ac, respectively; 100 genes were differentially bound with H3K9ac in patients with rapid vs normal GE. The differentially bound genes with H3K27ac were functionally linked to the type 2 immune response, particularly Th2 cell activation and function (e.g., CCR3, CRLF2, CXCR4, IL5RA, and IL1RL1) and glucose homeostasis (FBP-1, PDE4A, and CMKLR1). For H3K9ac, the differentially occupied genes were related to T-cell development and function (e.g., ICOS and CCR3) and innate immunity (RELB, CD300LB, and CLEC2D). Compared with normal GE, rapid GE had differential H3K9ac peaks at the promoter site of diverse immunity-related genes (e.g., TNFRSF25 and CXCR4) and genes related to insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. Motif analysis disclosed enrichment of binding sites for transcription factors relevant to the pathogenesis and complications of DM. DISCUSSION: GE disturbances in DM are associated with epigenetic alterations that pertain to dysimmunity, glucose metabolism, and other complications of DM.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Susrutha Puthanmadhom Narayanan"", ids = ""79485008""); list(name = ""Jeongheon Lee"", ids = ""34437020""); list(name = ""Aditya Bhagwate"", ids = ""3268031""); list(name = ""Saatchi Kuwelker"", ids = ""1490513469""); list(name = ""Huihuang Yan"", ids = ""3095887""); list(name = ""Tamas Ordog"", ids = ""2823742""); list(name = ""Adil E Bharucha"", ids = ""4702521"")",,,Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology,11,
1a55c95bf74271d88cd50fec1bf5b1c01022f563,Estimating effect sizes of differentially expressed genes for power and sample-size assessments in microarray experiments.,"In microarray screening for differentially expressed genes using multiple testing, assessment of power or sample size is of particular importance to ensure that few relevant genes are removed from further consideration prematurely. In this assessment, adequate estimation of the effect sizes of differentially expressed genes is crucial because of its substantial impact on power and sample-size estimates. However, conventional methods using top genes with largest observed effect sizes would be subject to overestimation due to random variation. In this article, we propose a simple estimation method based on hierarchical mixture models with a nonparametric prior distribution to accommodate random variation and possible large diversity of effect sizes across differential genes, separated from nuisance, nondifferential genes. Based on empirical Bayes estimates of effect sizes, the power and false discovery rate (FDR) can be estimated to monitor them simultaneously in gene screening. We also propose a power index that concerns selection of top genes with largest effect sizes, calledâ€‚partial power. This new power index could provide a practical compromise for the difficulty in achieving high levels of usualâ€‚overallâ€‚power as confronted in many microarray experiments.

1103054f13deca30d64ec1a916a3d42214822289,Oral Microbiome of Deep and Shallow Dental Pockets In Chronic Periodontitis,"We examined the subgingival bacterial biodiversity in untreated chronic periodontitis patients by sequencing 16S rRNA genes. The primary purpose of the study was to compare the oral microbiome in deep (diseased) and shallow (healthy) sites. A secondary purpose was to evaluate the influences of smoking, race and dental caries on this relationship. A total of 88 subjects from two clinics were recruited. Paired subgingival plaque samples were taken from each subject, one from a probing site depth >5 mm (deep site) and the other from a probing site depth â‰¤3mm (shallow site). A universal primer set was designed to amplify the V4-V6 region for oral microbial 16S rRNA sequences. Differences in genera and species attributable to deep and shallow sites were determined by statistical analysis using a two-part model and false discovery rate. Fifty-one of 170 genera and 200 of 746 species were found significantly different in abundances between shallow and deep sites. Besides previously identified periodontal disease-associated bacterial species, additional species were found markedly changed in diseased sites. Cluster analysis revealed that the microbiome difference between deep and shallow sites was influenced by patient-level effects such as clinic location, race and smoking. The differences between clinic locations may be influenced by racial distribution, in that all of the African Americans subjects were seen at the same clinic. Our results suggested that there were influences from the microbiome for caries and periodontal disease and these influences are independent.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiuchun Ge"", ids = ""5265916""); list(name = ""Rafael RodrÃ­guez"", ids = ""49460406""); list(name = ""My Trinh"", ids = ""48103813""); list(name = ""John Gunsolley"", ids = ""50594984""); list(name = ""Ping Xu"", ids = ""145767092"")",30785323ff3b24bcabbca7725aaf3a44e7a08579; 68238fba9ae26031c50b8172d31f498a78a86597; d2d1f260011eb1f92a1f35ad5e8dedac30aee830; 4613a4b9b5eb94c6a6c9b78616073a294d8c0ba8; b92c4e1d46cadb11d2694547043be7779727f689; 33fe89116d907b11e3ca5359ec232a7f79ca000f; 922ecfe52ac3d039277ec34bd175a2d5a4047d41; 145f048f7bb8ef5e86e64ffaf1d7b2154ab374c9; fed1e9b8ac5eef6f3bbb339ae8edb72dc6d392f5; 6938dfc1de5f8237ae453828dab95a232be2ba7a; d0a547e99cab832f89c1156697c8e298aa066ae2; a2bcafe879ce68b112e8a4ea1ae7e1dbe1eb1027; d12ea4953c47c156154e4fe032d5e56d402086f7; 8863b0d7994f33fac0fb84271f1ef87b4f76e441; 16dedc06849d227187142908aab7c26ae68ffe0b; bf5937f13b95ddb182bd9bf0ce671796083d6801; 20cadfc356ef9416495c87aadf305476f775a9f6; cf82afdb16ee5c59d394d453454836ed4fba1138; 5c8f6ef32218154099b91b0f717f5aa7e16913ff; 06279952bf3adcda53b3dc35050a7b214d5fa136; 8753f4b140bb86b89a36dca35e67bb1ee6bb164e; ec2722aab0cdf2ebfd5f8af17af2ff6c17115697; eaa502181f60ceaa6eee421366c61f6fb06380e7; 7646c6a30fa6d98d996785ce3a95fc3ba55c1fcb; 4f5d696426b6d8fd0525d412450762cec8f4d317; ef8207252e3f175cc4a8219a9ee096981b78f1c7; 0d57b495cacf434493553f3ed7321b1f78fc26b3; 40e6a9f2963c3f130e087bfb7cc7e082134457bb; b33abfff9b95fce5fb9a64b01670c0da150a581b; ccb2d8560c0dfa796fd243cf50dc49163a4e0f09; 5dd730a6342841ebcb2925877e1360dc58668d4f; f553b5da608c63c4ab3110d632dde7c46b6e4e2c; 2d9e5e00f8c388634dca34910e1565a44cc05c1e; ef9bf5f352b4fa2c26a79398385c835112f5025c; 48586b43f67bf8f29a0cfcb73e5b7bd743402a28; 02279e45a849e7702c3dc715708da04297f410e4; 3d6e01062689f59204d3030171eefeb0e543be3d; 8f7489535b9061b316aa2122e09123bfb329e787; 86b2e64265477be3851fc91f58bf254a3981881b; 2c94fda5e8b88b9a044e0686aa8df07a448b54d7; a879e9a2c6d00eaeb4ab38f80baa18ef365e13b3; 491fc9e64f8164ad757b933cab3a557a3d16fa65; 316095f60e1365090872b6c9087783bf53d67c33; 27e6be7364527b7b028855417f159b321256aaf2; ddc86ec2b8a8b554ceb1c447dac344ae6f7be210; 90cc1b23bbe69e97ebcce57d226abd65fe4702d9; fd59e4a2d93a30e4d7e5eabb69413ec46dd73c71; 440e4c2651932338b52a2898dd06403c3d06a767; 199ad2e25577c1e9ae2b2099018afc9ae1160e55; 04fef0924088ede41cc9cd00fdd40175bcecf458; b33ed4bdb964b2b9cb309719d64532156155a8ec; fe28a0fe78fa36d3a2fa75eea30eb69694a30b07; c6ac95797f2926bc869d109cc6ab34648af46ec9; 2043adc5cb5799948545635ea10ed4d9132bf04e; d35f9bebdc05f4be0eeb17802d4a7c3a7b86f648; 562763e789b87f31e22f4afd5e14aea862b47c82; 994ce97bf621bd09cdecb39847c3c62e9fff7dfd; 156c34e6f7c757f8673e3f168404ab2075516a13; 7c2d679ee5b5078376d329a2ddfef016663287d4; 76d69db779bd2e51e244c65e3b8e5e6bf1bafedf; da53dfeaca1fba81020d24239e4fa56f44e5481d; 7692a78422e885f6e1ebad6a93fe679cb622c5e4; 983675eae622388a180e076e447dc3e6e3fb31fd,11f04c9dd9a958894b7b6473857ee4a00943c965; 2368ead848d2fa767adbe287bff4907fdfc795bc; 3402d21dce4f7f6180ef375b3133c352dae26603; 356a4b87a845f30a82ce8c9d184c23e694b86dfb; d5436d23a1c4715d9c82c668316a54f259d30a83; f9a4ab4f910d5a4e32b676dc12d82bae1fb97ca1; d6e5fd3b3a35e5c49bbee601e26cb96eba7e0918; 9b93c7d81fe91dad24070b945065d93c4294b866; 33816e81ed3a6c1ee02bdf54b3586ecd93e44c87; 9b1d95a706fd70260bc0bf0e05b8d7845f457516; f3a75ff7709ecbe9131f70f0a84d4344e20dcf35; 5a82d1a791e17e36c569acd7eaf1e862df151436; 15d3d4425451e3f660753a0816ae70e737ee2d48; 04e2266bdfc70c81963b43e953be6c1ae97560d9; cfc8b8e4434c9580ffef75e141c04fbbfe7f023a; 6a2a328382c735af703055fa7014b15cb944c7da; efdba25b13c217b52790c95a5a7d23b4537fc70e; ca408e4c77951eaec361986dc3e50ef3bde0c161; 8369261566ab3c2b66a5e810b2cf5d29a3d7a6fc; a620dc006f13e6f0edf1fa1d906a548ccde0c7bf; ff09d0dee5630941d72b76b12831e62529883a37; a5fcd88d4bd6532be28309928fa6775b9695bca3; 1016e40b12899d3f409166ada638e1bf62edeb63; 31599ea9b52260fe567871aa89a9e7c54926b537; fea881959ce3e307793faca17481735c1615af5c; 0a422e048daf1e88c4c58c43333f29b55e8370b5; c0f5a646405220c58df6381f8718a034bea57bed; 506eaf44cfd0cbf31429eed4adc473536f60024b; 6a56aa2fde77f51373ad2ca249f04b41dea7a028,PLoS ONE,8,

However, state-of-the-art algorithms for detecting recurrent aberrations fail to detect several known drivers. In this study, we propose RUBIC, an approach that detects recurrent copy number breaks, rather than recurrently amplified or deleted regions. This change of perspective allows for a simplified approach as recursive peak splitting procedures and repeated re-estimation of the background model are avoided. Furthermore, we control the false discovery rate on the level of called regions, rather than at the probe level, as in competing algorithms. We benchmark RUBIC against GISTIC2 (a state-of-the-art approach) and RAIG (a recently proposed approach) on simulated copy number data and on three SNP6 and NGS copy number data sets from TCGA. We show that RUBIC calls more focal recurrent regions and identifies a much larger fraction of known cancer genes.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ewald van Dyk"", ids = ""40588719""); list(name = ""Marlous Hoogstraat"", ids = ""3180086""); list(name = ""Jelle J ten Hoeve"", ids = ""4510311""); list(name = ""Marcel J.

7a99641a5606c282fb39ccaeb1c4989d9e969a33,Polymorphisms in the SUFU gene are associated with organ injury protection and sepsis severity in patients with Enterobacteriacea bacteremia.,"BACKGROUND
Organ injury including acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute lung Injury (ALI) are major contributors to mortality and morbidity in the setting of sepsis. Hedgehog pathway has been recognized as an important mediator in repair of organ injury. There are some clinical predictors associated with the development of organ injury in sepsis; however few host genetic risk factors have been identified and candidate genes for organ injury susceptibility and severity are largely unknown.


METHODS
A prospective cohort study in a tertiary care hospital included 250 adult hospitalized patients with Enterobacteriacea bacteremia. We selected a panel of 69 tagging SNPs for genes in the Hedgehog signaling pathway using the TagSNP functionality of the SNPInfo web server and designed a panel on the GoldenGate Veracode genotyping assay (Illumina). We confirmed Illumina data using Taqman allelic discrimination assays. We assessed SNPs in combination with clinical variables for associations with outcomes and organ injury.


RESULTS
Significant associations were identified using logistic regression models, controlling for age, race and gender. From the 69 tagging SNPs, 5 SNPs were associated with renal function and 2 with APACHEII score after false discovery rate correction. After multivariate analysis SNPs rs10786691 (p=0.03), rs12414407 (p=0.026), rs10748825 (p=0.01), and rs7078511 (p=0.006), all in the suppressor of fused homolog (SUFU) gene, correlated with renal function. Likewise, SUFU SNPs rs7907760 (p=0.009) and rs10748825 (p=0.029) were associated with APACHEII score. SNPs rs12414407 and rs1078825 are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs2296590, a SNP in the 5'-UTR region that is within a predicted transcription factor bind site for CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins. In multivariate analyses functional SNP rs2296590 was correlated with renal function (p=0.004) and APACHEII score (p=0.049).


CONCLUSIONS
Host susceptibility factors play an important role in sepsis development and sepsis related organ injury.

219739351e32902be4605470faa08ae45f5ffe09,Immunomics of Renal Allograft Acute T Cell-Mediated Rejection Biopsies of Tacrolimus- and Belatacept-Treated Patients,"Background Belatacept-based therapy in kidney transplant recipient has been shown to increase long-term renal allograft and patient survival compared with calcineurin inhibitorâ€“based therapy, however, with an increased risk of acute T cell-mediated rejection (aTCMR). An improved understanding of costimulation blockade-resistant rejections could lead to a more personalized approach to belatacept therapy. Here, immunomic profiles of aTCMR biopsies of patients treated with either tacrolimus or belatacept were compared. Methods Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded renal transplant biopsies were used for immunohistochemistry and gene expression analysis using the innovative NanoString technique. To validate NanoString, transcriptomic profiles of patients with and without biopsy-proven aTCMR were compared. Biopsies from 31 patients were studied: 14 tacrolimus-treated patients with aTCMR, 11 belatacept-treated patients with aTCMR, and 6 controls without rejection. Results A distinct pattern was seen in biopsies with aTCMR compared to negative controls: 78 genes had a higher expression in the aTCMR group (false discovery rate P value <.05 to 1.42eâ€“05). The most significant were T cell-associated genes (CD3, CD8, and CD4; P < 1.98e-04), &ggr;-interferon-inducible genes (CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL11, CXCL10, TBX21; P < 1.33e-04) plus effector genes (GNLY, GZMB, ITGAX; P < 2.82e-03). Immunophenotypical analysis of the classic immune markers of the innate and adaptive immune system was comparable between patients treated with either tacrolimus or belatacept. In addition, the transcriptome of both groups was not significantly different. Conclusions In this small pilot study, no difference was found in immunomics of aTCMR biopsies of tacrolimus- and belatacept-treated patients. This suggests that clinically diagnosed aTCMR reflects a final common pathway of allorecognition which is unaffected by the type of immunosuppressive therapy.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Marieke van der Zwan"", ids = ""15147586""); list(name = ""Carla C Baan"", ids = ""6142502""); list(name = ""Robert B.

220e675c40a438f769aff3aaf17eb7f66213eb8e,"76 Attenuation of a Rodent Model of Pulmonary Hypertension: a Novel Role for Sorafenib, a Multikinase Inhibitor.","Drawing from new drug discovery studies is the observation that severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) and cancer pathophysiology share common signal transduction pathways leading to abnormal smooth muscle and endothelial cell (EC) interactions and angioproliferative vasculopathy. Sorafenib (Sor), a chemotherapeutic agent in clinical trials for the treatment of renal cell cancer, is an inhibitor of multiple kinases, including Raf-1 kinase, MAPK, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3, genes implicated in angiogenesis, proliferation, and the inhibition of apoptosis. We therefore tested the hypothesis that Sor will attenuate the development of PH using an established rodent model of the disease. We performed two 3-week hypoxia (FiO2 10%) and SU5416 (a selective VEGFR-2 inhibitor known to dramatically augment hypoxia-induced PH) studies to induce PH in Dahl salt-sensitive rats (SS). Rat groups were normoxia/vehicle (Norm), hypoxia/vehicle (H), H-Su, hypoxia/sorafenib (H-Sor), and hypoxia/sorafenib/ SU5416 (H-Su-Sor). Except for Norm, all rats were kept in hypoxia, whereas the H-Su group received SU5416 at day 1 (20 mg/kg, sc) and Sor was gavaged daily (2.5 mg/kg). Echocardiography, pulmonary artery pressures (PAPs), right ventricular pressures (RVPs), and lung gene microarray analyses were assessed at 3 weeks. Our results showed that H-Su rats developed severe PH compared with Norm, rats in the H alone group had mildly elevated pressures compared with Norm, and no changes were seen in pressures, weights, or remodeling in the H-Sor or H-SU-Sor groups compared with Norm. The H-Su-Sor rats showed significant reductions in PAP (56%), RVP (55%), and RV hypertrophy (52%). Gene expression profiling data were compared with Norm using GCRMA normalization in R and SAM (> .639, MFC > 1.7). With false discovery rates (FDRs) of 5.1% and 0.7%, respectively, 356 and 293 genes were up- or down-regulated. Forty-seven of the 356 H genes were recapitulated from previous H studies in the rodent model. In addition, 45 genes were differentially expressed between H-Su and H-Su-Sor (FDR 12%), with ECM, cytoskeleton, and angiogenesis gene ontologies, and 81 genes were changed in the H and H-Su groups but not in the H-Su-Sor group. These studies suggest Sor as a powerful novel treatment in PH.",2007,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ankit A.

98b3184c60b3be0b310d8a78a94719760d4fd9a4,Factor Analysis for Multiple Testing (FAMT): An R Package for Large-Scale Significance Testing under Dependence,"The R package FAMT (factor analysis for multiple testing) provides a powerful method for large-scale significance testing under dependence. It is especially designed to select differentially expressed genes in microarray data when the correlation structure among gene expressions is strong. Indeed, this method reduces the negative impact of dependence on the multiple testing procedures by modeling the common information shared by all the variables using a factor analysis structure. New test statistics for general linear contrasts are deduced, taking advantage of the common factor structure to reduce correlation and consequently the variance of error rates. Thus, the FAMT method shows improvements with respect to most of the usual methods regarding the non discovery rate and the control of the false discovery rate (FDR). The steps of this procedure, each of them corresponding to R functions, are illustrated in this paper by two microarray data analyses. We first present how to import the gene ex- pression data, the covariates and gene annotations. The second step includes the choice of the optimal number of factors, the factor model fitting, and provides a list of selected genes according to a preset FDR control level. Finally, diagnostic plots are provided to help the user interpret the factors using available external information on either genes or arrays.",2011,Computer Science,"list(name = ""David Causeur"", ids = ""2234785""); list(name = ""ChloÃ© Friguet"", ids = ""2545540""); list(name = ""Magalie HouÃ©e-Bigot"", ids = ""1402336384""); list(name = ""Maela Kloareg"", ids = ""10748702"")",9dba9654165f306c652ce82e61003d3c74b9bb15; 2a358473e13767bfb99642c5d19054dbdf2cbd4c; c9ac002f079c86da24d3f3ba842d36b4b840b517; 86007b78b5b3ed7ab7f982ed3e6d80b12a44cc08; cd1b1b2616ba4d5b3f6f68dd4c9f2ba343877955; bcf15c2c260517184b73321727f287fe0be92ebd; 70f46efa761b2acda257e9675794e843c8dd48d9; 9a299691bb24a9f23443a4bc1e87c9ac25fe4f95; d3fbc69e2b7ed7d184bb1b6ffbb5ea370319816e; 441b455fd80383732924205d53621cad6879cb3c; 6f548518ad200cbbf0b30d0a3af6e6d28dc5c98f; 292b5ccb390e53de3ede7b7efc484ec5e92fcde9; 37814d8c14b8eeefac7a8e5f998957ec5a7946fa; 963536bf9f586569e75888c0363ced3df4750b8b; 128ffa81cd4b020e1a4aafacd77d6025545c189d,14b741a091d7eae2a7b1c27281a9e4417a587f08; 44ad82804c2acab9e305de3933a78c59108de02c; 840c0cdb1f428d300cd7986d170da5f807b3d20d,Journal of Statistical Software,40,1-19
a3973585e9a76355ba70482a72beccb034a06e55,Transcriptome profile of liver at different physiological stages reveals potential mode for lipid metabolism in laying hens,"BackgroundLiver is an important metabolic organ that plays a critical role in lipid synthesis, degradation, and transport; however, the molecular regulatory mechanisms of lipid metabolism remain unclear in chicken. In this study, RNA-Seq technology was used to investigate differences in expression profiles of hepatic lipid metabolism-related genes and associated pathways between juvenile and laying hens. The study aimed to broaden the understanding of liver lipid metabolism in chicken, and thereby to help improve laying performance in the poultry industry.ResultsRNA-Seq analysis was carried out on total RNA harvested from the liver of juvenile (nâ€‰=â€‰3) and laying (nâ€‰=â€‰3) hens. Compared with juvenile hens, 2567 differentially expressed genes (1082 up-regulated and 1485 down-regulated) with Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05 were obtained in laying hens, and 960 of these genes were significantly differentially expressed (SDE) at a false discovery rate (FDR) of â‰¤0.05 and fold-change â‰¥2 or â‰¤0.5. In addition, most of the 198 SDE novel genes (91 up-regulated and 107 down-regulated) were discovered highly expressed, and 332 SDE isoforms were identified. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis showed that the SDE genes were most enrichment in steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, glycerophospholipid metabolism, three amino acid pathways, and pyruvate metabolism (Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05). The top significantly enriched GO terms among the SDE genes included lipid biosynthesis, cholesterol and sterol metabolic, and oxidation reduction, indicating that principal lipogenesis occurred in the liver of laying hens.ConclusionsThis study suggests that the majority of changes at the transcriptome level in laying hen liver were closely related to fat metabolism. Some of the SDE uncharacterized novel genes and alternative splicing isoforms that were detected might also take part in lipid metabolism, although this needs further investigation. This study provides valuable information about the expression profiles of mRNAs from chicken liver, and in-depth functional investigations of these mRNAs could provide new insights into the molecular networks of lipid metabolism in chicken liver.",2015,Medicine;

6f9fbf9c6949655966694de23189f6e9580fe154,The circulating cell-free microRNA profile in systemic sclerosis is distinct from both healthy controls and systemic lupus erythematosus.,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the expression profile of cell-free circulating microRNA (miRNA) in systemic sclerosis (SSc), healthy controls (HC), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).


METHODS
Total RNA was purified from plasma and 45 different, mature miRNA were measured using quantitative PCR assays after reverse transcription. Samples (n = 189) were from patients with SSc (n = 120), SLE (n = 29), and from HC (n = 40). Expression data were clustered by principal components analysis, and diagnostically specific miRNA profiles were developed by leave-one-out cross-validation. Diagnostic probability scores were derived from stepwise logistic regression.


RESULTS
Thirty-seven miRNA specificities were consistently detected and 26 of these were unaffected by SSc sample age and present in more than two-thirds of SSc samples. SSc cases showed a distinct expression profile with 14/26 miRNA significantly decreased (false discovery rate < 0.05) and 5/26 increased compared with HC. A 21-miRNA classifier gave optimum accuracy (80%) for discriminating SSc from both HC and SLE. The discrimination between HC and SSc (95% accuracy) was strongly driven by miRNA of the 17 âˆ¼ 92 cluster and by miR-16, -223, and -638, while SLE and SSc differed mainly in the expression of miR-142-3p, -150, -223, and -638. Except for a weak correlation between anti-Scl-70 and miR-638 (p = 0.048), there were no correlations with other patient variables.


CONCLUSION
Circulating miRNA profiles are characteristic for SSc compared with both HC and SLE cases. Some of the predicted targets of the differentially regulated miRNA are of relevance for transforming growth factor-Î² signaling and fibrosis, but need to be validated in independent studies.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Samantha O Steen"", ids = ""13479595""); list(name = ""Line V.

ed6606260eb60c87edf1044c3e1c2b06c0afd5d4,Model-free Knockoffs for SLOPE-Adaptive Variable Selection with Controlled False Discovery Rate,"Automatic selection of true explanatory variables and controlling fraction of false discovery rate (FDR) in the linear model has received considerable attention in machine learning. The ordered regularization is an important component of the linear model and plays a key role in solving such kind of problems. Although there have been some models proposed for determining relevant features in either low-dimensional or high-dimensional space. However, there exists no single sorted model that can work in both low-high dimensions cases. This paper introduces a model called mSLOPE (model-free SLOPE) which is a mixed methodology based on model-free (MF) knockoffs and sorted Lone penalized estimation (SLOPE). mSLOPE uses original design matrix augmented with MF knockoffs matrix. The original feature matrix and MF matrix have the same covariance structure. Advantages of mSLOPE include, (i) it identifies true regressors in any dimension, (ii) it is an adaptive and computationally tractable and (iii) it gains power relative to its competitors through an exact control of FDR in any dimensions. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data show that mSLOPE gains superior power and accurate FDR control than state-of-the-art baselines.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Mahammad Humayoo"", ids = ""1952224""); list(name = ""Xueqi Cheng"", ids = ""1717004"")",,0baa7d9071f95ca44e1945c70824b6a9ba8197fb; 1b60c4fddb8ab5475bc3295a2d0af4b1167bc444; da7aa28043f1eda548499a39d241390df4d02a68; be7ee0f1ca3407f824da25c5efb92b63f0fb0482; 363e01562b436aec2e6993b5881b5d6ea0139026; 48d36579b83470650967b0c903e6af005ec10685; 6cc823346a2065bfd26c99a5c4dea1d142c08f1d; 57cca95fdbd35ba1b283c9c6ec5ae7a81be7adfd; c6f27a11554d873060222aed9b2952a3be502db0; a32c1089581ad7acf69576e52ce1b388192542f9; c5362efa2dd2688e06da952e4efbfd4d8702bd13; 0e40441cebb03fa4df6fad43ef5ff592e34c479b; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 3fc17a36e2bec28396fd17c1ec2288d817564565; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; 49f4143eb35926b031df823eeed0458ed40e2f40; bd1233f3707a76684f8801741de78b4bf879f643; f28206bd6e70e3ffdcdc3d73120939abecd50a03; 280627313326fd05d26dcce6f1a905c89d47669b; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac,2018 24th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR),,302-307
f58eb3843e21b6c453c9f85b013da0268bb33c54,Robust Regression Analysis of Copy Number Variation Data based on a Univariate Score,"MOTIVATION
The discovery that copy number variants (CNVs) are widespread in the human genome has motivated development of numerous algorithms that attempt to detect CNVs from intensity data. However, all approaches are plagued by high false discovery rates. Further, because CNVs are characterized by two dimensions (length and intensity) it is unclear how to order called CNVs to prioritize experimental validation.


RESULTS
We developed a univariate score that correlates with the likelihood that a CNV is true. This score can be used to order CNV calls in such a way that calls having larger scores are more likely to overlap a true CNV. We developed cnv.beast, a computationally efficient algorithm for calling CNVs that uses robust backward elimination regression to keep CNV calls with scores that exceed a user-defined threshold. Using an independent dataset that was measured using a different platform, we validated our score and showed that our approach performed better than six other currently-available methods.

6c51eae69b9cae6c934888905ddaf4bc86147b86,Dopamine polymorphisms and depressive symptoms predict foods intake. Results from a nationally representative sample,"Depression and variation in dopamine related genes have both independently been associated with food consumption. Depressive symptoms could synergistically interact with genetic variation to influence food intake. We examined the interaction between high depressive symptoms and functional polymorphisms of dopamine transporter (SLC6A3), monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) and dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) on intake of high-calorie sweet, high-calorie non-sweet, and low-calorie foods in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to examine main effects of gene and depression symptoms and their interaction (genotype-by-high depression symptoms) on food categories. Applying a false discovery rate criterion for multiple comparisons indicated a statistically significant interaction for females with high depressive symptoms and the SLC6A3 gene, such that those with the SLC6A3 10/10 allele reported greater intake of high-calorie sweet foods than their counterparts high in depressive symptoms with the SLC6A3 any 9 allele (LS mean 10/10 allele=2.5, SE=.13; LS mean any 9 allele=1.8, SE=.13, p<.05). These findings highlight that the relationship between depression and food intake may vary as a function of genetic polymorphism.

793ae57d901dad17bd412a0d0c9b76f0f4237d65,Exploring the potential benefits of stratified false discovery rates for region-based testing of association with rare genetic variation,"When analyzing the data that arises from exome or whole-genome sequencing studies, window-based tests, (i.e., tests that jointly analyze all genetic data in a small genomic region), are very popular. However, power is known to be quite low for finding associations with phenotypes using these tests, and therefore a variety of analytic strategies may be employed to potentially improve power. Using sequencing data of all of chromosome 3 from an interim release of data on 2432 individuals from the UK10K project, we simulated phenotypes associated with rare genetic variation, and used the results to explore the window-based test power. We asked two specific questions: firstly, whether there could be substantial benefits associated with incorporating information from external annotation on the genetic variants, and secondly whether the false discovery rate (FDRs) would be a useful metric for assessing significance. Although, as expected, there are benefits to using additional information (such as annotation) when it is associated with causality, we confirmed the general pattern of low sensitivity and power for window-based tests. For our chosen example, even when power is high to detect some of the associations, many of the regions containing causal variants are not detectable, despite using lax significance thresholds and optimal analytic methods. Furthermore, our estimated FDR values tended to be much smaller than the true FDRs. Long-range correlations between variants-due to linkage disequilibrium-likely explain some of this bias. A more sophisticated approach to using the annotation information may improve power, however, many causal variants of realistic effect sizes may simply be undetectable, at least with this sample size. Perhaps annotation information could assist in distinguishing windows containing causal variants from windows that are merely correlated with causal variants.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Changjiang Xu"", ids = ""46747912""); list(name = ""Antonio Ciampi"", ids = ""145498943""); list(name = ""Celia M.

b5e2a6968cd81096997b818d36e1e03257aaa4d2,Rich RNA Structure Landscapes Revealed by Mutate-and-Map Analysis,"Landscapes exhibiting multiple secondary structures arise in natural RNA molecules that modulate gene expression, protein synthesis, and viral infection [corrected]. We report herein that high-throughput chemical experiments can isolate an RNA's multiple alternative secondary structures as they are stabilized by systematic mutagenesis (mutate-and-map, M2) and that a computational algorithm, REEFFIT, enables unbiased reconstruction of these states' structures and populations. In an in silico benchmark on non-coding RNAs with complex landscapes, M2-REEFFIT recovers 95% of RNA helices present with at least 25% population while maintaining a low false discovery rate (10%) and conservative error estimates. In experimental benchmarks, M2-REEFFIT recovers the structure landscapes of a 35-nt MedLoop hairpin, a 110-nt 16S rRNA four-way junction with an excited state, a 25-nt bistable hairpin, and a 112-nt three-state adenine riboswitch with its expression platform, molecules whose characterization previously required expert mutational analysis and specialized NMR or chemical mapping experiments. With this validation, M2-REEFFIT enabled tests of whether artificial RNA sequences might exhibit complex landscapes in the absence of explicit design. An artificial flavin mononucleotide riboswitch and a randomly generated RNA sequence are found to interconvert between three or more states, including structures for which there was no design, but that could be stabilized through mutations. These results highlight the likely pervasiveness of rich landscapes with multiple secondary structures in both natural and artificial RNAs and demonstrate an automated chemical/computational route for their empirical characterization.",2015,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Pablo Cordero"", ids = ""144038779""); list(name = ""Rhiju Das"", ids = ""144120731"")",bfcc71014c426902b3e1a9ceadcfae91b1af69c7; f3696e82386627ecf75f8f3b5c9db35a68242ff6; 395d5148f3fa8d9e6106c8cb8c95b1adc5d426ee; 62bc07c8c50c0913d1622b9881217275eac54f02; ae03651ebf96b3fc29262dbddadecef86447115d; 8bb88c0f2c59f88ed7aeda46f80d4e57c9625ad6; 4fee5fe700a6721f5ee9e7c65d50e3c711801751; 3e4a80d5daec6aeaa6d59f0c7f3c56b5c9b44f4b; c881965f0d44566794144ec3d6b34f9f4c6e968e; 0f271cd5e870acfed07958150d6db8b7c4802a20; 23096c313bb34815746d70537a769a939b65f0e2; 9133446c3d872638c9e764e2fec898201d06194b; 0bec3ba7d7541b055b86720ab7a147890cf48398; 42605969dd8ad77d8fbd6c003ef51569b093115c; 79fe76dfc1a343fca79def807f7e92a74f1f0f5a; 80b79aae7e6e367a36150c67e027547bcec1b3aa; 2faaa28ee834905e6eb6a9b53a11114b2781183a; 786d771c10557998864f147291c4e2291b505931; a35b8fb31c26fa462c1a84e7db96ad63d8759fd5; 7fb9098e45ea983b46df7491c2bc87b7da4b33c2; 8ae26412f38830d95af3a39194247bb4803bf7ba; 284be5240ad10ba12bace4f8b554d29aee5162d3,a397933f32a5ffc6b42ddeb19a6638ef27432951; c8f1d738b591197da0dbd55cf1ff9afdda047b64; 3b22c676a50e46a5992e6328a98ee80998041f09; a8f766e0923c999e459e339935b3455dd2ae483c; 953e53f8da1bddda7e4ef497f7f2f698a75ec5f6; 28a71d12492a51c84d8507e3e6f0220f46812ca1; 7eaeb1c9be04921786613fdb48adc4a0b0899aa2; 5e5da67d9aea3fc97e403a2a7fac4da2382c6716; c47e323b3b7ec90466dbbcadc2438b54759b5ab5; a663002cd3f1ca00e3d10c81ccb3a7f29b8fecfd; 59776f3e62b3c2b5cc7b3191c8e42f9cd659a40e; 165ffca8eaf88d40e76d0df8f7a9481e7cef75d4; 3c2c048d9987a0ce83868b3a37df65a0c0c4a123; 45ee407cc804b9e84098ca36fe1d409785a9524c; 48ca3babc1bd11dbc1e41cf55a3e9b011d6bda3d; 6a2d8925cec506fa977b062117368cfd91ce1ecd; 863b0646729d2cec77184fd8a55b36a7a7c14f4e; cf39a6885a4e25a9880512e04f7b4689abc995e8; 128abf4236d7af6a9243594426226cd617cb0cb8; 121363775d55d4b0ae4483bf9c9299a8109afe86; fc8d0f6c72cf0bbe4d039e4a0f65a2825d1189f8; e9fa964f4aa92ee08080efb21cdacccdb3c5bc86; 09ef86868035bbfd4803a9e1c98640804bf8f4a4; d94093767e82ea91452e5d6fc263d4f8849eeca5; 1889e9f39f76abf8a64b9d6a8167b04f9f790115; 7cbc6ccb2d14962402f389e03f69925e5328b578; dbabbf0525ebae004cedd1d77049201bd22ec3c6; 3fef79c7f0bf079863457e9e2ab86dac54058534; 8deebef46e3406282d2a6459d04198409f4483d5; 7596ff1a0c79a6c00731ca002814b7d88965ae1d; e1fd61ef252a74639de1524553e71a7c9ae39829; aad435cbb84d6eb5228d7529df5a66448455f4e5; bfd4644c85fa6f8e58471168deff836d5ee69ac9; 5e9222ee44916c976c80f11303002e850de0c63e; ee4be359141e4b8a7d199b2aae1d25fdf00a6c16; 22a427bb01c10c766ea790373e6f3aeab65ff18c; 57499df833a1c16fde619d62a1dfc2b474923422; 59fb6f40de30c8a425b96317ed2169c2c5b6b2c4; 06cc0bdf3dbe142b53610196fbfb171e47e69bed; ac31e5c4074c249f9c369a78b87083413c96258e; d5d4efc48424b32a851b2835a8f87275cb0e9223; d254563a9329337037ac2c038f7679c8d9f161ce; c105b90e97866428c84b6298e827ca155c3f0753; 1d26dfb3bb59feb89a76dfb342bba0f2ec391a12; 503f6bbdd04708b3802ebb3bfdcfb43eca33ec4d; 72dac8633ad53e0d043e9da46b3017bfa6901fb4; d86bd29252c5f6079bacc20e340e16252fc38ecb; f44e4fe385aefeb1e655253853f04f89d5acfec4; d918c80db240f91a649e7f021cab168fe5ef672b; 6bc990bb56187c29d306ea8de5dc615884cbb2c3; 3b24f9ebfddd4fb5c8f87085550555588bf6a1b6; e2aaa2e3edb1c8f8263d17dc3de7b7c3a99823b2,PLoS Computational Biology,11,
db503f79ab0b69c3b5b7cf6f1d65ba8a6f18eeec,Autoantibody Signature in Cardiac Arrest.,"Background: Cardiac arrest is a tragic event that causes one death roughly every 90 seconds worldwide. Survivors generally undergo a work-up to identify the etiology of arrest. However, 5-10% of cardiac arrest remain unexplained. As cardiac arrhythmias mostly underlie cardiac arrest and increasing evidence strongly supports the involvement of autoantibodies in arrhythmogenesis, a large-panel autoantibody screening was performed in cardiac arrest patients. Methods: This is an observational, cross-sectional study of patients from the Montreal Heart Institute (MHI) hospital cohort, a single center registry of participants. A peptide microarray was designed to screen for IgG targeting epitopes from all known cardiac ion channels with extracellular domains. Plasma samples from 23 patients with unexplained cardiac arrest were compared to 22 cardiac arrest cases of ischemic origin and a group of 29 age-, sex- and BMI-matched healthy subjects. The false discovery rate (FDR), LASSO logistic regression and random forest methods were jointly carried out to find significant differential IgG responses. Results: The autoantibody against the pore domain of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (Cav1.2) was consistently identified as a biomarker of idiopathic cardiac arrest (P=0.002, FDR=0.007, classification accuracies â‰¥0.83). Functional studies on human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes demonstrated that the anti-Cav1.2 IgG purified from patients with idiopathic cardiac arrest is proarrhythmogenic by reducing the action potential duration through calcium channel inhibition. Conclusions: The present report addresses the concept of autoimmunity and cardiac arrest. Hitherto unknown autoantibodies targeting extracellular sequences of cardiac ion channels were detected. Moreover, the study identified an autoantibody signature specific to patients with cardiac arrest.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ange Maguy"", ids = ""4829220""); list(name = ""Jean-Claude Tardif"", ids = ""143959656""); list(name = ""David Busseuil"", ids = ""3959461""); list(name = ""Camillo Ribi"", ids = ""49171987""); list(name = ""Jun Li"", ids = ""46275557"")",,,Circulation,,
a8590f525ecd83500c8705ebb7f39c85e40df315,Universitet RNA 3 D modules in genome-wide predictions of RNA 2 D structure,"Recent experimental and computational progress has revealed a large potential for RNA structure in the genome. This has been driven by computational strategies that exploit multiple genomes of related organisms to identify common sequences and secondary structures. However, these computational approaches have two main challenges: they are computationally expensive and they have a relatively high false discovery rate (FDR). Simultaneously, RNA 3D structure analysis has revealed modules composed of non-canonical base pairs which occur in non-homologous positions, apparently by independent evolution. These modules can, for example, occur inside structural elements which in RNA 2D predictions appear as internal loops. Hence one question is if the use of such RNA 3D information can improve the prediction accuracy of RNA secondary structure at a genome-wide level. Here, we use RNAz in combination with 3D module prediction tools and apply them on a 13-way vertebrate sequence-based alignment. We find that RNA 3Dmodules predicted by metaRNAmodules and JAR3D are significantly enriched in the screened windows compared to their shuffled counterparts. The initially estimated FDR of 47.0% is lowered to below 25% when certain 3D module predictions are present in the window of the 2D prediction. We discuss the implications and prospects for further development of computational strategies for detection of RNA 2D structure in genomic sequence.",2015,,"list(name = ""Corinna Theis"", ids = ""2233561""); list(name = ""Craig L.

4c40c3d3c4d4668443dca1885bb38cb6674b4b66,Association genetics and expression patterns of a CBF4 homolog in Populus under abiotic stress,"New strategies for prevention and treatment of abiotic stress require an improved understanding of stress responses. Here, we examined response differences of a C-repeat binding factor gene (PsCBF4) between five species in the genus Populus. We also used a candidate gene-based approach to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within PsCBF4 that were associated with physiological and biochemical traits in a natural population (528 unrelated individuals) of Populussimonii. We first isolated a 1,044-bp PsCBF4 cDNA encoding a polypeptide of 256 amino acids. Expression profiling revealed that CBF4 is differentially expressed under cold, heat, drought, and salt conditions among five Populus species. Cold stress is the most significant interspecific difference, and PsCBF4 transcript levels ranged from 6.5 to 379.5 times higher than in unstressed controls. A natural population of P. simonii showed high nucleotide diversity (Ï€TÂ =Â 0.00880, Î¸wÂ =Â 0.01192) and low linkage disequilibrium (r2Â â‰¥Â 0.1, within 700Â bp) across PsCBF4. Association analysis showed that nine SNPs (false discovery rate QÂ <Â 0.10) and two haplotypes (QÂ <Â 0.10) were significantly associated with six physiological and biochemical traits, with each marker explaining 3.36â€“6.12Â % of the phenotypic variance in the corresponding trait. Transcript analysis further detected significant differences among genotypic classes for all significant SNPs.

94f61f2c9eaff4c9ce279d12be83c9f7b0583ed1,Potential role of effector memory T cells in chronic T cell-mediated kidney graft rejection.,"BACKGROUND
Chronic T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) in kidney graft is characterized by reduction of the vessel lumen with marked intimal thickening, fibrous hyperplasia of the small renal arteries and leukocyte infiltrates. The aim of this study was to find specific gene expression profiles in chronic TCMR kidney biopsies.


METHODS
RNA extracted from archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded renal biopsies was used for gene expression profiling. Our study included 14 patients with chronic TCMR and 10 with acute TCMR. Fifty-two cadaveric donors were used as controls. The results were validated in an independent set of kidney biopsies.


RESULTS
We identified 616 and 243 differentially expressed genes with a fold change â‰¥1.5 and a false discovery rate <0.05 in chronic and acute TCMR, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed upregulation of OX40 signalling. This pathway is involved in the generation of CD8+ effector memory T cells and the upregulation of killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG-1), B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP-1) and CD25, which characterize CD8+ effector memory T cells. However, the enhanced OX40 signalling pathway was specific to chronic TCMR; a significant increase of KLRG-1+/CD8+ and BLIMP-1+/CD8+ was only detected in these specimens.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest the involvement of memory-committed CD8+ effector T cells in chronic TCMR. The generation of effector memory T cells is mediated by the OX40 gene pathway, and could be considered a future target for the specific treatment of chronic TCMR.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Claudia Curci"", ids = ""5484735""); list(name = ""Fabio Sallustio"", ids = ""21819445""); list(name = ""Grazia Serino"", ids = ""50149747""); list(name = ""Giuseppe De Palma"", ids = ""50447954""); list(name = ""Mirko Trpevski"", ids = ""1394412112""); list(name = ""Marco Fiorentino"", ids = ""2174622""); list(name = ""Michele Rossini"", ids = ""145298021""); list(name = ""Marco Quaglia"", ids = ""152357015""); list(name = ""Marialuisa Valente"", ids = ""145884400""); list(name = ""Lucrezia Furian"", ids = ""5489432""); list(name = ""Alessia Toscano"", ids = ""34284977""); list(name = ""Gianna Mazzucco"", ids = ""81785150""); list(name = ""Antonella Barreca"", ids = ""152826215""); list(name = ""Stefania Bussolino"", ids = ""47367161""); list(name = ""Loreto Gesualdo"", ids = ""49199439""); list(name = ""Piero Stratta"", ids = ""4281948""); list(name = ""Paolo Rigotti"", ids = ""39411906""); list(name = ""Franco Citterio"", ids = ""4018933""); list(name = ""Luigi Biancone"", ids = ""144005415""); list(name = ""Francesco P.

We describe FFselect (https://github.com/NicholSchultz/FFselect), a novel method that both builds upon recent advances and further extends the linear mixed model for genome-wide association analysis to allow modeling of shared environmental effects.

The aim of this study was to investigate C. thermocellum genes required to ferment biomass substrates and to conduct a robust comparison of DNA microarray and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analytical platforms.ResultsC. thermocellum ATCC 27405 fermentations were conducted with a 5Â g/L solid substrate loading of either pretreated switchgrass or Populus. Quantitative saccharification and inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-ES) for elemental analysis revealed composition differences between biomass substrates, which may have influenced growth and transcriptomic profiles. High quality RNA was prepared for C. thermocellum grown on solid substrates and transcriptome profiles were obtained for two time points during active growth (12Â hours and 37Â hours postinoculation). A comparison of two transcriptomic analytical techniques, microarray and RNA-seq, was performed and the data analyzed for statistical significance. Large expression differences for cellulosomal genes were not observed. We updated gene predictions for the strain and a small novel gene, Cthe_3383, with a putative AgrD peptide quorum sensing function was among the most highly expressed genes. RNA-seq data also supported different small regulatory RNA predictions over others. The DNA microarray gave a greater number (2,351) of significant genes relative to RNA-seq (280 genes when normalized by the kernel density mean of M component (KDMM) method) in an analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing method with a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). When a 2-fold difference in expression threshold was applied, 73 genes were significantly differentially expressed in common between the two techniques. Sulfate and phosphate uptake/utilization genes, along with genes for a putative efflux pump system were some of the most differentially regulated transcripts when profiles for C. thermocellum grown on either pretreated switchgrass or Populus were compared.ConclusionsOur results suggest that a high degree of agreement in differential gene expression measurements between transcriptomic platforms is possible, but choosing an appropriate normalization regime is essential.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Charlotte M.

We aimed to identify the key genes, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved with HCC. We obtained mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA profiles for HCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas and then identified differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and lncRNAs (DElncRNAs). We performed functional annotation of DEmRNAs and then constructed HCC-specific DEmiRNA-DEmRNA, DEmiRNA-DElncRNA and DElncRNA-DEmiRNA-DEmRNA interaction networks. We searched for nearby target cis-DEmRNAs of DElncRNAs and performed receiver operating characteristic and survival analyses. A total of 1239 DEmRNAs, 33 DEmiRNAs and 167 DElncRNAs in HCC were obtained. Retinol metabolism [false discovery rate (FDR)Â =Â 7.02Â Ã— 10-14] and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 (FDRÂ =Â 7.30Â Ã— 10-11) were two significantly enriched pathways in HCC. We obtained 545 DEmiRNA-DEmRNA pairs that consisted of 258 DEmRNAs and 28 DEmiRNAs in HCC. mir-424, miR-93 and miR-3607 are three hub DEmiRNAs of the HCC-specific DEmiRNA-DEmRNA interaction network. HAND2-AS1/ENSG00000232855-miR-93-LRAT/RND3, ENSG00000232855-miR-877-RCAN1 and ENSG00000232855-miR-224-RND3 interactions were found in the HCC-specific DElncRNA-DEmiRNA-DEmRNA interaction network. A total of three DElncRNA-nearby target DEmRNA pairs (HCG25-KIFC1, LOC105378687-CDC20 and LOC101927043-EPCAM) in HCC were obtained. Diagnostic and prognostic values of several selected DElncRNAs, DEmRNAs and DEmiRNAs for HCC were assessed. Our study identified several DEmRNAs, DEmiRNAs and DElncRNAs with great diagnostic or prognostic value for HCC, which may facilitate studies into the molecular mechanisms, and development of potential biomarkers and therapeutic target sites for HCC.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Baoqi Shi"", ids = ""7815500""); list(name = ""Xiang Yang Zhang"", ids = ""46447209""); list(name = ""Lumeng Chao"", ids = ""51235606""); list(name = ""Yu Zheng"", ids = ""145143274""); list(name = ""Yongsheng Tan"", ids = ""9200334""); list(name = ""Liang Wei Wang"", ids = ""48169897""); list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""49039655"")",3724baad321f5d24187baf624b94cd2b9789f743; c785120a161b9aa9ea69ef9b670c40e43b1c7efc; 6325ec4bcdced4cae7b8d9db83cf13033a17daf8,aa669a836d44443e70f485c08424d8222f60140e; d803086cfb30bc9f67d0dbc474f132eea2b61684; 8c41c7c0cf0f4e1d4a100b17174ff9eef1c38bfc; b9dc4957e64cf9fc36ba3b1b581f5cf422516f7c; 6b5d38786ffc3abf1255fc8590e1636790d047a5; 87aa17e4dbd4b9dd33d489fe25f48f9611368cbe; bdb817d7f54c91ed7e08793e02d527f683e70d7a; 465ee7f58cfcc4420fdf7c78eb0e9d9827362dd9; cc989bb1c4a131ce190180b8b3e330d1018fd7fa; 8846cab0017890554aac2202c25423ae983e9cf0; 14ce815c23ea00efa668524e6a738c06317ba373; 757ec3db5fa8265862a666206c9c16929913f1b2; 94c9c98df02e85f8cca8e0d6e85ff43d720a6aca; edaaaca13a6a04cc5696378c768bc688330c1b3e; 87ccc438b0c73fcfdea48485fcdb091a8ecaa89c; 9a132bd597ccf9e82055ce1cb100e1a28c6a2190; df52db69bd6ebfdeb945eb7b99e88d9055c5a116; 7f9c126107151907afb8cf49445ab3e13e67a69b; bdc010f1f96f3b95a31e8216e57a5101f4150934; 509d296cc7b42816639ef0212d53c6b6dade499e; 9e4a8aeef1ccc53e41d49a4b4a5ae953ed993140; 9e5177c6e4408ee99fd2424960a8d8f6ca365352; d3aa587240ba85a0a8cf5a368bdf5293aef4dea9; c1ca3dc0709a60dacf7279621b3ba84db2d1f5f3; e023ed4be5e640b7f07e334758b029dbec3f1efe; a8d7d455325484cd0c795cdbef7d68264d2094d6; f0e88c3cbea5d3965bdfb04966f5f707b076f0d2; 57ab010431fa894ad839dd6b1dd97a8e84d081b6; df71e84e3876fdb41c03013eaadc07b3d867c811; 7f8473f66993ccf492663bbdfae3f2fba6ea13f0; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 3cac8f1e3026fe41d7cbf7e5903a50a24aaf23a9; 482dd2a9b477f3c6ea445a44d915d4199ab86a42; ce6fd461ab71a8a8885840bf2b2a0438d3956c31; caf0ffe46630f1920c82a410dae0ed8cbeb37024; 40f7ed1f9d9cad214aa1f5e8e063a8ce5e88bdf9; b31bc8eb6ab324a8eac11d4282b09b0ad1f0b49d; 2f3c851447d3b6e2810fc4931fc23bdbefd57521; ff37e7c3611e51656137371c78c4fd912a96f038; b22cd59dbd87782212a8f2bf86a103433b83868d; 5901291d0775feb9ed6d85706d527e8d41f9c6da; 8a0bb73c85ee700e26f0daec1bb218e4d9b1414e; 5d9eb7dc02a2b2cc59d0ed9b9758f8f0b6ce6ce0,FEBS Open Bio,8,1424 - 1436

Increasingly, researchers also wish to prioritize certain hypotheses, for example, those thought to have larger effect sizes, by upweighting, and to impose constraints on the underlying mining, such as monotonicity along a certain sequence. We introduce Princessp, a principled method for performing weighted multiple testing by constrained convex optimization. Our method elegantly allows one to prioritize certain hypotheses through upweighting and to discount others through downweighting, while constraining the underlying weights involved in the mining process. When the Pvalues derive from monotone likelihood ratio families such as the Gaussian means model, the new method allows exact solution of an important optimal weighting problem previously thought to be non-convex and computationally infeasible. Our method scales to massive data set sizes. We illustrate the applications of Princessp on a series of standard genomics data sets and offer comparisons with several previous â€˜standardâ€™ methods. Princessp offers both ease of operation and the ability to scale to extremely large problem sizes.

751585049b131e20cb7d022a99984ceecfaace5d,A Comparative Evaluation of Existing Grading Scales in Intracerebral Hemorrhage,"BackgroundIn recent years, a multitude of clinical grading scales have been created to help identify patients at greater risk of poor outcome following ICH. We sought to validate and compare eight of the most frequently used ICH grading scales in a prospective cohort.MethodsEight grading scales were calculated for 67 patients with non-traumatic ICH enrolled in the prospective intracerebral hemorrhage outcomes project (ICHOP) database. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, including area under the curve (AUC) and maximum Youden Index were used to assess the ability of each score to predict in-hospital mortality, long-term (3Â months) mortality, and functional outcome at 3Â months (mRSÂ â‰¥Â 3).ResultsAll scales demonstrated excellent to outstanding discrimination for in-hospital and long-term mortality, with no significant differences between them after controlling for the false discovery rate. All scales demonstrated acceptable to outstanding discrimination for functional outcome at 3Â months, with the new ICH score demonstrating significantly lower AUC than 6 of the 8 scores. Essen ICH score was the only score to demonstrate outstanding discrimination for each outcome measure.ConclusionThough significant differences were minimal in our cohort, we showed the existing selection of ICH grading scales to be useful in stratifying patients according to risk of mortality and poor functional outcome. Continued validation and comparison in large prospective cohorts will bring the goal of a singular prognostic model for ICH closer to fruition.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Samuel S.

b182e9cff24b0a03676ce950b498c1b3beaa3298,Increased levels of circulating cytokines with HIV-related immunosuppression.,"Cytokines may contribute to the severity of CD4 cell depletion with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but quantitative relationships are not well defined. Serum and plasma from 181 HIV-infected individuals were tested with Millipore 30-plex Luminex cytokine assays. Within-individual correlations among cytokines were summarized by two-dimensional hierarchical cluster analysis. Associations with age, sex, race, CD4 count, and HIV viral load were determined with linear regression models. Tests for statistical significance were corrected for multiple comparisons, using a false discovery rate of 0.1. African-Americans had significantly higher levels than whites of six cytokines (IL-2, IL-5, IL-7, IL-15, fractalkine, and IFN-Î³), and lower levels of MCP-1. Females had higher fractalkine levels than males. Age was not associated with levels of any cytokine. Six cytokines, including the T-helper (Th) type 1 cytokine IL-15, the Th2 cytokines IL-1ra and IL-10, the chemokines fractalkine and MCP-1, and the growth factor G-CSF were each inversely associated with CD4 count; no cytokine was directly associated with CD4 count. Fractalkine was directly associated with HIV viral load, adjusted for CD4 count. Cytokines clustered by primary function (e.g., Th1, Th2, proinflammatory, chemokines, or growth factors) whereas individuals clustered according to cytokine levels (generally high, intermediate, or low) had significantly different CD4 counts [medians (interquartile range) of 60 (17-162), 131 (62-321), and 155 (44-467), respectively; p<0.0001]. CD4 deficiency is associated with generalized increases in cytokines of various functions.

a7ccce42518e93da967ca788ab09eb9a94684453,MiR expression profiles of paired primary colorectal cancer and metastases by next-generation sequencing,"MicroRNAs (miRs) have been recognized as promising biomarkers. It is unknown to what extent tumor-derived miRs are differentially expressed between primary colorectal cancers (pCRCs) and metastatic lesions, and to what extent the expression profiles of tumor tissue differ from the surrounding normal tissue. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 220 fresh-frozen samples, including paired primary and metastatic tumor tissue and non-tumorous tissue from 38 patients, revealed expression of 2245 known unique mature miRs and 515 novel candidate miRs. Unsupervised clustering of miR expression profiles of pCRC tissue with paired metastases did not separate the two entities, whereas unsupervised clustering of miR expression profiles of pCRC with normal colorectal mucosa demonstrated complete separation of the tumor samples from their paired normal mucosa. Two hundred and twenty-two miRs differentiated both pCRC and metastases from normal tissue samples (false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05). The highest expressed tumor-specific miRs were miR-21 and miR-92a, both previously described to be involved in CRC with potential as circulating biomarker for early detection. Only eight miRs, 0.5% of the analysed miR transcriptome, were differentially expressed between pCRC and the corresponding metastases (FDR <0.1), consisting of five known miRs (miR-320b, miR-320d, miR-3117, miR-1246 and miR-663b) and three novel candidate miRs (chr 1-2552-5p, chr 8-20656-5p and chr 10-25333-3p). These results indicate that previously unrecognized candidate miRs expressed in advanced CRC were identified using NGS. In addition, miR expression profiles of pCRC and metastatic lesions are highly comparable and may be of similar predictive value for prognosis or response to treatment in patients with advanced CRC.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Maarten Neerincx"", ids = ""35233701""); list(name = ""Daoud Sie"", ids = ""40102474""); list(name = ""Mark A van de Wiel"", ids = ""2074791""); list(name = ""Nicole C T van Grieken"", ids = ""144449863""); list(name = ""Jacobus Burggraaf"", ids = ""47374257""); list(name = ""Henk Dekker"", ids = ""153613085""); list(name = ""Paul P.

e996ae7bf34dbd967a1d8644b79e0a7cc8325403,Pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling imaging of cerebral blood perfusion asymmetry in drug-naÃ¯ve patients with first-episode major depression,"Many previous studies have reported that regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) aberrations may be one of the pathological characteristics of depression and rCBF has demonstrated a certain degree of asymmetry. However, studies investigating the cerebral blood perfusion asymmetry changes of drug-naÃ¯ve patients experiencing their first episode of major depression using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) are rare. Ten drug-naÃ¯ve patients experiencing their first major depression episode and 15 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the current study. A novel pCASL method was applied to whole brain MRI scans of all of the samples. The Statistics Parameter Mapping and Relative Expression Software Tool software packages were used for the pre-processing and statistical analysis of the two sets of images, and the differences in the cerebral blood perfusion at the whole brain level were compared between the two groups. Compared with the healthy control group, the cerebral perfusion of the depression patients showed an asymmetric pattern. Decreased cerebral blood perfusion regions were primarily located in the left hemisphere, specifically in the left temporal lobe, frontal lobe and cingulate cortex [P<0.05 and cluster size â‰¥30 with false discovery rate (FDR) correction]. Simultaneously, increased perfusion regions were predominantly located in the right hemisphere, specifically in the right cerebellum, thalamus, frontal lobe and anterior cingulate cortex (P<0.05 and cluster size â‰¥30, with FDR correction). Thus, pCASL may characterize the alterations in cerebral blood perfusion of patients with depression.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Guangdong Chen"", ids = ""48390799""); list(name = ""Haiman Bian"", ids = ""5168541""); list(name = ""Deguo Jiang"", ids = ""5974964""); list(name = ""Mingwei Cui"", ids = ""50292840""); list(name = ""Shengzhang Ji"", ids = ""8072715""); list(name = ""Mei Liu"", ids = ""144474427""); list(name = ""Xu Lang"", ids = ""6381791""); list(name = ""Chuanjun Zhuo"", ids = ""1853979"")",69e895a41aea40b28b79ac884028bb0a9fb768da; 8f778bee61b06878495f053e7243f01e6d070c4c; eb432f0d5d403d789a28f23e58220914f43a5e28,41074c4d2bd1ba80231b03e38b18a16ee42960c9; 0a6caf6dab45dd8e1e0ae9e7284a76442ea0e88a; 83271813204b63f9d0e525f8ad17469fa77d9a2f; 3801b5d203a75860eaa02e9686899ceb56e22c8d; e5b8a7b5776d7120c216fe72a8d66448bce0e534; 9fc93f1286c9ddde5ba8629cee1facadb87c69c4; 8f8fe42b73df145ed9095e2ee3e30a51da09d228; f531d666f06ab06420ee73fe5b582b29f8153a5b; 64844833e1f5243bd7f6fa88407fd64c39cfc749; 7eb7250cf7d0f8826cfe90b8377b0ff8851acd85; e10a66b9ef5057f5a3b761cb77d4403b83e6f5db; f4f0b589eddeca74758e4a893969de5520147845; 98018ee0840e3f5f0707f49ee10c1872ef7f3eb6; 5ecfb7538ad2573f8cec1bc96f3d560214586e6d; 2aa149ce96e99c6acdb6345a989975f0ddadd336; a76314bf3f31a618d0360d26d3584c3d2c76e14a; 3f3c76ea67c79f0af9cc5d8bd9ddff8c5f8e4689; aefec0e9417e45086fbd0b2469e5e0a359aa2090; 94863c5375a887ee0e418c0515a089e6775c6d14; 8bc3d4ef76fd9506b8037d7372cdd3ca3906327b; 712ee55eadd221bda5c8526beb153e2514271bb7; 62160cc0b22c641d5af186d2600e7a1abe8ff226; 24beae76c39590a10f1e3560a7fc5aecdbf8f2ea; b292a2f25e64c16d40374236c95475d44a2c0bd1; 85a673b9c4c98a543826b05f4c781f7d254dec2d; e93cfcef27bf7accc6a5121d6eedc09c45ebd284,Biomedical Reports,5,675 - 680
bfee3e09b72b7d8d6913b5ffee53a3c803198ede,Comparing MicroRNA Expression In Aggressive and Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas Identifies a Prognostic Signature for Mantle Cell Lymphoma,"Abstract 800 Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) accounting for ~6% of all NHL. It is sensitive to combination chemotherapy, but remission durations are short without approaches such as stem cell transplantation (SCT). Most patients are incurable, but the clinical course is variable, with some patients succumbing quickly, while others survive >10 years. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by inhibiting mRNA translation. miRs are useful in the prognostic assessment of tumors, but work to date examining differences between MCL and normal lymphoid tissues, have only identified 2 miRs involved in MCL prognosis (Zhao JJ, Blood , 2010; Di Lisio L, Leukemia , 2010). We used a novel approach to identify a prognostic miR signature in MCL. We hypothesized that a miR signature defining aggressiveness can be obtained by comparing miR expression profiles of aggressive NHL with indolent NHL, and that this signature when applied to a set of MCL cases, may aid in MCL prognosis. Total RNA was extracted from 135 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples obtained at primary diagnosis (Table 1). RNA from a training set of 19 indolent and 20 aggressive NHL cases was analyzed on a high-throughput quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) platform assessing the expression of 365 miRs and 3 endogenous controls (TaqMan Human MicroRNA Array v1.0: TLDA, ABI) using the DDCt method. A two-sample Wilcoxon Rank sum test corrected for false discovery rate was used to assess the significance of differential expression for each miR between aggressive and indolent NHL. The 14 most significantly differentially expressed miRs (p et al ., and miR-26a, shown to be important in MCL pathogenesis by Di Lisio et al . In light of the overlap with such recent studies, we believe the 9 miR prognostic signature we have identified may be of clinical utility. We are currently identifying mRNA targets for this miR signature and validating both the signature and the deregulated expression of these targets on a larger set of 200 MCL samples with known outcome data.

e45748631e3b4ada848ca71859eee66fe6f8e0bd,Capreomycin Resistance Prediction in Two Species of Mycobacterium Using a Stacked Ensemble Method.,"AIMS
Predicting bacterial resistance provides valuable information that can assist in clinical decisions. With recent advances in whole genome sequencing technology, the detection of antibiotic resistance (AR) proteins directly from genomic data is becoming feasible. AR genes/proteins can be identified using best-hit methods that work by comparing candidate sequences with known AR genes in public databases. However, these approaches may fail to detect resistance genes with sequences that differ significantly from known sequences. Our goal is to develop a machine learning technique to accurately predict capreomycin resistance in Mycobacteria with low false discovery rates.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We present a stacked ensemble learning model as an alternative to traditional DNA sequence alignment-based methods using optimal features generated from the physicochemical, evolutionary, and secondary structure properties of protein sequences. We train logistic regression, C5.0, and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms as our base classifiers, and our stacked ensemble predictors combine the results from the base classifiers to achieve higher accuracy. Compared with our most accurate base classifier (SVM), our most accurate stacked ensemble predictor increases training accuracy by 2.43%. Our stacked ensemble predictors achieve test accuracy up to 81.25%.


CONCLUSIONS
We developed a stacked ensemble model to predict capreomycin resistance for Mycobacteria with an accuracy greater than 80% using protein sequences with sequence similarity ranging between 10% and 70%. This performance cannot be achieved with best-hit methods due to differences in sequence similarity.


SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY
Today an estimated one-half million cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively-drug resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) occur annually worldwide at a great cost. Because capreomycin is a second-line drug used to treat drug resistant TB, the ability to use a machine learning approach to classify capreomycin-resistant TB in a timely manner is crucial for the successful treatment of MDR or XDR TB.

cacba1516b3bd237a9eec560c89d982b2d186051,Androgen receptor-deficient islet Î²-cells exhibit alteration in genetic markers of insulin secretion and inflammation. A transcriptome analysis in the male mouse.,"AIMS
Testosterone action is mediated via the androgen receptor (AR). We have reported that male mice lacking AR selectively in Î²-cells (Î²ARKO-/y) develop decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), producing glucose intolerance. We showed that testosterone action on AR in Î²-cells amplifies the insulinotropic action of GLP-1 on its receptor via a cAMP-dependent protein kinase-A pathway.


METHODS
To investigate AR-dependent gene networks in Î²-cells, we performed a high throughput whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) in islets from male Î²ARKO-/y and control mice.


RESULTS
We identified 214 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (158 up- and 56 down-regulated) with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and a fold change (FC) > 2. Our analysis of individual transcripts revealed alterations in Î²-cell genes involved in cellular inflammation/stress and insulin secretion. Based on 312 DEGs with an FDR < 0.05, the pathway analysis revealed 23 significantly enriched pathways, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Jak-STAT signaling, insulin signaling, MAPK signaling, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and pancreatic secretion.

8bfe7ac21f56b2d52b5d709168f3e426f89d6978,Susceptibility loci for umbilical hernia in swine detected by genome-wide association,"Umbilical hernia (UH) is a complex disorder caused by both genetic and environmental factors. UH brings animal welfare problems and severe economic loss to the pig industry. Until now, the genetic basis of UH is poorly understood. The high-density 60K porcine SNP array enables the rapid application of genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic loci for phenotypic traits at genome wide scale in pigs. The objective of this research was to identify susceptibility loci for swine umbilical hernia using the GWAS approach. We genotyped 478 piglets from 142 families representing three Western commercial breeds with the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip. Then significant SNPs were detected by GWAS using ROADTRIPS (Robust Association-Detection Test for Related Individuals with Population Substructure)software base on a Bonferroni corrected threshold (P = 1.67E-06) or suggestive threshold (P = 3.34E-05) and false discovery rate (FDR = 0.05). After quality control, 29924 qualified SNPs and 472 piglets were used for GWAS. Two suggestive loci predisposing to pig UH were identified at 44.25MB on SSC2 (rs81358018, P = 3.34E-06, FDR = 0.049933) and at 45.90MB on SSC17 (rs81479278, P = 3.30E-06, FDR = 0.049933) in Duroc population, respectively. And no SNP was detected to be associated with pig UH at significant level in neither Landrace nor Large White population. Furthermore, we carried out a meta-analysis in the combined purebreed population containing all the 472 piglets. rs81479278 (P = 1.16E-06, FDR = 0.022475) was identified to associate with pig UH at genome-wide significant level. SRC was characterized as plausible candidate gene for susceptibility to pig UH according to its genomic position and biological functions. To our knowledge, this study gives the first description of GWAS identifying susceptibility loci for umbilical hernia in pigs. Our findings provide deeper insights to the genetic architecture of umbilical hernia in pigs.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiao Jing Liao"", ids = ""97701853""); list(name = ""Lin Li"", ids = ""21858783""); list(name = ""Zhiyan Zhang"", ids = ""48805548""); list(name = ""Yi Long"", ids = ""50363624""); list(name = ""Bin Yang"", ids = ""49188671""); list(name = ""Guorong Ruan"", ids = ""17837927""); list(name = ""Ying Su"", ids = ""145599795""); list(name = ""Hua-Shui Ai"", ids = ""39468777""); list(name = ""Wanchang Zhang"", ids = ""153645492""); list(name = ""Weiyun Deng"", ids = ""15205726""); list(name = ""Shijun Xiao"", ids = ""46440882""); list(name = ""Jun Ren"", ids = ""145365394""); list(name = ""Nengshui Ding"", ids = ""120662732""); list(name = ""Lusheng Huang"", ids = ""153562917"")",d32fe26aaeaab99c2a809a148eb35cf756de4d3a; 32941a1dce7ae97a75e3bd0f963f63e568907084,c34e2f1d30a929e88d85636c7e21f0a7744e078d; ab9eb7a9df7188f5e9feedc6a39b443d6704d033; a3507a9e7d42c5972bb9edc1ead56c361d7f2589; 7ce05385c728fa07ea564339852bfc781ee7911c; 2ec0a29bd24bfcf8c366dedfbb0389c82669b48c; 491b2a4a9b29c70bb506c9f28514d78f40a7192b; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 7288f19b7e9309b951b7663c5e577abe5d705c89; 24d61fe58bb66b7178be84cd44d052a114ea2aa6; fe4cc7d532df4a741f99879d594722e58777f695; ac1cabe5a354a855e85ffdeba9e15c3841c4b01f; ddafc0b2cacf4009d836f39ea22bac12edd6afbb; 79b9142bf80fac53070d358065b801ee9134e05f; 214b67c3108215362d507de3c3eb698f72eb011f; fbdca0e3d96cb0420301e8c6b28907b857db3d6b; 256245c9bc2b9f8e2e31a65caed97e803ca915a8; 45f5ff6b9ad70e5162998a2e96677587661992aa; f975ac4c94287fff56138c980900353d388d7049; d3cc43a74347ea94fec49b52bfa1c1d8b0c56245; b47c1ecb89a59c1a6da61edc74071488b9e658ad; e83e25358f857415242ca06a224064702c9a62a1; 8c7581d1536c446e8554f155c14abda1b904c042; 4bdcbda6cdd62cfeb159581c9264d184367bb55c; e5ed71d8c1de34f3e3a7e2e8c6e26676f3306367; d2ffae187d5c325a6ca5a70bc7b7cb6b7fa05b7b; 05682c9547710730eda29f5bdfcc3df46a85b474; 7830cd7b80f68bc0349f26d98bd3dc3aecaecea1; be388a3c6f2ddd880eb2dbb06f0e1c6096582b24; d960b3819656e09e1789a0f3666bf01c38d44866; 8787457a49055e95eb21be4fffca03cbef261449; 118d2a6964e3637f42a972796b8bda9406639317; 8e95231c5cfdd1699b98445d0f56e887eed8b5bb; 241d361178a593cd6d0f6f5e9659a7b185a62508; 7bd31155b5577b406fe1ed3380d7394e96e53c87; 2c0659420dffa16f73b79ff8dac9d5844c6b3782; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; b247c518b9b006f9263dca19e5776aeba5377329; 9690f13163a989a3cf08310bd74d7000992f2264; cb2ae53c600bb4412ce47c2d22b74fe31cc14e47; f0a0750409a626fc01fa93b47d4900dc209fc7c9; 003c0d61e1e01445b5fa28c561a6d99743db21b9; 82a674f2d61e45d3ae525529ea8b547b88cc5f1f; 074c47320eed3144e0983ff6738787ed11e9d81b; f15d2bc07a2ffa62c86a6ce2e2eff3e5e27766b0,Russian Journal of Genetics,51,1000-1006
0b71afc28de0392cb9abde29a57cbdc2d1281aa3,Brain networks construction using Bayes FDR and average power function,"Brain functional connectivity is a widely investigated topic in neuroscience. In recent years, the study of brain connectivity has been largely aided by graph theory. The link between time series recorded at multiple locations in the brain and the construction of a graph is usually an adjacency matrix. The latter converts a measure of the connectivity between two time series, typically a correlation coefficient, into a binary choice on whether the two brain locations are functionally connected or not. As a result, the choice of a threshold Ï„ over the correlation coefficient is key. In the present work, we propose a multiple testing approach to the choice of Ï„ that uses the Bayes false discovery rate and a new estimator of the statistical power called average power function to balance the two types of statistical error. We show that the proposed average power function estimator behaves well both in case of independence and weak dependence of the tests and it is reliable under several simulated dependence conditions. Moreover, we propose a robust method for the choice of Ï„ using the 5% and 95% percentiles of the average power function and False Discovery Rate bootstrap distributions, respectively, to improve stability. We applied our approach to functional magnetic resonance imaging and high density electroencephalogram data.",2019,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Piero Quatto"", ids = ""3252353""); list(name = ""NicolÃ² Margaritella"", ids = ""5986533""); list(name = ""Isa Costantini"", ids = ""4649814""); list(name = ""Francesca Baglio"", ids = ""3090270""); list(name = ""Massimo Garegnani"", ids = ""35417372""); list(name = ""Raffaello Nemni"", ids = ""1722058""); list(name = ""Luigi Pugnetti"", ids = ""2767281"")",,fc264e230970f3eed9d17a3def70863526b0b1bc; 81a65f23474ffceb2481836328608102950da979; bc85c2a7df8207afe6cd2cf1306ad957a296ee5a; 51f6d7eb5b1f55ceeedd639faf077ce8a1404819; 07e75f181b9837871ec4b1a48458a9260e17bf2f; 451988d380a4094f39cdb853a3654cccebf97975; 8c5610b0d981a5e03ac546df4dfb43e05e3f13d0; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; 751e72479e408f255636bf4f69df7ad7f5ea29d7; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; c75deae4f847990a0ed92db113928545bfbc39c9; 3c94e1acccab115c474eea62d39ade37eaa55d39; c6b745c7ecc3fc89d0df71727e1a0f456be7187a; 30b0d18936ef862e06836b1715e1c55f024b8a8e; 783331371237b407d2bd86418f56a89ffd677d13; ebbd2cfd1f98d77d7a16db4509c5aaee5ec6f63c; d11f1ac25a813dda546cd2cb7a6cd157afa194dd; 130deaff056f5c8907e8b3bed9eb62be418c53bb; feec8b37445c5e814fdef9cdcd0a5881d442632f; b79209890a19820d734e7616bc16bf06bf32a758; 7db3644447e2857c636be4880f5f8ed77004a9f6; 502cd59e2fed2d5050b2ed21d79bdb1d12167439; 92921cacfc70612e4932cc26b99a4b8e5e64d8e1; 56052b0740f2b6c39c16c22087d7397f1b31a281; 6e6f6c425ea33135158a8b69f54b91fad1de917f; c7d4097ad2820d705bfda63f84c13ef039847972; 6c065bc49fe23b763cc31f75d2429bfc74deeb8e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 7649af7bf6e9d277ed045930fc08d79247e02375; 44d86f3ba9167f4931dae729d814c13fbc7a0efb; f76de26cc9e89c122f8a83f1cda437797486476d; 98bfecc235ca997652adf343e8a1759e3a189a26; b594809c33adc92b75bcb87a941941792c797f7c; 9cd87eb83bc93161b226731116ec105c0a9c7cb5,Statistical Methods in Medical Research,29,866 - 878
97bea7bdaf3c3b57b552e323dbb38b9c5a4f55f9,Effects of pathogenic CNVs on physical traits in participants of the UK Biobank,"Background Copy number variants (CNVs) have been shown to increase risk for physical anomalies, developmental, psychiatric and medical disorders. Some of them have been associated with changes in weight, height, and other physical traits. As most studies have been performed on children and young people, these effects of CNVs in adulthood are not well established. Methods The UK Biobank recruited half a million adults who provided a variety of physical measurements. We called all CNVs from the Affymetrix microarrays and selected a set of 54 CNVs implicated as pathogenic (including their reciprocal deletions/duplications) and that were present in five or more persons. Linear regression analysis was used to establish their association with 16 physical traits, relevant to human health. Results 396,725 participants of white British or Irish descent (excluding first-degree relatives) passed our quality control filters. There were 214 CNV/trait associations significant at a false discovery rate of 0.1, most of them novel. These traits are associated with adverse health outcomes: e.g. increased weight, waist-to-hip ratio, pulse rate and body fat composition. Deletions at 16p11.2, 16p12.1, NRXN1 and duplications at 16p13.11 and 22q11.2 produced the highest numbers of significant associations. CNVs at 1q21.1, 2q13, 16p11.2, 16p11.2 distal, 16p12.1, 17p12 and 17q12 demonstrated one or more mirror image effects of deletions versus duplications. Conclusions Carriers of many CNVs should be monitored for physical traits that increase morbidity and mortality.

35689ec5bcc013854d3d34aebbad7341e6a0d31d,Genome-wide association mapping and examination of possible maternal effect for the pace trait of horses.,"Previously, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) related to gait type was identified at position 22Â 999Â 655 of chromosome 23 in the coding region of DMRT3 (DMRT3:Ser301Ter) by showing that a cytosine (C) to adenine (A) mutation of this SNP induced pace in the Icelandic horse. We investigated the effect of DMRT3:Ser301Ter on the gait of Hokkaido Native Horses, a Japanese native breed, and examined genetic factors other than DMRT3 by exploring genome-wide SNPs related to gait determination. All animals exhibiting pace were AA for DMRT3:Ser301Ter, confirming the association of DMRT3:Ser301Ter with gait determination; however, 14.3% of the animals exhibiting trot also had AA for DMRT3:Ser301Ter, suggesting the presence of another factor(s) cooperatively working with DMRT3:Ser301Ter for gait determination. SNPs on chromosomes 13 and 23 were detected by genome-wide association analysis (false discovery rate <0.05), although SNPs on chromosome 23 were all located in the vicinity of DMRT3:Ser301Ter, confirming the association with DMRT3. A genome-wide association study targeting only animals with AA for DMRT3:Ser301Ter to examine genetic factors cooperatively working with DMRT3:Ser301Ter for gait determination suggested associations of 23 SNPs on six chromosomes. In a series of analyses of the effect of a maternal factor (dam's gait) on gait determination, the effect was suggested in comparison of the frequencies of exhibiting pace in gait checks in only two animal groups having dams with different DMRT3:Ser301Ter genotypes (PÂ <Â 0.05), suggesting that the gait of the dam does not have a major effect on whether progeny homozygous for the DMRT3:Ser301Ter mutation will preferentially pace or trot.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tomoko Amano"", ids = ""35530343""); list(name = ""Akio Onogi"", ids = ""3055537""); list(name = ""Fuminori Yamada"", ids = ""46996500""); list(name = ""Mieko Kawai"", ids = ""12382383""); list(name = ""Kouichi Shirai"", ids = ""32809936""); list(name = ""Junnya Ueda"", ids = ""90701173"")",,,Animal genetics,49 5,"

d009cda74ba50fdf59a44885a9a1b212d7f7a54b,Gut microbiome in early pediatric multiple sclerosis: a case-control study (P4.027),"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Alterations in the gut microbiome may be influential in neurological disease. We explored gut microbiome profiles in early pediatric MS and age and sex matched controls.
 DESIGN/METHODS: Children â‰¤18 years old attending a University of California, San Francisco pediatric clinic were invited to participate in a genetic and environmental risk factors study (NS071463,PI:Waubant). MS cases were within 2 years of onset. Controls were free from autoimmune disorders (asthma and eczema allowed). Stools were shipped on ice and stored at -80C. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from extracted DNA and bacterial profiles were generated using the PhyloChip G3 microarray (Second Genome, Inc., CA). Associations between the pediatric characteristics and variation in the bacterial community composition were assessed using nonmetric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate analysis of variance with distance matrices.
 RESULTS: Between Nov/2011-Nov/2013, 20 MS (10 girls, 10 boys) and 16 controls (9 girls, 7 boys) aged 13.2 years (mean; SD=3.84; range 4-18) provided stool samples. Within two months pre-stool collection, 3 children (2 cases, 1 control) were exposed to an antibiotic, 10 (8 cases, 2 controls) to a corticosteroid and 12 to an immuno-modulatory or -suppressant drug (10 cases, 2 controls). All cases met McDonald criteria, had relapsing-remitting MS and a short disease duration (mean=11 months; range 2-24 at stool collection). The median EDSS at enrolment was 2.0 (range 0-4.0). Preliminary microbiome results indicated significant differences in specific bacterial taxa between cases and controls, with enriched tax predominated by Proteobacteria (e.g. Shigella, Escherichia), p<0.001, false discovery rates, q<0.192. Depleted taxa displayed greater heterogeneity, and included Firmicutes (Eubacterium rectale) and Actinobacteria (Corynebacterium) but also higher false discovery rates (all q<0.372 and p<0.044).
 CONCLUSIONS: Specific taxa were significantly altered in relative abundance in very early onset pediatric MS, with enrichment for microbiota known to be associated with gastrointestinal infectious processes.

52480d85d5bb939471b2b7f806313f0b5223cb01,Enhancing reproducibility of gene expression analysis with known protein functional relationships: The concept of well-associated protein,Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) is well recognized to be variable across independent replications of genome-wide transcriptional studies. These are often employed to characterize disease state early in the process of discovery and prioritize novel targets aimed at addressing unmet medical need. Increasing reproducibility of biological findings from these studies could potentially positively impact the success rate of new clinical interventions. This work demonstrates that statistically sound combination of gene expression data with prior knowledge about biology in the form of large protein interaction networks can yield quantitatively more reproducible observations from studies characterizing human disease. The novel concept of Well-Associated Proteins (WAPs) introduced herein-gene products significantly associated on protein interaction networks with the differences in transcript levels between control and disease-does not require choosing a differential expression threshold and can be computed efficiently enough to enable false discovery rate estimation via permutation. Reproducibility of WAPs is shown to be on average superior to that of DEGs under easily-quantifiable conditions suggesting that they can yield a significantly more robust description of disease. Enhanced reproducibility of WAPs versus DEGs is first demonstrated with four independent data sets focused on systemic sclerosis. This finding is then validated over thousands of pairs of data sets obtained by random partitions of large studies in several other diseases. Conditions that individual data sets must satisfy to yield robust WAP scores are examined. Reproducible identification of WAPs can potentially benefit drug target selection and precision medicine studies.,2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""JoÃ«l R.

We have attempted to create a comprehensive gene expression map that will assist in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic selection in RCC. We performed expression profiling for 300 kidney specimens (150 clear cell, 38 papillary, 20 chromophobe, 25 metastatic, 4 collecting duct RCC, 20 oncocytoma, 21 Wilmsâ€™ tumors, 10 unclassified, and 12 noncancerous renal samples) with Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays (54,675 probe sets). We performed both clara and hierarchical clustering on the data set filtered for variation, selected discriminating gene clusters by principal component analysis, and annotated these clusters with the goCluster Bioconductor packages with a false discovery rate of 0.01. In addition, we also correlate the long-term clinical follow-up data in 150 cases of clear cell and papillary RCC with expression data. Comparative genomic microarray analysis was used to infer cytogenetic profiles for the array profiles. To identify potential developmental pathways activated in the separate subtypes, we identified genes activated in every individual RCC subtypes. All array profiles grouped by histology on principal component analysis. We identified a large number of functionally distinct genetic modules of co-expressed genes in the data set, one such example being a distinct angiogenic 21-transcript cluster activated in clear cell RCC, well-known as a hypervascular cancer characterized by dysregulation of hypoxia-response pathways. We additionally generated a 3-transcript predictor that was able to classify the various epithelial RCC subtypes with high accuracy. We report multiple regional expression biases characteristic of each subtype, corresponding to both established and novel cytogenetic aberrations. Finally, we identified the prognostic sets of genes for both clear cell and papillary RCC. We present a comprehensive expression map of kidney cancer, with ontological annotation of co-expressed genetic modules, as well as corresponding inferred cytogenetic profiles. This has allowed the generation of clinically useful predictors of histology and their prognosis. Additionally, we highlight kinases, developmental genes and pathways that potentially participate in tumor progression in each subtype of epithelial RCC which may also serve as potential therapeutic targets.",2006,Biology,"list(name = ""Bin Tean Teh"", ids = ""1794671"")",,,Cancer Research,66,1338-1338

This use of coherent fiducial inference with hierarchical models generates set estimators that propagate uncertainty to varying degrees. Some of the set estimates approach estimates from plug-in empirical Bayes methods for high numbers of comparisons and can come close to the usual confidence sets given a sufficiently low number of comparisons.,2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""David R.

964e0e4e9367dfbbc1bf44b0f6ae44e96414904c,NPSR1 polymorphisms influence recurrent abdominal pain in children: a population-based study.,"BACKGROUND
Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) occurs frequently among children and is one of the cardinal symptoms of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). The mechanisms of visceral pain and RAP are not fully understood. A heritable component has been demonstrated and a few candidate genes proposed. NPSR1 encodes the receptor for neuropeptide S (NPS) and NPS-NPSR1 signaling is involved in anxiety, inflammation, and nociception. NPSR1 polymorphisms are associated with asthma and chronic inflammatory diseases, but also with IBS-related intermediate phenotypes such as colonic transit time and rectal sensory ratings. Here, we sought to determine whether genetic variability in the NPSR1 gene influences the presence of RAP in children.


METHODS
Twenty-eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NPSR1 gene region were successfully genotyped in 1744 children from the Swedish birth cohort BAMSE. Questionnaire information was used to define RAP as episodes of abdominal pain occurring at least once a month in 12-year-olds.


KEY RESULTS
The prevalence of RAP was 9% in BAMSE. Association with RAP was observed for seven NPSR1 SNPs, five of which withstood false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing (best pÂ =Â 0.00054, OR: 1.55 for SNP rs2530566). The associated SNPs all map in a putative regulatory region upstream NPSR1, where they may exert their genetic effects through the modulation of gene expression.

28901a154af6dc387ef9bc42941c79cfee541cd0,Temporal analysis of reciprocal miRNA-mRNA expression patterns predicts regulatory networks during differentiation in human skeletal muscle cells.,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression through posttranscriptional repression of target genes. miRNAs exert a fundamental level of control over many developmental processes, but their role in the differentiation and development of skeletal muscle from myogenic progenitor cells in humans remains incompletely understood. Using primary cultures established from human skeletal muscle satellite cells, we performed microarray profiling of miRNA expression during differentiation of myoblasts (day 0) into myotubes at 48 h intervals (day 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). Based on a time-course analysis, we identified 44 miRNAs with altered expression [false discovery rate (FDR) < 5%, fold change > Â±1.2] during differentiation, including the marked upregulation of the canonical myogenic miRNAs miR-1, miR-133a, miR-133b, and miR-206. Microarray profiling of mRNA expression at day 0, 4, and 10 identified 842 and 949 genes differentially expressed (FDR < 10%) at day 4 and 10, respectively. At day 10, 42% of altered transcripts demonstrated reciprocal expression patterns in relation to the directional change of their in silico predicted regulatory miRNAs based on analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis microRNA Target Filter. Bioinformatic analysis predicted networks of regulation during differentiation including myomiRs miR-1/206 and miR-133a/b, miRNAs previously established in differentiation including miR-26 and miR-30, and novel miRNAs regulated during differentiation of human skeletal muscle cells such as miR-138-5p and miR-20a.

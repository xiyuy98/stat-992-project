784d5c09cafeaea5a8d269827ce0906c370920d3,Progressive Calibration and Averaging for Tandem Mass Spectrometry Statistical Confidence Estimation: Why Settle for a Single Decoy?,"Estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) among a list of tandem mass spectrum identifications is mostly done through target-decoy competition (TDC). Here we offer two new methods that can use an arbitrarily small number of additional randomly drawn decoy databases to improve TDC. Specifically, ""Partial Calibration"" utilizes a new meta-scoring scheme that allows us to gradually benefit from the increase in the number of identifications calibration yields and ""Averaged TDC"" (a-TDC) reduces the liberal bias of TDC for small FDR values and its variability throughout. Combining a-TDC with ""Progressive Calibration"" (PC), which attempts to find the ""right"" number of decoys required for calibration we see substantial impact in real datasets: when analyzing the Plasmodium falciparum data it typically yields almost the entire 17% increase in discoveries that ""full calibration"" yields (at FDR level 0.05) using 60 times fewer decoys. Our methods are further validated using a novel realistic simulation scheme and importantly, they apply more generally to the problem of controlling the FDR among discoveries from searching an incomplete database.",2017,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Uri Keich"", ids = ""2864261""); list(name = ""William Stafford Noble"", ids = ""144458655"")",84bf48112cac6b9fa7ad8fc4650b556abf7d13ab; b1f74feefadcfda8d03f6d23681def91056f2af1; fe7cde06c4af9b58915f9f675156adef60297ec2; 5982979b822c59f5eb41728a97aace7ab3815f02; 9d4e77b6d2487bdd6edcd9826ca039a4341fdc3d,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 067c511443cadcbdf8efbf5ae76fc664020d3442; 987718b23ff0c27c0cd99702ede5bbfd52b2ee93; 192aa8f561360c1078981cc8cec4cb809b940515; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 958005b26767ea3c2661487222758a1eac162331; ed58f4d45c78684079e205e141c6045227688d96; e0e48c3754dd1850561b2ba598d5a75259baa357; 3320d3f1e79fb734c356e0482d57f2fbb061ccfd; c283bf27e550b8d82ca84923fd846bf8eabf2bd6; f09d4a533a221b9b85c591ba1dc862dd2fe808a1; a5abe31321107a7e3b000899bf71ba26421ddb76; 1f897420cd3af1e0f183740cbf91938a8c8f0e38; cb84bccc93b19f5b90cfe8e719fe67e4db0c5149; c90be9508cd2c56d6e04c6c708fe8a866639a1be; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; b9dffb82bf70fb36b78b42e34d284c46d7a8a1f7,"Research in computational molecular biology : ...

There have been reports of gene responses to bilirubin, which was mostly attributed to its antioxidant function. Using RNA sequencing, we found that biliverdin, which is rapidly reduced to bilirubin, induced transcriptome responses in human HepG2 hepatocytes in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-Î±-dependent fashion (398 genes with >2-fold change; false discovery rate P < 0.05). For comparison, a much narrower set of genes demonstrated differential expression when PPAR-Î± was suppressed via lentiviral shRNA knockdown (23 genes). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed the bilirubin-PPAR-Î± transcriptome mediates pathways for oxidation-reduction processes, mitochondrial function, response to nutrients, fatty acid oxidation, and lipid homeostasis. Together, these findings suggest that transcriptome responses from the generation of bilirubin are mostly PPAR-Î± dependent, and its antioxidant function regulates a smaller set of genes.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Darren M.

a990d6a91a7a1c0a11dafc34753b9af143c1de56,Multiple testing under dependence via graphical models,"Large-scale multiple testing tasks often exhibit dependence. Leveraging the dependence between individual tests is still one challenging and important problem in statistics. With recent advances in graphical models, it is feasible to use them to capture the dependence among multiple hypotheses. We propose a multiple testing procedure which is based on a Markov-randomfield-coupled mixture model. The underlying true states of hypotheses are represented by a latent binary Markov random field, and the observed test statistics appear as the coupled mixture variables. The model can be learned by a novel EM algorithm. The next step is to infer the posterior probability that each hypothesis is null (termed local index of significance), and the false discovery rate can be controlled accordingly. We also provide a semiparametric variation of the graphical model which is useful in the situation where f1 (the density function of the test statistic under the alternative hypothesis) is heterogeneous among multiple hypotheses. This semiparametric approach exactly generalizes the local FDR procedure [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 96 (2001) 1151â€“1160] and connects with the BH procedure [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 57 (1995) 289â€“300]. Simulations show that the numerical performance of multiple testing can be improved substantially by using our procedure. We apply the procedure to a real-world genome-wide association study on breast cancer, and we identify several SNPs with strong association evidence.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jie Liu"", ids = ""49722516""); list(name = ""Chunming Zhang"", ids = ""48934972""); list(name = ""David C.

e1a7e28e7c4683133e996bf5106120ae1bd1caee,Integrating gene expression and phenotypic information to analyze Alzheimer's disease.,"The assessment of the relationship between gene expression profiling, clinical and histopathological phenotypes would be better suited to understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. We developed a multiple linear regression (MLR) method to simultaneously model three variables - Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) score and gene expression profile - to identify significant genes. These genes were also used to distinguish subjects with incipient AD from healthy controls. Finally we investigated the behavior of the significant genes across the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus of AD subjects in two different Braak stages. Results indicate that integrating multiple phenotypic and gene expression information of samples increases the power of methods while analyzing small datasets. The MLR method could identify significant genes at reasonable false discovery rates (FDRs), thereby providing a choice of reasonable FDRs. The accuracy in discriminating between subjects affected and unaffected by AD using MLR identified genes was high. We found that transcription and tumor suppressor responses do begin quite early in AD and therefore should be the target of drugs. Several genes were consistently up/down-regulated across the two brain regions and Braak stages and, therefore, can be used as predictive markers to detect AD at an earlier stage.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Monika Ray"", ids = ""49229574""); list(name = ""Weixiong Zhang"", ids = ""49039416"")",f4241648e76492496c91f26ec49a3a6f5f000d24; b911fc5ea97b621620793afb6a1700e1aaba700d; 28e7d6d1c83b1e1f8af38ab960cced0738966dce; c29aa11db0a1744b6cb1eb0cc49293a4d684a507,,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,16 1,"

c12f314e3992dd9d187bd6ecf092ae35ea7d17e8,Genome-wide interrogation of longitudinal FEV1 in children with asthma.,"RATIONALE
Most genomic studies of lung function have used phenotypic data derived from a single time-point (e.g., presence/absence of disease) without considering the dynamic progression of a chronic disease.


OBJECTIVES
To characterize lung function change over time in subjects with asthma and identify genetic contributors to a longitudinal phenotype.


METHODS
We present a method that models longitudinal FEV1 data, collected from 1,041 children with asthma who participated in the Childhood Asthma Management Program. This longitudinal progression model was built using population-based nonlinear mixed-effects modeling with an exponential structure and the determinants of age and height.


MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS
We found ethnicity was a key covariate for FEV1 level. Budesonide-treated children with asthma had a slight but significant effect on FEV1 when compared with those treated with placebo or nedocromil (P < 0.001). A genome-wide association study identified seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms nominally associated with longitudinal lung function phenotypes in 581 white Childhood Asthma Management Program subjects (P < 10(-4) in the placebo [""discovery""] and P < 0.05 in the nedocromil treatment [""replication""] group). Using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data, we found that some of the associated variants were in strong enhancer regions in human lung fibroblasts and may affect gene expression in human lung tissue. Genetic mapping restricted to genome-wide enhancer single-nucleotide polymorphisms in lung fibroblasts revealed a highly significant variant (rs6763931; P = 4 Ã— 10(-6); false discovery rate < 0.05).

1bd41ea147f30119224aa7bef0973654f69c127e,Gene expression variation between mouse inbred strains,"BackgroundIn this study, we investigated the effect of genetic background on expression profiles. We analysed the transcriptome of mouse hindlimb muscle of five frequently used mouse inbred strains using spotted oligonucleotide microarrays.ResultsThrough ANOVA analysis with a false discovery rate of 10%, we show that 1.4% of the analysed genes is significantly differentially expressed between these mouse strains. Differential expression of several of these genes has been confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. The number of genes affected by genetic background is approximately ten-fold lower than the number of differentially expressed genes caused by a dystrophic genetic defect.ConclusionsWe conclude that evaluation of the effect of background on gene expression profiles in the tissue under study is an effective and sensible approach when comparing expression patterns in animal models with heterogeneous genetic backgrounds. Genes affected by the genetic background can be excluded in subsequent analyses of the disease-related changes in expression profiles.

72ee161835e49f064088e833074e929cd0292af8,Subjective Cognitive Decline Is Associated With Altered Default Mode Network Connectivity in Individuals With a Family History of Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND
Both subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and a family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD) portend risk of brain abnormalities and progression to dementia. Posterior default mode network (pDMN) connectivity is altered early in the course of AD. It is unclear whether SCD predicts similar outcomes in cognitively normal individuals with a family history of AD.


METHODS
We studied 124 asymptomatic individuals with a family history of AD (age 64 Â± 5 years). Participants were categorized as having SCD if they reported that their memory was becoming worse (SCD+). We used extensive neuropsychological assessment to investigate five different cognitive domain performances at baseline (nÂ = 124) and 1 year later (nÂ = 59). We assessed interconnectivity among three a priori defined ROIs: pDMN, anterior ventral DMN, medial temporal memory system (MTMS), and the connectivity of each with the rest of brain.


RESULTS
Sixty-eight (55%) participants reported SCD. Baseline cognitive performance was comparable between groups (all false discovery rate-adjusted p values > .05). At follow-up, immediate and delayed memory improved across groups, but the improvement in immediate memory was reduced in SCD+ compared with SCD- (all false discovery rate-adjusted p values < .05). When compared with SCD-, SCD+ subjects showed increased pDMN-MTMS connectivity (false discovery rate-adjusted p < .05). Higher connectivity between the MTMS and the rest of the brain was associated with better baseline immediate memory, attention, and global cognition, whereas higher MTMS and pDMN-MTMS connectivity were associated with lower immediate memory over time (all false discovery rate-adjusted p values < .05).


CONCLUSIONS
SCD in cognitively normal individuals is associated with diminished immediate memory practice effects and a brain connectivity pattern that mirrors early AD-related connectivity failure.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sander C.

f304d2397368168011098b51180acfaa7a196dfa,Immobilized metal affinity chromatography revisited: pH/acid control toward high selectivity in phosphoproteomics.,"Despite recent advances in instrumentation and analytical strategies for identification and quantitation of protein phosphorylation, a highly specific enrichment protocol is still a challenge in large-scale studies. Here, we report a simple pH/acid control method that addresses the poor specificity seriously criticized in IMAC. Detailed evaluation of the capture and release mechanism in IMAC revealed that pH, buffer and salt yield a complex interplay in enrichment of phosphopeptides, yet they play individual roles in recovery and specificity. A revised one-step IMAC method with low sample loss and high specificity can be rationally designed by controlling salt, pH and the structure and concentration of organic acid. Without methyl esterification, the one-step IMAC enrichment with single LC-MS/MS identified 386 phosphoproteins in 550 mug of non-small-cell lung cancer cell lysate with 96% specificity. Additional fractionation by SDS-PAGE from 4 mg of cell lysate revealed the comprehensive proteome map, identifying 2747 phosphorylation sites from 2360 nondegenerate phosphopeptides and 1219 phosphoproteins with a false discovery rate of 0.63%. To our knowledge, this pH/acid-controlled IMAC procedure provides higher specificity than any other one-step IMAC purification procedure. Furthermore, the simple and reproducible IMAC protocol can be adapted to other solid supports, fully automated or manual, for large-scale identification of the vastly under-explored phosphoproteome.",2008,Chemistry;

37b036609b6d2ee56c804309f5724e3eb0c6fbcf,What is different about a radiologist's brain?,"PURPOSE
To investigate neuronal activations during processing of radiologic and nonradiologic images by experienced radiologists and nonradiologist subjects by using event-related functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study was approved by local ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained. Radiologic and control images were presented to 12 experienced radiologists (mean age, 35.8 years +/- 3.6 [standard deviation]) and 12 nonradiologist subjects (mean age, 33.0 years +/- 6.9). Half of the images were artificially manipulated-that is, for example, a local shadow was introduced. Subjects had to indicate whether a visually presented image was original or manipulated, while neuronal activity was assessed by using event-related functional MR imaging. Analysis was performed on the basis of fixed-effects general linear models with correction for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate).


RESULTS
Radiologic images, when compared with control images, evoked stronger activations exclusively in the group of radiologists, notably in the bilateral middle and inferior temporal gyrus, bilateral medial and middle frontal gyrus, and left superior and inferior frontal gyrus (P < .001, corrected). Additionally, visual processing of control images (ie, nonradiologic images) differed significantly between experienced radiologists and nonradiologist subjects (P < .001, corrected). Radiologists showed strongest activation in the left-dominant more posterior superior and inferior parietal lobule, while nonradiologist subjects showed strongest activation in the right-dominant more anterior superior and inferior parietal lobule and postcentral gyrus.


CONCLUSION
With radiologic experience, there is selective enhancement of brain activation with radiologic images, and the visual system is modified in general.",2005,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sven Haller"", ids = ""144398737""); list(name = ""Ernst Wilhelm Radue"", ids = ""2544348"")",a8196f629fb51c9f1b30b755718c5fc27fe5a37f; c889f3a39005b66f661ef4486a950bc6f8f33495; 2f99a8789b0268290c75274af2af873f3b190941; 7a6bd2988cc3898e4435402d8453b63ad23c0116; 7d627a5ca97a0c2b692bd7db78e2663cce9a1f37; 058d93de77324837e46709b4410757df764b91fb; 84311fff6aecc14aab13e8eea99cb5d71b8e2cd0; 7e05acabe21a69b8248942ca8add3297b166c15f; 67be58fa9fc4d97dcf7f5f995fa9dde6d2fd4296; 5ba9b4853f9f6819f0332552dac542dce63ebb51; 824b8be373313595954e55bf303f6a06c4233dec; 1b67c1613e90b94922359fd1360d13905aaca987; d43496d4afdc369a29fef6b7b790f2cc8bfaa09f; 013d5d2a22b09e7675c7f582cfd0a250f70d8be2; f801d352040cc99e505adcfa1783935550422cbc; 225685c7c8c08ab17920e7fd2fe20a9439ddf7f2,191b8d716356c31132a7e0018d26556422294c46; 4130cc5e130a1e0d07bc05e57670e2ef6df85cfa; ea1c8647e1a32142a621e5ff7204978215bc3f61; 27ff8115a48b06e41248e3b958ac872a9685efa4; 6d5b4a4d0ceb80d38ff99f90a1d86b9af2a161fc; a2a785a9bc5a66feb54875d3ef17d8354b713ca9; 3c2ae492711ee8ba6b5893263d1399646ed4a668; 17c9a530cd0203d19d111be82860c60574909587; 9d18b17e3955e4e2ac8881cfe26f30e3f2a89820; 1364ef58aab071fe17cfc415ada48059af394762; a59f17d3dfacccafd71e17b3019c95a1e9c0ab57; ee8b2e2059798996c986877220929b9f3419d9ce; 781ee20481f4e2e4accfa2b1cd6d70d5854bb171; d2a977118b3e22288661094c3150f821d94a1cb9; f2c1ddf5c34a5899c5cbee5b5dc469f39ff9c21e; d1f5030bf38afcbbc41e55dfbe98ec39de2955e0; 63a03086faa6a982aea814a3e23e26521c4988d9; da13525326a64bda23030e2271fe05bb03886ee7; c97c4e29dfce48e530bdc5e9beab89474cd9f936; c5ea54db449e329d9b07418d291bfb25d0a1b149; a8171ca4a6fe976cd4e65bc8f0ffedb5c5cd5b48; 1aa8573146a58398f087d4b6651abae947332e6c,Radiology,236 3,"

High-dimensional models are characterized by having a number of unknown parameters that is not vanishingly small relative to the sample size. We first present results in a framework where estimators of parameters of interest may be represented directly as approximate means. Within this context, we review fundamental results including high-dimensional central limit theorems, bootstrap approximation of high-dimensional limit distributions, and moderate deviation theory. We also review key concepts underlying inference when many parameters are of interest such as multiple testing with family-wise error rate or false discovery rate control. We then turn to a general high-dimensional minimum distance framework with a special focus on generalized method of moments problems where we present results for estimation and inference about model parameters. The presented results cover a wide array of econometric applications, and we discuss several leading special cases including high-dimensional linear regression and linear instrumental variables models to illustrate the general results.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Alexandre Belloni"", ids = ""3026075""); list(name = ""Victor Chernozhukov"", ids = ""26331346""); list(name = ""Denis Chetverikov"", ids = ""88741529""); list(name = ""Christian Hansen"", ids = ""144613163""); list(name = ""Kengo Kato"", ids = ""1853215"")",75c05a9e1d427192808d534ff0b468c27d4a4587; 38705aa9e8ce6412d89c5b2beb9379b1013b33c2; 869bed2040e2ac4020cbe78489e1226c8b84f642; 2c153a65590a9521801996a408d9f40fd870e83b; ff10068d8bcdfee2a2ea38dd922e8d749d47434c,,,,

By using reciprocal densities of surface membrane CXCR4 and CD5, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells can be divided into 3 fractions indicating time since last division (proliferative, intermediate, and resting). It has been suggested that cells in these fractions represent a continuum from resting to intermediate to proliferative. In this study, we made intraclonal gene expression profile (GEP) comparisons of these fractions from 17 CLL patients to try to confirm this notion and interclonal comparisons between U-CLL and M-CLL patients to determine if pathways involved in the actions of these fractions differed between patient subgroups.

PBMCs from 8 U-CLL and 9 M-CLL patients were sorted into 3 fractions (CD19+CD3âˆ’CD5hiCXCR4lo, PROLIF), (CD19+CD3âˆ’CD5intCXCR4int, INTERM), and (CD19+CD3âˆ’CD5loCXCR4hi, REST); RNA was purified from each, and gene expression microarrays using Illumina HumanHT12 beadchips performed. To determine differentially expressed genes in intraclonal comparisons, expression value ratios for fractions from each patient were computed, log-transformed, and Student t -test performed using R ([www.r-project.org][1]); for interclonal comparisons, raw GEP data between subpopulations were compared: U-PROLIF and M-PROLIF, and U-REST and M-REST. Sets of significant genes (â‰¥1.5 fold change and P<0.01) were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).

Upon plotting intraclonal average log ratios of PROLIF/INTERM vs INTERM/REST, it was clear that gene expression levels changed in the same direction, i.e. PROLIF>INTERM>REST, or PROLIF<INTERM<REST, consistent with a continuum between the 3 fractions. Within this pattern, 36 genes were significant for both plotted ratios. Of these, 29 were overexpressed, along with CD5; CD68, ITGAX, CCND2, CRIP1 and LGALS1 were the highest. Functional analysis using IPA showed these genes to be related to NFkB signaling and cell trafficking. Seven genes (ADARB1, BACH2, CNTNAP2, HRK, RHPN2, PRPML, and RXPA) were significantly downregulated, along with CXCR4.

Next we characterized GEP differences between the PROLIF and REST fractions, identifying 390 genes up-regulated in PROLIF and 244 in REST. The top 5 upregulated PROLIF genes were CD68, LY96, ITGAX, CCND2 and CRIP1, and the top 5 REST genes were BACH2, CXCR4, ADARB1, RHPN2 and HRK. Functionally, the upregulated PROLIF genes were related to BCR signaling, cytokines (IFNa, IL12), NFkB, and Akt, whereas the upregulated REST genes related to BCL2, cell death and cell movement. By GSEA, 813/881 gene sets, defined by expression neighborhoods centered on cancer associated genes, were upregulated in the PROLIF with 436 gene sets significant at a false discovery rate (FDR) <10%; 206 sets were significantly enriched with p value <0.01. For the REST, 68/881 gene sets were upregulated, with none significant even at FDR <25%.

Finally, we examined PROLIF and REST fractions from U-CLL vs M-CLL patients. In this interclonal analysis, 93 genes were significantly different between U-PROLIF and M-PROLIF. The top 5 in U-PROLIF were MSI2, TGFBR3, TP53I3, RGCC and IGSF3, and the top 5 in M-PROLIF were MTSS1, BACE2, BRI3BP, AP3B1 and UBE2G2. Similarly, there were 125 genes that were significantly different between U-REST and M-REST. The top 5 in U-REST were DUSP26, CLEC2B, MDK, and EGR2 and in M-REST were NAPSA, RAB24, TARDBP, KCNN4 and ADD3. Interestingly, U-PROLIF and M-PROLIF differed in pathway assignments, with upregulated genes in U-PROLIF contributing to cell signaling and activation, particularly implicating Akt, ERK and P38MAPK.

The intraclonal gene GEP analysis on these 3 fractions confirms that CLL clones contain a spectrum of cells that transition in a sequential manner from PROLIF to INTERM to REST fractions. Functional analyses show that genes upregulated in PROLIF correlate with cell signaling and proliferation, while genes upregulated in REST relate to cell death. Thus the PROLIF fraction is enriched in recently divided cells that likely exit from lymphoid tissue and the REST in older, less vital cells that either traffic to lymphoid tissue or die. The interclonal analysis implies that the stimuli and/or the responses of cells in the PROLIF and REST fractions differ between U-CLL and M-CLL. This last novel finding suggests either distinct cells of origin or distinct activation pathways for the IGHV -defined CLL subsets.

e10f11f4dc0e7e2f48577b47910b3d69d74466f3,Differential Gene Expression Patterns and Interaction Networks in BCR/ABL Positive and Negative Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemias.,"BCR/ABL is associated with an unfavorable prognosis in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We used DNA microarrays to identify gene expression profiles and molecular interaction networks related to BCR/ABL status and clinical outcome in a set of 54 adult ALL specimens from the MRC UKALL XII/ECOG E2993 intergroup study (21 p185BCR/ABL- and 16 p210BCR/ABL-positive and 17 BCR/ABL negative). In order to avoid biases associated with commonly used sample amplification procedures, we have implemented an indirect two-step labeling protocol based on signal amplification by use of dendrimer technology. Using a two-class, non-parametric t-test and a false discovery rate cutoff of 5%, we identified 271 genes (including GAB1, CIITA, XBP1, CD83, SERPINB9, PTP4A3, NOV, LOX, CTNND1, BAALC and RAB21) as differentially expressed in BCR/ABL positive ALL compared with BCR/ABL negative ALL. They separate these two classes of adult ALL with an overall accuracy of 93% and are enriched for three highly relevant biological functions: Cellular Growth and Proliferation (57 genes, p = 0.004â€“0.044), Cell Death (49 genes, p = 0.0007â€“0.049), and Hematological System Development and Function (40 genes, p = 0.00004â€“0.049). Network analysis demonstrated complex interaction patterns of these genes, and identified FYN and IL15 as the hubs of the top-scoring network. We confirmed these findings by both qRT-PCR analysis of the initial set of samples and by cross-platform validation in an independent cohort of 128 adult ALL specimens. In addition, within the BCR/ABL positive subgroup, we identified 14 clones found to be over-expressed (TSPAN16, ADAMTSL4) or under-expressed (PILRB, STS-1, SPRY1) in p185BCR-ABL- relative to p210BCR-ABL-ALL. In a nearest-centroid classification, these clones correctly predict the BCR/ABL subtype with a cross-validated prediction accuracy of 95%. No differential gene expression was detected among Rho family GTPases and their known interaction partners. Finally, we constructed a gene expression- and interaction-based outcome predictor consisting of 27 genes (including GRB2, GAB1, GLI1, IRS1, RUNX2 and SPP1), which strongly correlated with overall survival in BCR/ABL positive adult ALL (p=0.0001), independently of other clinical parameters such as age (p=0.25) and white blood cell count at presentation (p = 0.003). These findings may be useful for developing novel therapeutic targets and prognostic markers in adult ALL.",2006,Biology,"list(name = ""Dejan Juric"", ids = ""3342243""); list(name = ""Norman J Lacayo"", ids = ""5343421""); list(name = ""Meghan E.

6d6a55b6dfccf5477a9dae43e1ac591fb680ff2e,MicroRNAâ€“mRNA expression profiles associated with medulloblastoma subgroup 4,"Purpose
Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant brain tumor in children, is divided into four tumor subgroups: wingless-type (WNT), sonic hedgehog (SHH), Group 3, and Group 4. Ideally, clinical practice and treatment design should be subgroup specific. While WNT and SHH subgroups have well-defined biomarkers, distinguishing Group 3 from Group 4 is not straightforward. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate posttranscriptional gene expression, are involved in MB tumorigenesis. However, the miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) regulatory network in MB is far from being fully understood. Our aims were to investigate miRNA expression regulation in MB subgroups, to assess miRNA target relationships, and to identify miRNAs that can distinguish Group 3 from Group 4.


Patients and methods
With these aims, integrated transcriptome mRNA and miRNA expression analysis was performed on primary tumor samples collected from 18 children with MB, using miRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and quantitative PCR.


Results
Of all the expressed miRNAs, 19 appeared to be significantly differentially expressed (DE) between Group 4 and non-Group 4 subgroups (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05), including 10 miRNAs, which, for the first time, are reported to be in conjunction with MB. RNA-seq analysis identified 165 genes that were DE between Group 4 and the other subgroups (FDR <0.05), among which seven are predicted targets of five DE miRNAs and exhibit inverse expression pattern.


Conclusion
This study identified miRNA molecules that may be involved in Group 4 etiology, in general, and can distinguish between Group 3 and Group 4, in particular. In addition, understanding the involvement of miRNAs and their targets in MB may improve diagnosis and advance the development of targeted treatment for MB.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sivan Gershanov"", ids = ""4324421""); list(name = ""Helen Toledano"", ids = ""4320203""); list(name = ""Shalom Michowiz"", ids = ""3814326""); list(name = ""Orit Barinfeld"", ids = ""17793234""); list(name = ""Albert Pinhasov"", ids = ""8122924""); list(name = ""Nitza Goldenberg-Cohen"", ids = ""1401424344""); list(name = ""Mali Salmon-Divon"", ids = ""1398554898"")",1c7093eda74606dd9dfd431f29f1ca8d378aea61; 1114e8b04c8ce4255a22eeacd6385901f4b944dd,335b30c82955a89f6178a4d9ebf8e730fa8d6b2c; 32c42de64130b3b8b012360f7c4ce87903bb4298; 18770923b95dbd9033c7f3d69f362f28faa51ee0; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 80595b1af338c67203a8c9062144f3c92dd686d1; 0b1f21d68dc5f7b6e8cb62b21f5a8ba7b91f548c; a992c8fd24587f12d41f48df84b29d847634c0e4; d55f25fcb8cc64ac42cf129c1ebdf66c9a27c724; 8ab2c11ac0a620b83a91be9e7e8bd0b1b0de0f98; b828bfa8b14fe6fe74438e829d5efc3eb2dfd328; a451b4d14d7cf3bd40ac2fbe50e31aa4ac5f0cbe; 52d0b9049798f2ecf206a36a3ef49d8551f2d042; 8c31501a05c1b2dc1df40b86efcb325ba79a884b; a6c6a91f3491e047b8084b69c425f15a07d2aa21; 3872f58c5713cb8d2ce92e7eaea8f241e5f60f2a; 75a234a3787d33f45d72fe6f800b8db026c7b031; f5822d5e6a06bab73246a589be78fe947e469eb5; 771c61421cd5d27caec863811231de7ba2cc2112; a43a1efe93540894ec0cd607f2852970088c95c0; 60dbcdf88ef4b73eb744a537113f07beea3d537c; fdcb7b923ce14e973e0e704eaab7497f3132bcbf; b7d0914eabb95a3e11d2800c0472da20f9971d3f; 8beec0343584efc297c96f540bdbef554edf7d12; 0af86ec7429a4247c877d4c9e0ff4d0fe08b6f08; 7215c1ae3560c4b1b86df39cc791de38bacf61fc; 63656d14110c0c17c66f260922d79c8e57556a78; 98645474df8da6e23df3782656b4063e879404b5; ab5716fcabcdf2a1359d7140913e140287190cf0; 4c416232fbf9d7471aef3443ebb26dfb2f182d44; 7abf79103497ea2cac1a0b4fc484d30649d3d1ad; 6d36294efab5763653c9d6a7ae24a052d54f8986; db64dfac09fa08f141fbc69ead71dc295ba9c355; 254c116164dd2290215aa732f2fcdabe9efdfd3d; 632edd9b828b7ab3cbec36403a21d006a2618cf5; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; cedf9e431b01c6463c61a933d8d160284f696419; 2e39c86b27f849723e431a364c9ae27e89693d16; 41ec6663f08d5b9d0ca52dae62e7924f3ebda09a; 4ac5d4c64a2c2525a60e5ec6ce1317bf7ae94fd8; 439bf77321d4d6c04efa3d060b4af7757ad8978f; 6b505eeff301f0ce27808bedd7a6378339e25987; 8faf1b456ab85996b5279e20dc8a61447c0dc71b; 7a9b3e1bc66f334d28a12a32383ce9903dd2bee0; 45803a2386946716508fb9091a723d21474bbeb7; ce50e39fc940b4d1eb966e9f11fde456f504c4e8; 998dfb4ac3246460a842620669037afc133f8fb2; 82d950bbd43e6611fd5d61d766a606f63008e682; 7fbd679211ec01b2751958f0128fd97ac71996b1; aeb88e54c9a0fe83f448b84e3ebe6d57c79f19cc; 7a1b7a5f537bf3edba06b4679353ca14930281a6; 712a0934c0e056921d249016b325adff4d841267; c8d4276694d7e189d9c43310bb64dc8573a7a176; b4c48399218c693b00ea48f40d46ccea2bf85f21; 032064a97780f6eab6a7ff7aaaba55b4b4a4f81b; c45031689fe1667b328bbf67b6179a8c766e74d2; 028cec8d9a286d942575b1f5f8935091620745bc; dd6029e758bc04391461bb63c86d772277cd5be9; 77ef9aac7e0199184cb3169ac5e4de1d5fd7152b; 2e81f9e2b49ab08bbeca526b63163052fa5b9576; f55b0476eae94742e77590fb2cb8bb54b661b95b; 7de8b5ce383f19493ec3b1407115970229885b61; 8917b76eacbd57ff9640214c3931d7057f111834,Cancer Management and Research,10,339 - 352
dfe62b0f82556dde73275d8b49c67aa843c43bc5,"Coronary artery disease, genetic risk and the metabolome in young individuals","Background: Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in adults - the leading cause of death worldwide. It often occurs later in life, but variants may impact CAD-relevantÂ phenotypesÂ earlyÂ andÂ throughoutÂ theÂ life-course. Cohorts with longitudinal and genetic data on thousands of individuals are letting us explore the antecedents of this adult disease. Methods: 149 metabolites, with a focus on the lipidome, measured using nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1H-NMR) spectroscopy, and genotype data were available from 5,905 individuals at ages 7, 15, and 17 years from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Linear regression was used to assess the association between the metabolites and an adult-derived genetic risk score (GRS) of CAD comprising 146 variants. Individual variant-metabolite associations were also examined. Results: The CAD-GRS associated with 118 of 149 metabolites (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05), the strongest associations being with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and atherogenic non-LDL subgroups. Nine of 146 variants in the GRS associated with one or more metabolites (FDR < 0.05). Seven of these are within lipid loci: rs11591147 PCSK9, rs12149545 HERPUD1-CETP, rs17091891 LPL, rs515135 APOB, rs602633 CELSR2-PSRC1, rs651821 APOA5, rs7412 APOE-APOC1. All associated with metabolites in the LDL or atherogenic non-LDL subgroups or both including aggregate cholesterol measures. The other two variants identified were rs112635299 SERPINA1 and rs2519093 ABO. Conclusions: Genetic variants that influence CAD risk in adults are associated with large perturbations in metabolite levels in individuals as young as seven. The variants identified are mostly within lipid-related loci and the metabolites they associated with are primarily linked to lipoproteins. This knowledge could allow for preventative measures, such as increased monitoring of at-risk individuals and perhaps treatment earlier in life, to be taken years before any symptoms of the disease arise.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Thomas Battram"", ids = ""81603859""); list(name = ""Luke Hoskins"", ids = ""81411626""); list(name = ""David A.

3a1735c35a6327f2242f3f2590571f968981bdf5,Differential expression of microRNAs in normal and inflamed human pulps.,"INTRODUCTION
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression via posttranscriptional repression. They are critical to normal cellular function, and bioinformatic predictions indicate that at least one third of all messenger RNAs might be regulated by miRNAs. Although both the innate and adaptive immune responses are known to be regulated by miRNAs, their role in regulating endodontic disease has yet to be explored. The purpose of this study was to examine the differential expression of miRNAs in normal and inflamed human dental pulps and to explore their functional gene targets.


METHODS
After obtaining informed consent, we collected normal and inflamed human pulps (N = 30). Microarray and molecular biology techniques were then used for gene profiling and identifying functional gene targets.


RESULTS
Of the 335 human miRNAs identified in the pulp tissues, 3 miRNAs, miR-150âˆ—, miR-584, and miR-766, were significantly up-regulated in inflamed pulps as compared with normal pulps (P < .003). Thirty-three miRNAs were down-regulated in the inflamed pulps (P < .003). The false discovery rate for these findings is estimated to be approximately 5%. The potential gene targets for these miRNAs include proinflammatory cytokines as well as other key mediators of the immune and inflammatory response to infection.


CONCLUSIONS

a906c3e77f8e4e643e8a3ec16b02fafdd37cbc4b,Laser capture microdissection of human pancreatic islets reveals novel eQTLs associated with type 2 diabetes,"OBJECTIVE
Genome wide association studies (GWAS) for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have identified genetic loci that often localise in non-coding regions of the genome, suggesting gene regulation effects. We combined genetic and transcriptomic analysis from human islets obtained from brain-dead organ donors or surgical patients to detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and shed light into the regulatory mechanisms of these genes.


METHODS
Pancreatic islets were isolated either by laser capture microdissection (LCM) from surgical specimens of 103 metabolically phenotyped pancreatectomized patients (PPP) or by collagenase digestion of pancreas from 100 brain-dead organ donors (OD). Genotyping (> 8.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms) and expression (> 47,000 transcripts and splice variants) analyses were combined to generate cis-eQTLs.


RESULTS
After applying genome-wide false discovery rate significance thresholds, we identified 1,173 and 1,021 eQTLs in samples of OD and PPP, respectively. Among the strongest eQTLs shared between OD and PPP were CHURC1 (OD p-value=1.71Â Ã—Â 10-24; PPP p-valueÂ =Â 3.64Â Ã—Â 10-24) and PSPH (OD p-valueÂ =Â 3.92Â Ã—Â 10-26; PPP p-valueÂ =Â 3.64Â Ã—Â 10-24). We identified eQTLs in linkage-disequilibrium with GWAS loci T2D and associated traits, including TTLL6, MLX and KIF9 loci, which do not implicate the nearest gene. We found in the PPP datasets 11 eQTL genes, which were differentially expressed in T2D and two genes (CYP4V2 and TSEN2) associated with HbA1c but none in the OD samples.


CONCLUSIONS
eQTL analysis of LCM islets from PPP led us to identify novel genes which had not been previously linked to islet biology and T2D. The understanding gained from eQTL approaches, especially using surgical samples of living patients, provides a more accurate 3-dimensional representation than those from genetic studies alone.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Amna Khamis"", ids = ""3755641""); list(name = ""MickaÃ«l Canouil"", ids = ""9515016""); list(name = ""Afshan Siddiq"", ids = ""51898803""); list(name = ""Hutokshi Crouch"", ids = ""91432378""); list(name = ""Mario Falchi"", ids = ""1862490""); list(name = ""Manon von Bulow"", ids = ""91050790""); list(name = ""Florian Ehehalt"", ids = ""4310280""); list(name = ""Lorella Marselli"", ids = ""2955241""); list(name = ""Marius Distler"", ids = ""4537534""); list(name = ""Daniela Richter"", ids = ""48524801""); list(name = ""JÃ¼rgen Weitz"", ids = ""143997712""); list(name = ""Krister Bokvist"", ids = ""5287384""); list(name = ""Ioannis Xenarios"", ids = ""1793133""); list(name = ""Bernard Thorens"", ids = ""2755229""); list(name = ""Anke M Schulte"", ids = ""144304433""); list(name = ""Mark Ibberson"", ids = ""2213562""); list(name = ""AmÃ©lie Bonnefond"", ids = ""49102764""); list(name = ""Piero Marchetti"", ids = ""48711432""); list(name = ""Michele Solimena"", ids = ""6354048""); list(name = ""Philippe Froguel"", ids = ""145263255"")",ca8d953e82ac513761dc845a07c28508b809637e; 684ff8b7dc862c7094e27b51783ede6014894c18; 5e33cf26db580f2366a7a9893a943b8a2544b606; eafb9222fc21150551f1f008e6d5ecfcd4b07c19; 5356b309b295b182a150140d600b3cd6f5882bff,f3db2a451854d5d81f3e440f8c99cc67ba63fc80; 1cc0e7b3026975860d99ddc77c054f1319dd3e7a; f9ab184b3afe94e2ac5b97d3f08321d422eeae42; c75f827cefef8da91be9e88d8a99ab308428084a; e3a77fe8545e98ffc144392fed2094cf04e90cf0; d0eed12615f4a162af76bec6adb4d7325b10ae53; 659cd30eb8de887dc7a7248d42c44742799bd157; 7086fd4c17236d1a602098e010ecb9a8742867bb; 4a19adb2b506ec16dc67d1883ce9161309721c46; a6d2cc4c78098cb50292aa3bb67b98d0ec64aa52; f0f9da69867fbe4545464cf98f015df8d3987754; 7aba68a514e48659689221367884360d7b64aeb6; 006a6d8217e5452ddf97aadaf68e0a0728933b20; 5f4fdbabf1196a651d2ca1d866effb5a4f715504; d276a59508031a52115720666e278ad40231c598; ea86e9b967c37d6b637e3143060a7cade917441b; 11fbf163f018da6a005cbf9a910d11af64e529a9; 09e6d84f8173c13a96820c4d08e418c73b85be1f; d11a111c711d8fc5c6ab4b4cbd891013ee26edda; 1a8abaf507da138c2188552f22c54e13abcebfc6; 40852fa88537ec8515a2bccf1b50bccdd92754a2; 712f6b82182e234dcdd6e4a4aaf79365d3360a90; fe24e816c2e777d73e203c6283d018f211d9b194; 9bab3fb47e65ed07d4f09f1b3c3030a4771f549a; dc5b0aef5a4f1ea70bd6fab3656023f58a987609; 9384f27ee32dafd04da0d36d07cac2d32db108bd; 76b9c16988f5670db55a7fcd7256fc61c72db230; 44962d9b1a7ff35199b2a0e3858a8f37a8a1f377; 46a3b52ebb52bc88b217723f59288f90088c594d; a766bfbf6c5a47bad4f73d52707f8a7e1a09a98f; fe803541b8df97b2f17239d3dabfc75940cfd56f; 82fc0b5a95fb17e60beceeab5efad149f82c4713; 44391362cc0ac5db49f94263138e1dda580a5e72; d0a8566e46b7f3cfeb2c2b8fc0787067d1f9805a; b1fdd8c09f5e3f9f7a18cfb67dc4fc01d538b92c; 3a1b8791ee89c422d558cd104c3b2107047f771a; 576436a5629dc09a79867e82e08a84ada8ce45ae; b1396ce2cc5d667e5677fe169d63cdeb42a5d2ae; 89409f6c9981aa3a0ce4463e0f2990910d062534; 1409427a0fc13a35dfd34dfd54c2055cc4a67742; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4,Molecular Metabolism,24,98 - 107

Animal and human studies suggest that inflammation is associated with behavioral disorders including aggression. We have recently shown that physical aggression of boys during childhood is strongly associated with reduced plasma levels of cytokines IL-1Î±, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10, later in early adulthood. This study tests the hypothesis that there is an association between differential DNA methylation regions in cytokine genes in T cells and monocytes DNA in adult subjects and a trajectory of physical aggression from childhood to adolescence.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
We compared the methylation profiles of the entire genomic loci encompassing the IL-1Î±, IL-6, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-8 and three of their regulatory transcription factors (TF) NFkB1, NFAT5 and STAT6 genes in adult males on a chronic physical aggression trajectory (CPA) and males with the same background who followed a normal physical aggression trajectory (control group) from childhood to adolescence. We used the method of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation with comprehensive cytokine gene loci and TF loci microarray hybridization, statistical analysis and false discovery rate correction. We found differentially methylated regions to associate with CPA in both the cytokine loci as well as in their transcription factors loci analyzed. Some of these differentially methylated regions were located in known regulatory regions whereas others, to our knowledge, were previously unknown as regulatory areas. However, using the ENCODE database, we were able to identify key regulatory elements in many of these regions that indicate that they might be involved in the regulation of cytokine expression.


CONCLUSIONS
We provide here the first evidence for an association between differential DNA methylation in cytokines and their regulators in T cells and monocytes and male physical aggression.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Nadine ProvenÃ§al"", ids = ""4517020""); list(name = ""M.

fea071e16685cbadbb2758b840b848ecbde0acc2,The Role of 39 Psoriasis Risk Variants on Age of Psoriasis Onset,"Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple genetic risk factors for psoriasis, but data on their association with age of onset have been marginally explored. The goal of this study was to evaluate known risk alleles of psoriasis for association with age of psoriasis onset in three well-defined case-only cohorts totaling 1,498 psoriasis patients. We selected 39 genetic variants from psoriasis GWAS and tested these variants for association with age of psoriasis onset in a meta-analysis. We found that rs10484554 and rs12191877 near HLA-C and rs17716942 near IFIH1 were associated with age of psoriasis onset with false discovery rate < 0.05. The association between rs17716942 and age of onset was not replicated in a fourth independent cohort of 489 patients (P = 0.94). The imputed HLA-Câˆ—06:02 allele demonstrated a much stronger association with age of psoriasis onset than rs10484554 and rs12191877. We conclude that despite the discovery of numerous psoriasis risk alleles, HLA-Câˆ—06:02 still plays the most important role in determining the age of onset of psoriasis. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the contribution of other risk alleles, including IFIH1, to age of psoriasis onset.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yingchang Lu"", ids = ""50028840""); list(name = ""Sinae Kane"", ids = ""40377897""); list(name = ""Haoyan Chen"", ids = ""47666446""); list(name = ""Argentina Leon"", ids = ""4185392""); list(name = ""Ethan Charles Levin"", ids = ""3547271""); list(name = ""Tien Viet Nguyen"", ids = ""47523827""); list(name = ""Maya G Debbaneh"", ids = ""4418698""); list(name = ""Jillian Wong Millsop"", ids = ""6077534""); list(name = ""Rishu Gupta"", ids = ""6668148""); list(name = ""Monica Huynh"", ids = ""40408088""); list(name = ""Daniel G.

9e20011371a6fde4d470d73fffdd2b756055aa23,Sphingolipid metabolism potential in fecal microbiome and bronchiolitis in infants: a caseâ€“control study,"ObjectiveEmerging evidence demonstrated that the structure of fecal microbiome is associated with the likelihood of bronchiolitis in infants. However, no study has examined functional profiles of fecal microbiome in infants with bronchiolitis. In this context, we conducted a caseâ€“control study. As a part of multicenter prospective study, we collected stool samples from 40 infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis (cases). We concurrently enrolled 115 age-matched healthy controls.ResultsFirst, by applying 16S rRNA gene sequencing to these 155 fecal samples, we identified the taxonomic profiles of fecal microbiome. Next, based on the taxonomy data, we inferred the functional capabilities of fecal microbiome and tested for differences in the functional capabilities between cases and controls. Overall, the median age was 3Â months and 45% were female. Among 274 metabolic pathways surveyed, there were significant differences between bronchiolitis cases and healthy controls for 37 pathways, including lipid metabolic pathways (false discovery rate [FDR]Â <0.05). Particularly, the fecal microbiome of bronchiolitis cases had consistently higher abundances of gene function related to the sphingolipid metabolic pathways compared to that of controls (FDRÂ <0.05). These pathways were more abundant in infants with Bacteroides-dominant microbiome profile compared to the others (FDRÂ <0.001). On the basis of the predicted metagenome in this caseâ€“control study, we found significant differences in the functional potential of fecal microbiome between infants with bronchiolitis and healthy controls. Although causal inferences remain premature, our data suggest a potential link between the bacteria-derived metabolites, modulations of host immune response, and development of bronchiolitis.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kohei Hasegawa"", ids = ""2136894""); list(name = ""Christopher J.

098cce9ef67086bb513aa34b3267352bdd241217,Identifying candidate genes involved in osteoarthritis through bioinformatics analysis.,"OBJECTIVES
This study aims to identify candidate genes and critical pathways involved in osteoarthritis (OA).


METHODS
Gene expression data of synovial membrane from OA patients and normal controls (NCs) were downloaded from database. Totally, 15 OA and 14 NC chips were available. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified through limma package (log2 fold change >0.585, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING. Moreover, perturbation and pathway enrichment analyses were performed through PerturbationAnalyzer in Cytoscape (iterative criteria <1Ã—e-10) and clusterProfiler package (FDR <0.05), respectively.


RESULTS
Totally, 236 up-regulated and 290 down-regulated DEGs were identified. In PPI network, 10 hub genes were found, including VEGFA, IL6, JUN, IL1B, ICAM1, ATF3, IL8, EGR1, CDKN1A, and JUNB. After perturbation analysis, 32 DEGs were passively and significantly changed, like PISD, RARRES3, EIF4G1, and EPHA3. Furthermore, 526 DEGs were enriched in 176 pathways, and pathway cross-talk network was constructed, involving 12 pathways and 66 cross-talks.


CONCLUSIONS
Pathways like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoclast differentiation, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction might play critical roles in OA, and previously unreported genes VEGFA, JUN, JUNB, PISD, RARRES3, EIF4G1, and EPHA3 might participate in OA, providing novel directions for drug targeting.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xinying Zhang"", ids = ""1909745""); list(name = ""Zhengjiang Yuan"", ids = ""8590944""); list(name = ""Shuo Cui"", ids = ""46548348"")",2db8c3bb880b6c541bdb46722432c987336c2d74; 74d553eb865ef8a5ee2d7d87c90f0bf1102055f8; 53e2362bc23b559faa678f74054586552c346d25; d95721ad8bfaff7583deb9234c5d385870f48737; 82e2791cf2318f7c592867934fee4a76b7547f04,,Clinical and experimental rheumatology,34 2,"

a7f5ddee3d55d628eae68653dc3b34ffcd2d2075,On Online Control of False Discovery Rate,"Multiple hypotheses testing is a core problem in statistical inference and arises in almost every scientific field. Given a sequence of null hypotheses $\mathcal{H}(n) = (H_1,..., H_n)$, Benjamini and Hochberg \cite{benjamini1995controlling} introduced the false discovery rate (FDR) criterion, which is the expected proportion of false positives among rejected null hypotheses, and proposed a testing procedure that controls FDR below a pre-assigned significance level. They also proposed a different criterion, called mFDR, which does not control a property of the realized set of tests; rather it controls the ratio of expected number of false discoveries to the expected number of discoveries. 
In this paper, we propose two procedures for multiple hypotheses testing that we will call ""LOND"" and ""LORD"". These procedures control FDR and mFDR in an \emph{online manner}. Concretely, we consider an ordered --possibly infinite-- sequence of null hypotheses $\mathcal{H} = (H_1,H_2,H_3,...)$ where, at each step $i$, the statistician must decide whether to reject hypothesis $H_i$ having access only to the previous decisions. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first that controls FDR in this setting. This model was introduced by Foster and Stine \cite{alpha-investing} whose alpha-investing rule only controls mFDR in online manner. 
In order to compare different procedures, we develop lower bounds on the total discovery rate under the mixture model and prove that both LOND and LORD have nearly linear number of discoveries. We further propose adjustment to LOND to address arbitrary correlation among the $p$-values. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our procedures on both synthetic and real data comparing them with alpha-investing rule, Benjamin-Hochberg method and a Bonferroni procedure.",2015,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Adel Javanmard"", ids = ""2548570""); list(name = ""Andrea Montanari"", ids = ""145071265"")",1aec3ac8a6a3c83a625253fb65c07c3e9f2c3393; 2a3cd075bd4c0c88117d5d217a8115a7f32cbddd; 8e835bd75f760f7b0138ce9c73bece4ed69b6f28; 782b5102432d341384d5a58590ee1ad30bf0cbc5; 0e619d9f15654317046721f1d4b67d5f009de2c0; 4b9939462656dcccf3a2efcc6aabe357bcf54e68; b0397532153c0978f75bd542b73db0349db8ad1c; 6d30c134d4808ea49456baa62374a54e33dc8f9c; 4382f7ea8e46f91257b7de6beddc9a8d0eb9f4ff; 8c943c8fea75543c79f30b90d0d013bcab0060e1; cc2dc05c4b76a07fce0e3cd24cc5e517bce06754; 8bd05db8a361dc8e25eb043b9df8072705c6acb0; 52afbc1e9c1b16d9365d25ebe7f60bb973282bcb; dc0d302b6559c8fe9c8faefedd31f6eb120c9312; 5169721efbe314fc739504083259d06e1ce4ca0c; bf06b80f4df8c2afdad13ee9fbc258c4845bcdf7; edf27bb5272ea6fe244deb3bbc8da0429bfe3ac5; 2a996166c3e3c9373981d3fc1f60b71957987ead,d96de31c642ee0b147b761c8e9b6bbba39d887c0; 6410ec306cfec30aa85d2172ac9eba1ef5bea4cc; 48b8ae6a9f426fb516c41de6d80cf2d01329e2b5; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 8963b5c1a754741d6599b95e47818fe3b79a6a51; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 79e8b756f8cc59b4b5aaf1a7de7094f3a935803e; 95b1ddb21d6a0b66176ac3a9489e6e352d4eb697; 96c98cc1351265d2b36f63e32472a34ff38c41fc; 46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; 9ae5d584339143d4d97bed0eff1978bb3761b9a5; fe4deb22a36ad437b0e3afc441774c483fc9fdb6; 8125d755ad1fa64b869657d0f102836908af7a09; 22a872a231374563cc2aa8b13a75846222a41c74; 414c23024b2d2752d92b79eaa388c6fc689260a1; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 83a17e34882c24b4ff407f3e75525631d332df49; 905e264286c1b05a1f802659bb075a7cd5274492; 67f33b4ea84c8cf815a9919dd34fee6e85c22f6f; aaaae6628c9c33e165e5cd5538b27d9275c24347; ba7684a2a2b46a1ed9fc5bc0d18bda2de4eb455e; 3685e6f7e8817e91249332fc005951af1274044c; 38bb2fa3dcadf9fad63a0893f42c6d76b34ccb0e; 1b60c4fddb8ab5475bc3295a2d0af4b1167bc444,ArXiv,abs/1502.06197,
872904f4f3229d8d5a304d03cbd4480bbaebc306,Significant Decrease in Hippocampus and Amygdala Mean Diffusivity in Treatment-Resistant Depression Patients Who Respond to Electroconvulsive Therapy,"Introduction: The hippocampus plays a key role in depressive disorder, and the amygdala is involved in depressive disorder through the key role that it plays in emotional regulation. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may alter the microstructure of these two regions. Since mean diffusivity (MD), is known to be an indirect marker of microstructural integrity and can be derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans, we aim to test the hypothesis that treatment-resistant depression (TRD) patients undergoing bilateral (BL) ECT exhibit a decrease of MD in their hippocampus and amygdala. Methods: Patients, between 50 and 70 years of age, diagnosed with TRD were recruited from the University Hospital of Toulouse and assessed clinically (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, HAM-D) and by DTI scans at three time points: baseline, V2 (during treatment), and V3 within 1 week of completing ECT. Results: We included 15 patients, who were all responders. The left and right hippocampi and the left amygdala showed a significant decrease in MD at V3, compared to baseline [respectively: Î² = -2.78, t = -1.97, p = 0.04; Î² = -2.56, t = -2, p = 0.04; Î² = -2.5, t = -2.3, p = 0.04, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected]. MD did not decrease in the right amygdala. Only the left amygdala was significantly associated with a reduction in HAM-D (Ï = 0.55, p = 0.049, FDR corrected). Conclusion: MD is an indirect microstructural integrity marker, which decreases in the hippocampus and the left amygdala, during BL ECT in TRD populations. This could be interpreted as a normalization of microstructural integrity in these structures.",2019,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Antoine Yrondi"", ids = ""5104386""); list(name = ""Federico Nemmi"", ids = ""4608358""); list(name = ""Sophie Billoux"", ids = ""39274079""); list(name = ""AurÃ©lie Giron"", ids = ""87409892""); list(name = ""Marie Sporer"", ids = ""28138442""); list(name = ""Simon Taib"", ids = ""51110185""); list(name = ""Juliette Salles"", ids = ""40535989""); list(name = ""Damien Pierre"", ids = ""151478991""); list(name = ""C.

abc7e82647acbc7bd698931761b40e20cca34c1b,Studying the effects of correlation on protein selection in proteomics data.,"Recently, Efron (2007) provided methods for assessing the effect of correlation on false discovery rate (FDR) in large-scale testing problems in the context of microarray data. Although FDR procedure does not require independence of the tests, existence of correlation grossly under- or overestimates the number of critical genes. Here, we briefly review Efron's method and apply it to a relatively smaller spectrometry proteomics data. We show that even here the correlation can affect the FDR values and the number of proteins declared as critical.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Savita Venkataramani"", ids = ""33837679""); list(name = ""Dayanand N.

5963622a9cefc2e0c71015165c953f9e0eae4289,"Sex, Body Mass Index, and Dietary Fiber Intake Influence the Human Gut Microbiome","Increasing evidence suggests that the composition of the human gut microbiome is important in the etiology of human diseases; however, the personal factors that influence the gut microbiome composition are poorly characterized. Animal models point to sex hormone-related differentials in microbiome composition. In this study, we investigated the relationship of sex, body mass index (BMI) and dietary fiber intake with the gut microbiome in 82 humans. We sequenced fecal 16S rRNA genes by 454 FLX technology, then clustered and classified the reads to microbial genomes using the QIIME pipeline. Relationships of sex, BMI, and fiber intake with overall gut microbiome composition and specific taxon abundances were assessed by permutational MANOVA and multivariate logistic regression, respectively. We found that sex was associated with the gut microbiome composition overall (p=0.001). The gut microbiome in women was characterized by a lower abundance of Bacteroidetes (p=0.03). BMI (>25 kg/m2 vs. <25 kg/m2) was associated with the gut microbiome composition overall (p=0.05), and this relationship was strong in women (p=0.03) but not in men (p=0.29). Fiber from beans and from fruits and vegetables were associated, respectively, with greater abundance of Actinobacteria (p=0.006 and false discovery rate adjusted q=0.05) and Clostridia (p=0.009 and false discovery rate adjusted q=0.09). Our findings suggest that sex, BMI, and dietary fiber contribute to shaping the gut microbiome in humans. Better understanding of these relationships may have significant implications for gastrointestinal health and disease prevention.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christine Dominianni"", ids = ""5707220"");

b70bc7e4e08854f83110aa3e212fba06d0c7601d,Cardiovascular Risk Factors Associated With Blood Metabolite Concentrations and Their Alterations During a 4-Year Period in a Population-Based Cohort.,"BACKGROUND
The effects of lifestyle risk factors considered collectively on the human metabolism are to date unknown. We aim to investigate the association of these risk factors with metabolites and their changes during 4 years.


METHODS AND RESULTS
One hundred and sixty-three metabolites were measured in serum samples with the AbsoluteIDQ kit p150 (Biocrates) following a targeted metabolomics approach, in a population-based cohort of 1030 individuals, aged 45 to 83 years at baseline. We evaluated associations between metabolite concentrations (28 acylcarnitines, 14 amino acids, 9 lysophosphocholines, 72 phosphocholines, 10 sphingomyelins and sum of hexoses) and 5 lifestyle risk factors (body mass index [BMI], alcohol consumption, smoking, diet, and exercise). Multilevel or simple linear regression modeling adjusted for relevant covariates was used for the evaluation of cross-sectional or longitudinal associations, respectively; multiple testing correction was based on false discovery rate. BMI, alcohol consumption, and smoking were associated with lipid metabolism (reduced lyso- and acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholines and increased diacylphosphatidylcholines concentrations). Smoking showed positive associations with acylcarnitines, and BMI correlated inversely with nonessential amino acids. Fewer metabolites showed relative changes that were associated with baseline risk factors: increases in 5 different acyl-alkyl phosphatidylcholines were associated with lower alcohol consumption and BMI and with a healthier diet. Increased levels of tyrosine were associated with BMI. Sex-specific effects of smoking and BMI were found specifically related to acylcarnitine metabolism: in women higher BMI and in men more pack-years were associated with increases in acylcarnitines.


CONCLUSIONS
This study showed sex-specific effects of lifestyle risks factors on human metabolism and highlighted their long-term metabolic consequences.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Maria Elena Lacruz"", ids = ""84400134""); list(name = ""A.

6625ff73b82cf8dc8f533a8b78101341c42de0df,A note on the false discovery rate and inconsistent comparisons between experiments,"MOTIVATION
The false discovery rate (FDR) has been widely adopted to address the multiple comparisons issue in high-throughput experiments such as microarray gene-expression studies. However, while the FDR is quite useful as an approach to limit false discoveries within a single experiment, like other multiple comparison corrections it may be an inappropriate way to compare results across experiments. This article uses several examples based on gene-expression data to demonstrate the potential misinterpretations that can arise from using FDR to compare across experiments. Researchers should be aware of these pitfalls and wary of using FDR to compare experimental results. FDR should be augmented with other measures such as p-values and expression ratios. It is worth including standard error and variance information for meta-analyses and, if possible, the raw data for re-analyses. This is especially important for high-throughput studies because data are often re-used for different objectives, including comparing common elements across many experiments. No single error rate or data summary may be appropriate for all of the different objectives.",2008,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Roger Higdon"", ids = ""1735613""); list(name = ""Gerald van Belle"", ids = ""7937864""); list(name = ""Eugene Kolker"", ids = ""2823712"")",75bdfc843186ea55717c4c8a39f85f60dec27d73; 68d08bae86e9712d451729791cb90995afc59900; 25441dd28f1d3b12d11e09a7d88ba26e8e7346ea; 66217514f51ecb0b1088ff2308214e6827b54849; 9a5f06d3dce2557cbc4703c536ed21df43d128f7; 37311bd4c9cfadd9b93d6b39c55705a117de21d8; 14892686666a2388cb2b5bb056fe6c092a15eb07; c64c152a4a6c867aba9cc34609d156b2d71cc283; 2fc23cd7df24de84fe50624a4664c11a33e032f6; 9baf48485198253e7906ce1bc71f31113cc360ad; 1c8fa2b3dc20475e05154e2f369ec04b394312a8; 563a927ef04b4d9b190c0bb0e08ecddeb258b9b0; 2d4a5ecf60920b6864cdaf244e3355a2d76f1607; ffb3ac4a891bdbf1494fc777754c77dd78da8ac5; fcdc9fb1e88c40de12ad9481f0d580f803bc1582; 33bf84c13353f639c1a8cd96d20c4fda4d0db894,821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 3dcf692f8f01427c85bf4c594e07f68e3d77dac3; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; f7b886a3ccd077179c01c074f1351d9b9695fc3c; a175453ceff401c67ce503750418e66936331b06; bedd9b101bd358aec77993dbffe2e5495bcbf15e; a5e82ee0621f35bc3c1123dfbba32bad9932ef4d; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 296d56ff458de65282e2064e03efa7942427b7a7; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c5d8dd126d8a22f1a8b24c23dc04d75e6caebd71; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; 7cdae9ece0e94ad740189e7b328bbf6993b4c8d5; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; 81bf9b88d49678b4dde2f9a475ab036aeff79579; 938785b476ff9a12339abe0fea695da7263ddba6; 5457f90cd779b4004d47e9173e6f7c010878cb23; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 1d2e55d466f8d8d7fcd8f8225b67502da6031cd6; 9bc0574760fc30c74b077515385eeeba44c6f0f8,Bioinformatics,24 10,"

The mechanisms by which IRI predisposes to AR and CAN are unknown. We hypothesized that gene expression profiling of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)-affected kidney would identify how IRI predisposes to AR and CAN. Furthermore, we examined how current immunosuppressive drug molecular targets are altered by IRI. C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 30 (n = 3) or 60 (n = 3) minutes of bilateral kidney ischemia or sham surgery (n = 5). At 36 hour kidney tissue was collected and analyzed using Affymetrix 430MOEA (22626 genes) array and GC-RMA-SAM pipeline. Genes with the false discovery rate (q < 1%) and +/-50% fold change (FC) were considered affected by IRI. Genes coding for histocompatibility and antigen-presenting factors, calcineurin, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway-associated proteins were selected using Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. GO analysis identified 10 and 17 alloimmunity-related genes affected by IRI induced by 30 and 60 minutes of ischemia, respectively, including Traf6 (FC = 2.99) and H2-D1 (FC = 2.58). We also detected significant IRI genomic responses in calcineurin and mTOR pathways represented by Fkbp5 (FC = 4.18) and Fkbp1a (FC = 2.0), and Eif4ebp1 (FC = 16.8) and Akt1 (FC = 3.64), respectively. These data demonstrated that IRI up-regulates expression of several alloimmunity-associated genes, which can in turn enhance alloimune responses. Our discovery of IRI-induced up-regulation of genes associated with calcineurin and mTOR pathways are consistent with clinical observations that FK506 and Rapamycin can alter the course of DGF. Further validation and dissection of these pathways can lead to novel approaches by which improved management of early ""nonimmune"" transplant events can decrease susceptibility to more classic ""immune"" changes and CAN.",2006,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dmitry Grigoryev"", ids = ""152219093""); list(name = ""Mengdi Liu"", ids = ""3423497""); list(name = ""Christopher Cheadle"", ids = ""4253928""); list(name = ""Kathleen C.

42bb0a27b50342862f36d5c63bdcbff7bf2c4e4a,GWAS identifies novel SLE susceptibility genes and explains the association of the HLA region,"In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of individuals of European ancestry afflicted with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) the extensive utilization of imputation, step-wise multiple regression, lasso regularization and increasing study power by utilizing false discovery rate instead of a Bonferroni multiple test correction enabled us to identify 13 novel non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes and confirmed the association of four genes previously reported to be associated. Novel genes associated with SLE susceptibility included two transcription factors (EHF and MED1), two components of the NF-ÎºB pathway (RASSF2 and RNF114), one gene involved in adhesion and endothelial migration (CNTN6) and two genes involved in antigen presentation (BIN1 and SEC61G). In addition, the strongly significant association of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HLA region was assigned to HLA alleles and serotypes and deconvoluted into four primary signals. The novel SLE-associated genes point to new directions for both the diagnosis and treatment of this debilitating autoimmune disease.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Don L.

79cd48f9c5928ac8e3e55a705089a541854394bc,Evaluation of Second-Level Inference in fMRI Analysis,"We investigate the impact of decisions in the second-level (i.e., over subjects) inferential process in functional magnetic resonance imaging on (1) the balance between false positives and false negatives and on (2) the data-analytical stability, both proxies for the reproducibility of results. Second-level analysis based on a mass univariate approach typically consists of 3 phases. First, one proceeds via a general linear model for a test image that consists of pooled information from different subjects. We evaluate models that take into account first-level (within-subjects) variability and models that do not take into account this variability. Second, one proceeds via inference based on parametrical assumptions or via permutation-based inference. Third, we evaluate 3 commonly used procedures to address the multiple testing problem: familywise error rate correction, False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction, and a two-step procedure with minimal cluster size. Based on a simulation study and real data we find that the two-step procedure with minimal cluster size results in most stable results, followed by the familywise error rate correction. The FDR results in most variable results, for both permutation-based inference and parametrical inference.

7b1fb0f5de5dedf631aee63480372737a3f4b939,Trans-population analysis of genetic mechanisms of ethnic disparities in neuroblastoma survival.,"BACKGROUND
Black patients with neuroblastoma have a higher prevalence of high-risk disease and worse outcome than white patients. We sought to investigate the relationship between genetic variation and the disparities in survival observed in neuroblastoma.


METHODS
The analytic cohort was composed of 2709 patients. Principal components were used to assign patients to genomic ethnic clusters for survival analyses. Locus-specific ancestry was calculated for use in association analysis. The shorter spans of linkage disequilibrium in African populations may facilitate the fine mapping of causal variants in regions previously implicated by genome-wide association studies conducted primarily in patients of European descent. Thus, we evaluated 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms known to be associated with susceptibility to high-risk neuroblastoma from genome-wide association studies and all variants with highly divergent allele frequencies in reference African and European populations near the known susceptibility loci. All statistical tests were two-sided.


RESULTS
African genomic ancestry was associated with high-risk neuroblastoma (P = .007) and lower event-free survival (P = .04, hazard ratio = 1.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.05 to 1.80). rs1033069 within SPAG16 (sperm associated antigen 16) was determined to have higher risk allele frequency in the African reference population and statistically significant association with high-risk disease in patients of European and African ancestry (P = 6.42 Ã— 10(-5), false discovery rate < 0.0015) in the overall cohort. Multivariable analysis using an additive model demonstrated that the SPAG16 single nucleotide polymorphism contributes to the observed ethnic disparities in high-risk disease and survival.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study demonstrates that common genetic variation influences neuroblastoma phenotype and contributes to the ethnic disparities in survival observed and illustrates the value of trans-population mapping.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Eric R.

30ebb734da945f7675483a21d022dac3066365fc,SCIA: A Novel Gene Set Analysis Applicable to Data With Different Characteristics,"Gene set analysis is commonly used in functional enrichment and molecular pathway analyses. Most of the present methods are based on the competitive testing methods which assume each gene is independent of the others. However, the false discovery rates of competitive methods are amplified when they are applied to datasets with high inter-gene correlations. The self-contained testing methods could solve this problem, but there are other restrictions on data characteristics. Therefore, a statistically rigorous testing method applicable to different datasets with various complex characteristics is needed to obtain unbiased and comparable results. We propose a self-contained and competitive incorporated analysis (SCIA) to alleviate the bias caused by the limited application scope of existing gene set analysis methods. This is accomplished through a novel permutation strategy using a priori biological networks to selectively permute gene labels with different probabilities. In simulation studies, SCIA was compared with four representative analysis methods (GSEA, CAMERA, ROAST, and NES), and produced the best performance in both false discovery rate and sensitivity under most conditions with different parameter settings. Further, the KEGG pathway analysis on two real datasets of lung cancer showed that the results found by SCIA in both of the two datasets are much more than that of GSEA and most of them could be supported by literature. Overall, SCIA promisingly offers researchers more reliable and comparable results with different datasets.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yiqun Li"", ids = ""48514575""); list(name = ""Ying Wu"", ids = ""50118130""); list(name = ""Xiaohan Zhang"", ids = ""2682457""); list(name = ""Yunfan Bai"", ids = ""51193917""); list(name = ""Luqman Muhammad Akthar"", ids = ""147274840""); list(name = ""Xin Lu"", ids = ""145574672""); list(name = ""Ming Shi"", ids = ""143906511""); list(name = ""Jianxiang Zhao"", ids = ""13171617""); list(name = ""Qinghua Jiang"", ids = ""48209018""); list(name = ""Yu Li"", ids = ""50023961"")",,9616f36d11b0e83159716b5dfdd14cfc060a8ebc; 434d777b182cb8fe0e9fbd8fe2fa25826667210e; 9ea391ba553339d9bb69190c0e8bdba3d31f173e; 2a27c8e9550a93a4923fdeb026add08591678898; be98e7a9c5e4beb5aaf8ffbf98892f86835ca52a; efc61a7f31785638b13529fd1a1a9f59c057fa32; d2000f6dca86305e4a0f3b5ba0e3f460c296424a; 269a8428ea9d00a57792fe544ec2d784c476f3c0; a89579758b9ed13d3ba62c3b501dd727b179db44; 3ce045b9dca7200c7ca85549b2a7520a71c47710; 612c885364f37690f3c6c2e06a220c395ed51f59; 48d1193eb1526654fd48283f238d0181106f7bde; 216f9c47fe95738ad516e1713b15b815b2b8ed0b; 251e40a3502ff24f7b1ccdba4d8e50f7b3472727; 6a32d002c5c72363350fe50e09c56c7d28063447; fc1fd4702ddaf6e307e07919096257abb6799f63; 0a30b2362300dac72416aaab5fadcde22bd96555; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 59eb429a8a3a545efdb8f1f8382c43d02c683851; ab444ee02a24555ac55ab4dfd2a554c777e2d515; 0c94ae6856907dfa55e1027c27796b9c0779e263; 218d0afe6a17ef42b6cb923d0afa7c453b11b0e2; c60d03dbaafc028296856bc95cbcdc24b034e9f9; 045812b3b7796ceac18855d580a3fec7a5a80f66; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 37f47ce11ad87b569cab4acf6316df5dac7b433a; 9c07c51fffda2a237fd9f7c4c0b2bb3f63f9b255; 3ac42c9aaa395acdd1977f45cbdfe7db6b1f90a4; 8ae78abc2ad2580aca3c48f65e6659d3dc36bbe6; 058a3322467174f22971aad59ba6a8894f12bd5d; 4032cb28f726f41a9c93abfa434d0d7eee3a3850; 1c7ffc9b8da5873f06a3edc4448f80a01f174aeb; 186bc89648895a0a3b3ba88eb81f247c7d3fe4f1,Frontiers in Genetics,10,

Methods are needed to determine the significance of these changes while accounting for the enormous number of genes. Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) is a statistical technique for determining whether changes in gene expression are statistically significant. During the SAM procedure permutation of microarray data is considered to observe the changes in the overall expression level of data. With increasing number of permutations false discovery rate for gene set varies. In our work we took microarray data of Normal Glucose Tolerance (NGT), and Diabetes Mellitus (DM Type II). In this paper we proposed the result of permutations during execution of SAM algorithm.

Methods: We measured postural sway of 96 patients and 48 sex-/age-matched healthy controls by force platform in quiet standing (single-task (ST)) while performing the Stroop test (dual-task (DT)) to estimate the dual-task cost (DTC) of balance. In patient group, binary T2 and T1 lesion masks and their corresponding lesion volumes were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain. Normalized brain volume (NBV) was also estimated by SIENAX. Correlations between DTC and lesion location were determined by voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) analyses. Results: Patients had greater DTC than controls (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Among whole brain MRI metrics, only T1 lesion volume correlated with DTC (râ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.27; pâ€‰<â€‰0.01). However, VLSM analysis did not reveal any association with DTC using T1 lesion masks. By contrast, we found clusters of T2 lesions in distinct anatomical regions (anterior and superior corona radiata, bilaterally) to be correlated with DTC (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01 false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected). A multivariable stepwise regression model confirmed findings from VLSM analysis. NBV did not contribute to fit the model. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the CPI phenomenon in MS can be explained by disconnection along specific areas implicated in task-switching abilities and divided attention.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Serena Ruggieri"", ids = ""36547377""); list(name = ""Fulvia Fanelli"", ids = ""39329511""); list(name = ""Letizia Castelli"", ids = ""1924411""); list(name = ""Nikolaos Petsas"", ids = ""6787836""); list(name = ""Laura De Giglio"", ids = ""119629789""); list(name = ""Luca Prosperini"", ids = ""5585676"")",c9858ccc28985f6f12df946ca00930e9bc467272; 3c93b9e00b29755ccb116f74695b96bf2b402713; b2bc7635305a6d44bde17ff9d37280844c06ddc3; 553a8bd54138d38aee4c4f7f66ad6a511681ad8f; e4aaa1ecb41cd89afb56c99cae3a352c9fa3d59a; 91a92a7fbb978a4cb871114e85365ef558a922e1,5daa55635da46915b0daf1250ebe0fe171727358; 76a6c64beca766de1197756d9e1bb8ed0aef47ec; 33f9d9cdcea4327ca736105ff0e6dc2e443ab679; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; bac7090d762cc77658c774818fe2ac522278e858; 575ea113c421e542392543b179ce207547bd464d; fa3e452d68c6ff2b8c92ef213cebcd628aef9662; c98c0a48ca80fdb30e8caade64459a9cf14dab75; 45d9a76eca3a3b56b072929b95a6a3657ca7a10b; fe09fe6cb05ee2d8b6bde0468da1481f19a5c52a; 60c346831f659b58f96a69354ca3ebfe8a36c8d5; 9ffd382bf22ed93e7bdd529ebe52448b26ded868; aba5d526c2928977a9a6fd21f9e44107e56ad03b; a2358c130e161597a8ac5d78b0cb0d76a79cae66; f2a674fd93ebb7bca01fee5f912072335f553a41; 2c4254fa7cc05cbaf79d1a34a732167147186083; b5420ebe3bf71dd77c0ec91999eb063f2f527e94; bdce8fc35045cce5833350665452721e477f5e4c; 088550dd341f92f3eeee678b99963de374c9e451; 5a1dcadd0b48cdc266294c441ce2a50423b6c6fd; 19cfa6aceb1d928e55dc6ed18b8e0ae817cf025b; 52efb5c0ccbb82df4c720fe4308b93d98eb04adc; e86aa3b2b46968011dee493ad3fc2029a1dc6dbc; dc55507ab2ea82b3d738f902ba45f0245fb432c5; 74a38adc0034bbcec0f43553b1c8829f4f60b76e; 46d476b11f2fadb1487668468e5c36a3fe28af84; 216076a2697c2df13c8b0be565d6c039f0b0521d; a82cb3af1eb9c94cab7714ae049ecec1afde22fb; d4d2e45b514a35df2abe450f2d0ae278c5b2ec69; c53940d4fbd43d41b119fca8cc68434a371472ee; 7a46007578dcfe0da282f0a6b22a47ba8b4a629a; 7dd8de6d5a921c61a1f29c575920642da15866f0; 7a5eb51795f719612309160d3977b9b2e794e956; d295252063c96ecad04165a7471700a5fc55cf3f; 217c2da9f9e77834acad4e1dbde9c8ed49a193a1; cf1d949e5197753c304e2e57ef83d51543eb176f; 533ebd241801318f7d494012fd2e378e1a2667c0; acf9edfe0e78be8e4c9d5b206f87dc3476542d70; 6b84f155639f0c0b85a4e7c4b473d61932952f47; 8435500be0a029acbe2044149161f220250c4f3c; 697094dbd70fa2c38bb61f902f1375fd6772dda1; c66ed103a7784d95ec58210520b8017b31577ed8,"Multiple Sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)",24,653 - 662
9c10b17f7db4f43ae8046190e1fb02ff1dfb73a0,Gene4Denovo: an integrated database and analytic platform for de novo mutations in humans,"De novo mutations (DNMs) significantly contribute to sporadic diseases, particularly in neuropsychiatric disorders. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provide effective methods for detecting DNMs and prioritizing candidate genes. However, it remains a challenge for scientists, clinicians, and biologists to conveniently access and analyse data regarding DNMs and candidate genes from scattered publications. To fill the unmet need, we integrated 580 799 DNMs, including 30 060 coding DNMs detected by WES/WGS from 23 951 individuals across 24 phenotypes and prioritized a list of candidate genes with different degrees of statistical evidence, including 346 genes with false discovery rates <0.05. We then developed a database called Gene4Denovo (http://www.genemed.tech/gene4denovo/), which allowed these genetic data to be conveniently catalogued, searched, browsed, and analysed. In addition, Gene4Denovo integrated data from >60 genomic sources to provide comprehensive variant-level and gene-level annotation and information regarding the DNMs and candidate genes. Furthermore, Gene4Denovo provides end-users with limited bioinformatics skills to analyse their own genetic data, perform comprehensive annotation, and prioritize candidate genes using custom parameters. In conclusion, Gene4Denovo conveniently allows for the accelerated interpretation of DNM pathogenicity and the clinical implication of DNMs in humans.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Guihu Zhao"", ids = ""2222929"");

691f00a7d73db0765c4bae9be21956a2db8419b3,Vorinostat interferes with the signaling transduction pathway of T-cell receptor and synergizes with phosphoinositide-3 kinase inhibitors in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.,"BACKGROUND
Vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA), an inhibitor of class I and II histone deacetylases, has been approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In spite of emerging information on the effect of vorinostat in many types of cancer, little is yet known about this drug's mechanism of action, which is essential for its proper use in combination therapy. We investigated alterations in gene expression profile over time in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells treated with vorinostat. Subsequently, we evaluated inhibitors of PI3K, PIM and HSP90 as potential combination agents in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.


DESIGN AND METHODS
The genes significantly up- or down-regulated by vorinostat over different time periods (2-fold change, false discovery rate corrected P value<0.05) were selected using the short-time series expression miner. Cell viability was assessed in vitro in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells through measuring intracellular ATP content. Drug interactions were analyzed by the combination index method with CalcuSyn software.


RESULTS
The functional analysis suggests that vorinostat modifies signaling of T-cell receptor, MAPK, and JAK-STAT pathways. The phosphorylation studies of ZAP70 (Tyr319, Tyr493) and its downstream target AKT (Ser473) revealed that vorinostat inhibits phosphorylation of these kinases. With regards to effects on cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells, combining vorinostat with PI3K inhibitors resulted in synergy while cytotoxic antagonism was observed when vorinostat was combined with HSP90 inhibitor.


CONCLUSIONS
These results demonstrate the potential targets of vorinostat, underlining the importance of T-cell receptor signaling inhibition following vorinostat treatment.

Data from preclinical models supports the hypothesis that inhibition of MMP9 reduces local immune suppression, resulting in increased anti-tumor immunity. GS-5745 is a monoclonal antibody in clinical development that is a selective inhibitor of MMP9. The effect of GS-5745 + mFOLFOX6 (GS+chemo) on systemic biomarkers related to MMP9 activity, and immune suppression and activation, was explored in samples from patients in the gastric cancer cohort of the phase 1b study, NCT01803282. Immunoassay analysis of a set of serum proteins based on MMP9 biology and preclinical data (including 10 MMP9 substrates, 5 MMP/TIMPs and 25 inflammatory markers) are reported; exploratory analyses of a larger set will be presented. Total and GS-5745-free MMP9 was measured using a proprietary validated assay. Serum was collected at baseline and the start of every 28-day cycle from 40 gastric cancer patients treated with GS+chemo every 2 weeks. Biomarker area under the curve (AUC) of fold change over time was tested using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Multiple testing adjustment was based on false discovery rate. GS+chemo treatment resulted in a significant decrease of 3 MMP9 substrates in serum (TGFÎ², VEGF and CXCL5), with non-significant trends observed for 3 others (Kit-L, IL8 and CXCL1). MMP3, associated with MMP9 activation, was significantly increased by the combination treatment. MMP2 (an MMP9 homolog) and its binding partner, TIMP2, also showed an increased trend over time. All MMP9 was bound by GS-5745 after one cycle of GS+chemo treatment, but total MMP9 was unchanged. Analysis of biomarkers in the inflammatory set primarily identified trends; factors (10) related to immunosuppressive monocyte chemoattraction or activation decreased, whereas a few markers (3) of immune activation increased. TIMP-2 and TPO were identified by random forests as key markers of a potential baseline biomarker signature to distinguish responders from non-responders (best overall response: n=20 and 9, respectively) with 82.8% accuracy (AUC of ROC=0.83). This exploratory analysis of serum proteins in gastric cancer patients treated with GS+chemo identified pharmacodynamic changes in biomarkers related to MMP9 biology, immune suppression and innate inflammation, consistent with the hypothesis of MMP9-inhibition based upon preclinical models. Modulation of these systemic biomarkers may reflect inhibition of MMP9 activity in the tumor consequent with reduced suppression of anti-tumor immunity; however, conclusions from this study are limited by the fact that all patients were treated with GS+chemo. Confirmation of these findings will require a controlled prospective study. First two authors contributed equally.

ffb6f12ffd4be675404eba9a3a70474c6bac4502,Transcriptomic responses to Ivacaftor and prediction of Ivacaftor clinical responsiveness.,"Ivacaftor is a recently FDA-approved drug for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with at least one copy of the G511D mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The transcriptomic effect of Ivacaftor in CF patients remains unclear. We aim to examine if and how the transcriptome of patients is influenced by Ivacaftor treatment and to determine if these data allow prediction of Ivacaftor responsiveness. Our data originate from the GOAL-G551D Observational Study. We performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on PBMCs from 56 patients and compared the transcriptomic changes before and after Ivacaftor treatments. Consensus clustering method was employed to stratify patients into sub-groups based on clinical responses post treatment and we determined differences between subgroups in baseline gene expressions. A random forest model was built to predict Ivacaftor responsiveness. We identified 239 genes (false discovery rate < 0.1) that were significantly influenced by Ivacaftor in PBMC. The functions of these genes relate to cell differentiation, microbial infection, inflammation, Toll-like receptor signaling, and metabolism. We classified patients into ""good"" and ""moderate"" responders based on clinical response to Ivacraftor. We identified a panel of signature genes and built a statistical model for predicting CFTR modulator responsiveness. Despite a limited sample size, adequate prediction performance was achieved with an accuracy of 0.92. In conclusion, for the first time, the present study demonstrates profound transcriptomic impacts of Ivafactor in CF patients PBMCs and built a pilot statistical model for predicting the clinical responsiveness to Ivacaftor prior to treatment.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Tao Sun"", ids = ""39753539""); list(name = ""Zhe Sun"", ids = ""46555160""); list(name = ""Yale Jiang"", ids = ""66751421""); list(name = ""Annabel A.

In present study, overall intervention effects and the effects of using specific components were evaluated on vegetable, fruit, whole grain bread, and fish consumption, physical activity (PA), and smoking behavior.MethodsCancer survivors from 21 Dutch hospitals were recruited for a randomized controlled trial (Nâ€‰=â€‰432). Intervention effects after 6Â months were evaluated using multilevel linear regression analysis (complete cases and intention-to-treat). By conducting moderation analyses, additional effects of following the behavior-related modules were explored. The false discovery rate correction was applied to account for multiple testing.ResultsAfter 6Â months, 409 participants completed follow-up (dropoutâ€‰=â€‰11.5Â %). Indications were found that access to the intervention may result in increases of moderate PA and vegetable intake. The moderate PA increase was meaningful: 74.74Â min p/w higher increase in the intervention condition. Effect sizes of moderate PA (dâ€‰=â€‰.25) and vegetable (dâ€‰=â€‰.37) consumption were comparable to prior effective interventions. Visiting behavior-related modules affected moderate PA, fruit, and fish consumption. However, after correction for multiple testing, significances expired. No significant intervention effect was found on smoking behavior due to low numbers of smokers.Implications for Cancer SurvivorsAlthough the effectiveness was only shown only to a limited extend, this study provided several indications that this theory-based, comprehensive, and personalized eHealth intervention provides valuable content to complement usual cancer aftercare.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Iris M Kanera"", ids = ""6466271"");

a02aa93ce0ea1b59a1a18e1beb94ed6c0437ca94,An Application of the Bayesian Periodicity Test to Identify Diurnal Rhythm Genes in the Brain,"Biological systems are extremely dynamic and many aspects of cellular processes show rhythmic circadian patterns. Extracting such information from large expression data is challenging. In this work, we present a modified application of the Empirical Bayes periodicity test to identify genes with diurnal rhythmic behavior in two brain regions. The hypothalamus and amygdala gene expression data were generated from 100 BXD recombinant inbred mice during the day hours. Brain samples were collected over the course of two days. We first filtered the transcripts based on rank correlation at matched time points between day-1 and day-2. We then applied the proposed test of periodicity to identify diurnal rhythm genes in the full cohort and gender-specific sub-cohorts. In hypothalamus, at a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) of 0.01, we identified 15 transcripts with cyclic behavior in the full cohort, none, and 53 transcripts in the female and male cohort, respectively. Similarly, in amygdala, we identified 58 diurnal rhythm genes in the full cohort, and 1 and 28 in the female and male cohorts, respectively. In conclusion, we present a modified version of the empirical Bayes periodicity test to detect periodic expression patterns. Our results demonstrate that this approach can capture cyclic patterns from relatively noisy expression data sets.",2020,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mehmet Kocak"", ids = ""143859537""); list(name = ""Khyobeni Mozhui"", ids = ""3149365"")",b24ffa922b783b280b7d61097b2021e07e282e09,c31482c9962cab74d8dd0da2561298130b5c1fb8; 610d23da60d74617e20b07ce9678e11768ddf345; f5f9746576929e187ecfbeddc2fe45968440cb6a; 2ef4495870ffd1d09cde00a62bf454d531d08196; 2d563a6f153611c5bd19ed0738f1f94a521a2598; 3dde23793fb01b2c585960d554c9b96ec4d6530c; 096841f39dbaae4abad6939a2694eafef92ef80c; 52a655c2ac3d9b88f94047a72a5eeb7c81948442; 34ce8dd3af2732873f5eacaef364be60e593e492; d0183bd780fd8bc14a3c519ffcbdfb24a04c7a7d; 7ad99720f4e91da1bc78d5fcaed1e13cef8b018b; 5c4b33dea00608adb7256414845abc82c4f263ab; 958f875831fb45ff6c7414c781af074667e2c4f6; 7c927f1e954eeae363d00499be209260f1d9513d; 4e71a9eeb2834f1cc18b1197286446d9375c1fed; 4fddf109913bd949686757b28dacd9a21f52f17e; d1ab6763c3c52196306f0bdc230aade608a2ac03; af781414664989b069149cb03c9a0921f37ac0a5; c0d331d7f806d89dddb71a177ee37792f2ae7c01; ae44a50149ebe90e0e364fef47fbf9c0b6e63eea; a5a52d98cf6ad6d3e9994abce93107b620f3f8dc; e101058bd0a41fa8c7e57cc983e5307de9db97e8; 1639802078ae4d63eca9873d79b680983abea22b; 28972beca9b65e11ded75c5a2418c219548f60ec; 6019c9de50b29fb9f00b55801f3208c98281c637; 7d574c505146ef1e7e047853fabc2e04e868fe28; 364e6f6b0931f3822ff570282bb981c461db0621; 98842c1ea99266e3294339cb9a64acd5401974e9; d85428958fec50711469f2405ef9adffe5b6e587; d53b2987dede32ffdc498acd6a77f51ad82200c8; aac6d2a51ba8eda359860a0cd1634e6d925d290f; 7ef32f438ed0201c30afee1b20a66a8e38ade5a9; cae10b062c729c6d2d3efbab6c89d133ca83ef20; b3c4a29324f48fc445e57a630acf7c6c6621bb50; 29385138df3f94af48daac681de2b5d0a20ffd8c; f51baf93c96e27a087a543a032ffbc8b2f12d7bf; a8c1f29e9385756e87a1e289947841ea96036f37,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,17,47-55
f731f5810b79982cdd5da5330ee98e54f9c34be4,Improving false discovery rate estimation,"MOTIVATION
Recent attempts to account for multiple testing in the analysis of microarray data have focused on controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). However, rigorous control of the FDR at a preselected level is often impractical. Consequently, it has been suggested to use the q-value as an estimate of the proportion of false discoveries among a set of significant findings. However, such an interpretation of the q-value may be unwarranted considering that the q-value is based on an unstable estimator of the positive FDR (pFDR). Another method proposes estimating the FDR by modeling p-values as arising from a beta-uniform mixture (BUM) distribution. Unfortunately, the BUM approach is reliable only in settings where the assumed model accurately represents the actual distribution of p-values.


METHODS
A method called the spacings LOESS histogram (SPLOSH) is proposed for estimating the conditional FDR (cFDR), the expected proportion of false positives conditioned on having k 'significant' findings. SPLOSH is designed to be more stable than the q-value and applicable in a wider variety of settings than BUM.


RESULTS
In a simulation study and data analysis example, SPLOSH exhibits the desired characteristics relative to the q-value and BUM.

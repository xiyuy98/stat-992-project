bf78a18dd547155c83eda81de3fb75321ef143e5,False discovery rate estimation for frequentist pharmacovigilance signal detection methods.,"Pharmacovigilance systems aim at early detection of adverse effects of marketed drugs. They maintain large spontaneous reporting databases for which several automatic signaling methods have been developed. One limit of those methods is that the decision rules for the signal generation are based on arbitrary thresholds. In this article, we propose a new signal-generation procedure. The decision criterion is formulated in terms of a critical region for the P-values resulting from the reporting odds ratio method as well as from the Fisher's exact test. For the latter, we also study the use of mid-P-values. The critical region is defined by the false discovery rate, which can be estimated by adapting the P-values mixture model based procedures to one-sided tests. The methodology is mainly illustrated with the location-based estimator procedure. It is studied through a large simulation study and applied to the French pharmacovigilance database.",2010,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""IsmaÃ¯l Ahmed"", ids = ""2802717""); list(name = ""CÃ©dric Dalmasso"", ids = ""2985460""); list(name = ""FranÃ§oise Haramburu"", ids = ""5065158""); list(name = ""Frantz Thiessard"", ids = ""2188028""); list(name = ""Philippe BroÃ«t"", ids = ""3170825""); list(name = ""Pascale Tubert-Bitter"", ids = ""1398734189"")",cd4749c47a815a487db3ca5d6c094b70177af366; d8b24b1be95d7cfac83664699d9d54c1567efc1a; 383516a60405dba3cc53da4cc24fcb3319b8cc0d; 1668999083ae5388332b44b1417dcbe4b9388ba4; ce96bb13c2eec47e375574709b38820c38bf9626; 94ea0025084f0b228882338d27ab9b1dddb1d92c; d58a9763166224475dea9727ddd0c39643f6d2d8; b20f1e86a44acef72735c99bbed5b10a643f222f; 3e7ad7d1079bb21634e809072e5dc3153485d1fd; 2f4d0f1b26500375c55a83855e2ce0b3f665229c; acf30d8aea79533d2501145ff8e10dd3049c41e9; 482f1f5daf61ba1cd97a958c6b2e5a35ddb5708e; dd7bfa6efeb4d8a85971af7dc31e8ace434729c8; fafbff14c53f253db87d08a29e06e9bd7af2d8c0; 7b59b9898d07b68e8d0147a2004a6433a536b25a; eb289c307860cc4e608b0064c024827a31d52d5f; 2c61b3444ca9f9064042659e12f9051a763dba3b; 06f5b70094e722378477ee028e970f6318848c35; 5e91840f03daa1dd8f2805a3ae6a9fa976500eb5; 8a099a8671aaa21374cc545967e5e33352b3d0ac; 432dfaf3384bad3e71d77daafe2bfd131708673d; 329d3fa52d6152e07515ce0367793617b804bfa7; 23a1ec9580b36b842e7d240aa05a6c8ce28e07be; 39329777e22134b8be7876981fccdcce45bf7403; c4465436014be9baae12aeee01880ff4c9571e8a; f713fd54b04495708fcfa55727fa2db028ffefbe; 7419376551c20fc88f524cb08e32aff7d348b90f; 515fbba3cf46dbc96156ac7dde0a3e8fe7fcfe7e; 18c1f2ffa128488bdce312e8d188b839c3d66b6c; 263d3e0869a0abf2c45fc00737c790237410f51f; d401626b8887e7a12961fd2c44101366d7128402; cbf862a44b0ac4f999e502425c042ce9f94f0943; 7e2a46a2b377e31c28776fe09e0089ba396db01d; b1b08d3c00098cc58a78f7aa27cab577ca08443e; b94daff29a50eed08675fdb279833eb7274cf4bb; 40feeefb7ae780a3175573c338a51dd59cc8413b,,Biometrics,66 1,"

940672789d1d4b7d7fbe71ac114c2c1205e732bf,Colonic mucosal and exfoliome transcriptomic profiling and fecal microbiome response to a flaxseed lignan extract intervention in humans.,"BACKGROUND
Microbial metabolism of lignans from high-fiber plant foods produces bioactive enterolignans, such as enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END). Enterolignan exposure influences cellular pathways important to cancer risk and is associated with reduced colon tumorigenesis in animal models and lower colorectal cancer risk in humans.


OBJECTIVES
The aim of this study was to test the effects of a flaxseed lignan supplement (50 mg secoisolariciresinol diglucoside/d) compared with placebo on host gene expression in colon biopsies and exfoliated colonocyte RNA in feces and fecal microbial community composition, and to compare responses in relation to ENL excretion.


METHODS
We conducted a 2-period randomized, crossover intervention in 42 healthy men and women (20-45 y). We used RNA-seq to measure differentially expressed (DE) genes in colonic mucosa and fecal exfoliated cells through the use of edgeR and functional analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. We used 16S ribosomal RNA gene (V1-V3) analysis to characterize the fecal microbiome, and measured END and ENL in 24-h urine samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.


RESULTS
We detected 32 DE genes (false discovery rate <0.05) in the exfoliome, but none in the mucosal biopsies, in response to 60 d of lignan supplement compared with placebo. Statistically significant associations were detected between ENL excretion and fecal microbiome measured at baseline and at the end of the intervention periods. Further, we detected DE genes in colonic mucosa and exfoliome between low- and high-ENL excreters. Analysis of biopsy samples indicated that several anti-inflammatory upstream regulators, including transforming growth factor Î² and interleukin 10 receptor, were suppressed in low-ENL excreters. Complementary analyses in exfoliated cells also suggested that low-ENL excreters may be predisposed to proinflammatory cellular events due to upregulation of nuclear transcription factor ÎºB and NOS2, and an inhibition of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ network.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that ENL or other activities of the associated gut microbial consortia may modulate response to a dietary lignan intervention. This has important implications for dietary recommendations and chemoprevention strategies.

37051e1b193912fb61f2732811b2c0b3adc69e28,DiffNetFDR: differential network analysis with false discovery rate control,"Summary
To identify biological network rewiring under different conditions, we develop a user-friendly R package, named DiffNetFDR, to implement two methods developed for testing the difference in different Gaussian graphical models. Compared to existing tools, our methods have the following features: (i) they are based on Gaussian graphical models which can capture the changes of conditional dependencies; (ii) they determine the tuning parameters in a data-driven manner; (iii) they take a multiple testing procedure to control the overall false discovery rate; and (iv) our approach defines the differential network based on partial correlation coefficients so that the spurious differential edges caused by the variants of conditional variances can be excluded. We also develop a Shiny application to provide easier analysis and visualization. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of our methods. We also apply our methods to two real gene expression datasets. The effectiveness of our methods is validated by the biological significance of the identified differential networks.

d6e5097c22ba06d56dfeee6c8c3ba1023757c653,Associations between cruciferous vegetable intake and selected biomarkers among women scheduled for breast biopsies.,"OBJECTIVE
To examine the relationship between dietary cruciferous vegetable intake and selected tumour biomarkers for histone acetylation (H3K9ac, H3K18ac, HDAC3 and HDAC6), proliferation (Ki-67) and cell-cycle regulation (p21) from breast tissue.


DESIGN
The study used baseline data of women recruited to participate in a clinical trial of sulforaphane supplement. Dietary cruciferous vegetable intake was collected through a validated Arizona Cruciferous Vegetable Intake Questionnaire. Breast tissue was obtained from biopsy samples. Spearman correlations were calculated between intake of specific cruciferous vegetables and biomarkers. Tissue biomarkers were log2-transformed to obtain approximate normality. Linear regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between cruciferous vegetable intake and biomarkers adjusting for age and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. False discovery rate (FDR) was used to account for multiple comparisons.


SETTING
Clinical trial baseline.


SUBJECTS
Fifty-four women who had abnormal mammogram findings and were scheduled for breast biopsy.


RESULTS
Mean intake of total cruciferous vegetables from all food sources was 81Â·7 (sd 57Â·3) g/d. Mean urinary total sulforaphane metabolites was 0Â·08 (sd 0Â·07) Âµm/mm creatinine. Total cruciferous vegetable intake was inversely associated with Ki-67 protein expression in breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) tissue (Î²=-0Â·004; se=0Â·001; FDR q value=0Â·03), but not in benign or invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tissue. No association was found for other biomarkers measured (HDAC3, HDAC6, H3K9, H3K18 and p21) in all tissues examined (benign, DCIS and IDC).


CONCLUSIONS
The present study sought to provide additional evidence for the potential role of sulforaphane in histone acetylation and cell proliferation. Here, we report that total cruciferous vegetable intake is associated with decreased cell proliferation in breast DCIS tissue.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhenzhen Zhang"", ids = ""3101954""); list(name = ""Lauren Lee Atwell"", ids = ""6705264""); list(name = ""Paige E.

Although the genetic structure of V. inaequalis populations has been investigated in detail, genomic features underlying these subdivisions remain poorly understood. Here, we report whole genome sequencing of 87 Venturia strains that represent each species and each population within V. inaequalis We present a PacBio genome assembly for the V. inaequalis EU-B04 reference isolate. The size of selected genomes was determined by flow cytometry, and varied from 45 to 93 Mb. Genome assemblies of V. inaequalis and V. aucupariae contain a high content of transposable elements (TEs), most of which belong to the Gypsy or Copia LTR superfamilies and have been inactivated by Repeat-Induced Point mutations. The reference assembly of V. inaequalis presents a mosaic structure of GC-equilibrated regions that mainly contain predicted genes and AT-rich regions, mainly composed of TEs. Six pairs of strains were identified as clones. Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis between these clones revealed a high number of SNPs that are mostly located in AT-rich regions due to misalignments and allowed determining a false discovery rate.

87708589a141c7945491d95433bbc8c35dd19561,Large-scale prediction of human kinase-inhibitor interactions using protein sequences and molecular topological structures.,"The kinase family is one of the largest target families in the human genome. The family's key function in signal transduction for all organisms makes it a very attractive target class for the therapeutic interventions in many diseases states such as cancer, diabetes, inflammation and arthritis. A first step toward accelerating kinase drug discovery process is to fast identify whether a chemical and a kinase interact or not. Experimentally, these interactions can be identified by in vitro binding assay - an expensive and laborious procedure that is not applicable on a large scale. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop statistically efficient approaches for identifying kinase-inhibitor interactions. For the first time, the quantitative binding affinities of kinase-inhibitor pairs are differentiated as a measurement to define if an inhibitor interacts with a kinase, and then a chemogenomics framework using an unbiased set of general integrated features (drug descriptors and protein descriptors) and random forest (RF) is employed to construct a predictive model which can accurately classify kinase-inhibitor pairs. Our results show that RF with integrated features gave prediction accuracy of 93.76%, sensitivity of 92.26%, and specificity of 95.27%, respectively. The results are superior to those by only considering two separated spaces (chemical space and protein space), demonstrating that these integrated features contribute cooperatively. Based on the constructed model, we provided a high confidence list of drug-target associations for subsequent experimental investigation guidance at a low false discovery rate.",2013,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Dongsheng Cao"", ids = ""40035219""); list(name = ""Guang-hua Zhou"", ids = ""3722741""); list(name = ""Shao Liu"", ids = ""4790986""); list(name = ""Liu-Xia Zhang"", ids = ""4747171""); list(name = ""Qing-Song Xu"", ids = ""6464609""); list(name = ""Min He"", ids = ""144852496""); list(name = ""Yi-Zeng Liang"", ids = ""2325966"")",aae50ee01d1cf311f95dff967b2e76da510d3daf; 0fe34d814317b3bb6d6382cd0d93f94e5747af43; 909f17c09a482a71e70ea3a567b6c47f001663ca; 29c43bd79cb35aa6e9de81f62b79441c65d14531; 2802053928ed6a0ea1d996749abcdbe67d9d318a; 1657d751300bdb95ebf4478fe2801f34e29f8266; 9db20cc9d067a2fcb1952fd78036e280c1d9c360; 899993a90c133f51692c844e7419656e46197450; e2dba92c3a3bd695ba87f0d28be1e195b26485c5; 734efb3801885bad6a627e4ef5b4afd3ff53f948,,Analytica chimica acta,792,"

To develop and evaluate a sliding-window convolutional neural network (CNN) for radioactive seed identification in MRI of the prostate after permanent implant brachytherapy.


METHODS
Sixty-eight patients underwent prostate cancer low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy using radioactive seeds stranded with positive contrast MR-signal seed markers and were scanned using a balanced steady-state free precession pulse sequence with and without an endorectal coil (ERC). A sliding-window CNN algorithm (SeedNet) was developed to scan the prostate images using 3D sub-windows and to identify the implanted radioactive seeds. The algorithm was trained on sub-windows extracted from 18 patient images. Seed detection performance was evaluated by computing precision, recall, F1 -score, false discovery rate, and false-negative rate. Seed localization performance was evaluated by computing the RMS error (RMSE) between the manually identified and algorithm-inferred seed locations. SeedNet was implemented into a clinical software package and evaluated on sub-windows extracted from 40 test patients.


RESULTS
SeedNet achieved 97.6 Â± 2.2% recall and 97.2 Â± 1.9% precision for radioactive seed detection and 0.19 Â± 0.04 mm RMSE for seed localization in the images acquired with an ERC. Without the ERC, the recall remained high, but the false-positive rate increased; the RMSE of the seed locations increased marginally. The clinical integration of SeedNet slightly increased the run-time, but the overall run-time was still low.


CONCLUSION
SeedNet can be used to perform automated radioactive seed identification in prostate MRI after LDR brachytherapy. Image quality improvement through pulse sequence optimization is expected to improve SeedNet's performance when imaging without an ERC.",2019,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Jeremiah W Sanders"", ids = ""48981876""); list(name = ""Steven J Frank"", ids = ""2185395""); list(name = ""Rajat J.

ab2aaeda34f130ff3e188bb7e0728126875a3a38,Poisson approximation for significance in genome-wide ChIP-chip tiling arrays,"MOTIVATION
A genome-wide ChIP-chip tiling array study requires millions of simultaneous comparisons of hybridization for significance. Controlling the false positive rate in genome-wide tiling array studies is very important, because the number of computationally identified regions can easily go beyond the capability of experimental verification. No accurate and efficient method exists for evaluating statistical significance in tiling arrays. The Bonferroni method is overly conservative and the permutation test is time consuming for genome-wide studies.


RESULT
Motivated by the Poisson clumping heuristic, we propose an accurate and efficient method for evaluating statistical significance in genome-wide ChIP-chip tiling arrays. The method works accurately for any large number of multiple comparisons, and the computational cost for evaluating P-values does not increase with the total number of tests. Based on a moving window approach, we demonstrate how to combine results using various window sizes to increase the detection power while maintaining a specified type I error rate. We further introduce a new false discovery rate control that is more appropriate in measuring the false proportion of binding intervals in tiling array analysis. Our method is general and can be applied to many large-scale genomic and genetic studies.

ffafb57c1a25db139329fa75de08545ffe4acdd0,Genetic variants in the vitamin D pathway and breast cancer disease-free survival.,"Epidemiological studies have investigated the association between vitamin D pathway genes and breast cancer risk; however, little is known about the association between vitamin D pathway genes and breast cancer prognosis. In a retrospective cohort of 1029 patients with early-stage breast cancer, we analyzed the association between 106 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight vitamin D pathway genes and breast cancer disease-free survival (DFS) using Cox regression analysis adjusted for known prognostic variables. Using a false discovery rate of 10%, six intronic SNPs were significantly associated with poorer DFS: retinoid-X receptor alpha (RXRA) SNPs (rs881658, rs11185659, rs10881583, rs881657 and rs7864987) and plasminogen activator and urokinase receptor (PLAUR) SNP (rs4251864). Treatment received (no systemic therapy, hormone therapy alone or chemotherapy) was an effect modifier of the RXRA SNPs association with DFS (P < 0.05); therefore, we stratified further analysis by treatment group. Among patients who did not receive systemic therapy, RXRA SNP [rs10881583 (P = 0.02)] was associated with poorer DFS, and among patients who received chemotherapy, RXRA SNPs (rs881658, rs11185659, rs10881583, rs881657 and rs7864987) were associated with poorer DFS (P < 0.001 for all SNPs). However, RXRA SNPs: rs10881583 (P < 0.001) and rs881657 (P = 0.02) were associated with improved DFS in patients treated with hormone therapy alone. Our results suggest that SNPs in the RXRA and PLAUR genes in the vitamin D pathway may contribute to breast cancer DFS. In particular, SNPs in RXRA may predict for poorer or improved DFS in patients, according to type of systemic treatment received. If validated, these markers could be used for risk stratification of breast cancer patients.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mala Pande"", ids = ""144382781""); list(name = ""Patricia A.

62ee2cbe1aa0c36e42384498603d0360d0a98dc7,Gene expression profiling of choline-deprived neural precursor cells isolated from mouse brain.,"Choline is an essential nutrient and an important methyl donor. Choline deficiency alters fetal development of the hippocampus in rodents and these changes are associated with decreased memory function lasting throughout life. Also, choline deficiency alters global and gene-specific DNA methylation in several models. This gene expression profiling study describes changes in cortical neural precursor cells from embryonic day 14 mice, after 48 h of exposure to a choline-deficient medium. Using Significance Analysis of Microarrays, we found the expression of 1003 genes to be significantly changed (from a total of 16,000 total genes spotted on the array), with a false discovery rate below 5%. A total of 846 genes were overexpressed while 157 were underexpressed. Classification by gene ontology revealed that 331 of these genes modulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, neuronal and glial differentiation, methyl metabolism, and calcium-binding protein classes. Twenty-seven genes that had changed expression have previously been reported to be regulated by promoter or intron methylation. These findings support our previous work suggesting that choline deficiency decreases the proliferation of neural precursors and possibly increases premature neuronal differentiation and apoptosis.",2005,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mihai D.

4b67dc3d28580ff7a8c46d81134891ad065e6708,Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Impact of Bed Rest on Maternal and Fetal Outcomes in Women with Preterm Premature Rupture of the Membranes.,"OBJECTIVES
Preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) is spontaneous rupture of membranes before 37 weeks' gestation before the onset of labor. The standard of care is inpatient management with antibiotics and monitoring. Bed rest has not been shown to be beneficial in the setting of PPROM and has adverse maternal effects. We conducted a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) to determine the feasibility of recruitment for an RCT of this nature and obtain estimates of the frequency of maternal and neonatal outcomes.


STUDY DESIGN
Patients who were diagnosed with PPROMâ€‰<â€‰34 weeks gestational age were randomized to bed rest versus activity in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups wore pedometers and kept activity logs. Maternal demographic and obstetric data and neonatal outcomes were collected and compared between groups using chi-square and Fisher exact tests. Latency was evaluated with log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier analysis.


RESULTS
In this study, 36 women were enrolled and randomized; 1 patient withdrew. Complete data were available for 21 subjects. In univariable analysis, women in the activity group had a nonsignificantly shorter latency time than the bed rest group (median 6.0 vs. 8.5 days). Neonatal outcomes were similar between groups. Using log-rank sum analysis, neonates born to mothers in the activity group were more likely to develop necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) than in the control group (24 vs. 0%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.05); this difference was not significant after false discovery rate correction (pâ€‰=â€‰0.80).


CONCLUSION
This is the first randomized controlled study to evaluate bed rest versus normal activity in the setting of PPROMâ€‰<â€‰34 weeks. This study demonstrates a nonsignificant increase in latency to delivery on bed rest and possible increase in NEC in the activity group; the mechanism remains unclear. We would recommend a larger RCT to better clarify these findings.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Catherine A Bigelow"", ids = ""47217184""); list(name = ""Stephanie H.

a427d1008727dfcea5d759355e05d5825de4216a,Bacterial and cytokine mixtures predict the length of gestation and are associated with miRNA expression in the cervix.,"AIM
Bacterial vaginosis may lead to preterm birth through epigenetic programming of the inflammatory response, specifically via miRNA expression.


METHODS
We quantified bacterial 16S rRNA, cytokine mRNA and 800 miRNA from cervical swabs obtained from 80 women at 16-19 weeks' gestation. We generated bacterial and cytokine indices using weighted quantile sum regression and examined associations with miRNA and gestational age at delivery.


RESULTS & DISCUSSION
Each decile of the bacterial and cytokine indices was associated with shorter gestations (p < 0.005). The bacterial index was associated with miR-494, 371a, 4286, 185, 320e, 888 and 23a (p < 0.05). miR-494 remained significant after false discovery rate correction (q < 0.1). The cytokine index was associated with 27 miRNAs (p < 0.05; q < 0.01).


CONCLUSION
Future investigation into the role of bacterial vaginosis- and inflammation-associated miRNA and preterm birth is warranted.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alison P.

165a562c4659cb03b504301454784b8265d7b8f8,Controlling the proportion of false positives in multiple dependent tests.,"Genome scan mapping experiments involve multiple tests of significance. Thus, controlling the error rate in such experiments is important. Simple extension of classical concepts results in attempts to control the genomewise error rate (GWER), i.e., the probability of even a single false positive among all tests. This results in very stringent comparisonwise error rates (CWER) and, consequently, low experimental power. We here present an approach based on controlling the proportion of false positives (PFP) among all positive test results. The CWER needed to attain a desired PFP level does not depend on the correlation among the tests or on the number of tests as in other approaches. To estimate the PFP it is necessary to estimate the proportion of true null hypotheses. Here we show how this can be estimated directly from experimental results. The PFP approach is similar to the false discovery rate (FDR) and positive false discovery rate (pFDR) approaches. For a fixed CWER, we have estimated PFP, FDR, pFDR, and GWER through simulation under a variety of models to illustrate practical and philosophical similarities and differences among the methods.",2004,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Rohan L.

e891ae520083aac507191472f6236caf807d3343,Global Analysis of Transcriptional Expression in Mice Exposed to Intermediate Frequency Magnetic Fields Utilized for Wireless Power Transfer Systems,"BACKGROUND
Intermediate frequency magnetic fields (IF-MFs) at around 85 kHz are a component of wireless power transfer systems used for charging electrical vehicles. However, limited data exist on the potential health effects of IF-MFs. We performed a comprehensive analysis of transcriptional expression in mice after IF-MF exposure.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We developed an IF-MF exposure system to generate a high magnetic flux density (25.3 mT). The system can expose the IF-MF for a mouse whole-body without considering thermal effects. After 10 days (1 h/day) of exposure, a comprehensive expression analysis was performed using microarray data from both the brain and liver.


RESULTS
No significant differences in transcriptional expression were detected in the 35,240 probe-sets when controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) under a fold change cutoff >1.5. However, several differential expressions were detected without FDR-adjustment, but these were not confirmed by RT-PCR analysis.


CONCLUSIONS

High risk is best captured by cellular and molecular genetic features. Objective: to determine whether predictive power of baseline GEP and metaphase cytogenetic abnormalities (CA) could be improved by availability of GEP data obtained 48hr after single agent D or T, pre-therapy. A total of 668 patients were enrolled on TT2, 323 randomized to T and 345 without T (ASCO 05). When randomized to T/no T, Baseline and 48 hr GEP samples were obtained from 32/41 receiving a test dose of T/D vs 10/14 receiving full VAD+T/VAD regimen. A total of 97 baseline/early treatment GEP pairs were analyzed. Combined baseline expression and 48hr expression changes of 151 genes predicted EFS at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 10%. The table compares baseline EFS high-risk dysregulation to the direction of 48 hour changes, confering improved EFS. Decreases over 48 hours are associated with improved EFS in 74 of 78 genes (upregulated expression confers poor survival at baseline). In the remaining 4, perturbation in the direction of an additional increase may be a marker of early response. With EFS-associated genes, we trained 15 EFS prediction models using baseline expression and 15 prediction models using the change in expression between baseline and 48 hours. Training sets were random splits of 97 patients and baseline and change models separately predicted an EFS risk index in the remaining validation patients (standardized to a variance of 1). Risk indices were compared to an indicator of cytogenetic abnormalities (CA) among validation patients using multivariate proportional hazards analyses. The table shows median hazard ratios and p-values for competing predictors in 15 validation sets. Without cytogenetics, combined GEP baseline and change indices were significant predictors in all 15 validation sets (median combined P-value of 0.002). The table shows median performing GEP model of 15 in a multivariate analysis including cytogenetics for all 97 patients. 48 hour changes in gene expression in newly diagnosed myeloma patients can significantly predict EFS in validated prediction models, alone and in combination with baseline GEP. After adjustment for baseline and 48-hour GEP change indices, metaphase cytogenetics is no longer a significant predictor in independent patient samples.",2005,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bart Burington"", ids = ""46605342""); list(name = ""John D.

We developed a statistical procedure to identify expression biomarkers for treatment subtype classification by constructing an F-statistic based on Henderson method III. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to examine the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method. Simulation results showed that our method could provide satisfying power of identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with false discovery rate (FDR) lower than the given type I error rate. In addition, we analyzed a leukemia dataset collected from 38 leukemia patients with 27 samples diagnosed as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 11 samples as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We compared our results with those from the methods of significance analysis of microarray (SAM) and microarray analysis of variance (MAANOVA).

SAS has identified several different methods to adjust p-values for multiple testing. To compare the effect of these methods, an animal health dataset that deals with the treatment of cattle lice was examined. Clinical trials were conducted in Illinois and Wisconsin to evaluate the efficacy of two formulations of a new product Spinosad, two commercially available positive controls, and an untreated negative control. A baseline lice count was recorded prior to the treatment. After treatment, weekly measurements of lice counts were taken for 8 weeks. Counts of 4 lice species were recorded separately. A linear mixed model analysis was conducted for each species of lice after transforming the counts with a natural logarithm transformation. Simple contrasts between treatment groups at each week were performed. Treatment differences were also compared using 5 multiple testing methods: Bonferroni, Sidak, Holmâ€™s step-down Bonferroni, Hochberg's step-up Bonferroni, and false discovery rate. Seventy-one out of 96 simple tests showed significant differences among the treatment groups. The five multiple testing methods confirmed only 48-67 significances out of the 96 tests. Comparatively, Bonferroni and Sidak methods provided similar and the most conservative multiplicity test results, i.e. fewest significant differences. The Holmâ€™s step-down and Hochberg's step-up Bonferroni methods provided similar but less conservative results. Finally, the false discovery rate method provided the least conservative results.",2006,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Zhanglin Cui"", ids = ""47217084""); list(name = ""Daniel H.

9d4e77b6d2487bdd6edcd9826ca039a4341fdc3d,Controlling the FDR in variable selection via multiple knockoffs,"Barber and Candes recently introduced a feature selection method called knockoff+ that controls the false discovery rate (FDR) among the selected features in the classical linear regression problem. Knockoff+ uses the competition between the original features and artificially created knockoff features to control the FDR [1]. We generalize Barber and Candes' knockoff construction to generate multiple knockoffs and use those in conjunction with a recently developed general framework for multiple competition-based FDR control [9]. 
We prove that using our initial multiple-knockoff construction the combined procedure rigorously controls the FDR in the finite sample setting. Because this construction has a somewhat limited utility we introduce a heuristic we call ""batching"" which significantly improves the power of our multiple-knockoff procedures. 
Finally, we combine the batched knockoffs with a new context-dependent resampling scheme that replaces the generic resampling scheme used in the general multiple-competition setup. We show using simulations that the resulting ""multi-knockoff-select"" procedure empirically controls the FDR in the finite setting of the variable selection problem while often delivering substantially more power than knockoff+.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Kristen Emery"", ids = ""143862568""); list(name = ""Uri Keich"", ids = ""47308722"")",,3fc17a36e2bec28396fd17c1ec2288d817564565; c283bf27e550b8d82ca84923fd846bf8eabf2bd6; 905e264286c1b05a1f802659bb075a7cd5274492; b9efffc63f81bf3f6cb6357ddc15e9cd9da75d16; 16b3c8f6f1dffd31271c59c11e17241e51377d68; 067c511443cadcbdf8efbf5ae76fc664020d3442; a5abe31321107a7e3b000899bf71ba26421ddb76; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; 7bc5bc2a27000756a359533aa7f3f3da4a5d7b1c; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 784d5c09cafeaea5a8d269827ce0906c370920d3; b1f74feefadcfda8d03f6d23681def91056f2af1; 57cca95fdbd35ba1b283c9c6ec5ae7a81be7adfd; 49f4143eb35926b031df823eeed0458ed40e2f40; da7aa28043f1eda548499a39d241390df4d02a68; daab979a418f96409774b3a7241cff2cac4d1be2,arXiv: Methodology,,
8e6bf589d89139a90394acd0b475d4e14fbe9115,Obesity modifies the stoichiometry of mitochondrial proteins in a way that is distinct to the subcellular localization of the mitochondria in skeletal muscle.,"BACKGROUND
Skeletal muscle mitochondrial content and function appear to be altered in obesity. Mitochondria in muscle are found in well-defined regions within cells, and they are arranged in a way that form distinct subpopulations of subsarcolemmal (SS) and intermyofibrillar (IMF) mitochondria. We sought to investigate differences in the proteomes of SS and IMF mitochondria between lean subjects and subjects with obesity.


METHODS
We performed comparative proteomic analyses on SS and IMF mitochondria isolated from muscle samples obtained from lean subjects and subjects with obesity. Mitochondria were isolated using differential centrifugation, and proteins were subjected to label-free quantitative tandem mass spectrometry analyses. Collected data were evaluated for abundance of mitochondrial proteins using spectral counting. The Reactome pathway database was used to determine metabolic pathways that are altered in obesity.


RESULTS
Among proteins, 73 and 41 proteins showed different (mostly lower) expression in subjects with obesity in the SS and IMF mitochondria, respectively (false discovery rate-adjusted Pâ€¯â‰¤â€¯0.05). We specifically found an increase in proteins forming the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain (ETC) complex II, but a decrease in proteins forming protein complexes I and III of the ETC and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase in subjects with obesity in the IMF, but not SS, mitochondria. Obesity was associated with differential effects on metabolic pathways linked to protein translation in the SS mitochondria and ATP formation in the IMF mitochondria.


CONCLUSIONS
Obesity alters the expression of mitochondrial proteins regulating key metabolic processes in skeletal muscle, and these effects are distinct to mitochondrial subpopulations located in different regions of the muscle fibers.

83ffc964b977aa753f546d39d74dcecd3e374c3b,Validating Regulatory Predictions from Diverse Bacteria with Mutant Fitness Data,"Although transcriptional regulation is fundamental to understanding bacterial physiology, the targets of most bacterial transcription factors are not known. Comparative genomics has been used to identify likely targets of some of these transcription factors, but these predictions typically lack experimental support. Here, we used mutant fitness data, which measures the importance of each gene for a bacteriumâ€™s growth across many conditions, to validate regulatory predictions from RegPrecise, a curated collection of comparative genomics predictions. Because characterized transcription factors often have correlated fitness with one of their targets (either positively or negatively), correlated fitness patterns provide support for the comparative genomics predictions. At a false discovery rate of 3%, we identified significant cofitness for at least one target of 158 TFs in 107 ortholog groups and from 24 bacteria. Thus, high-throughput genetics can be used to identify a high-confidence subset of the sequence-based regulatory predictions.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Shiori Sagawa"", ids = ""49727118""); list(name = ""Morgan N.

The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of WPH on gene expression. Male Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to a 2 h swimming exercise were administered either a carbohydrate-amino acid diet or a carbohydrate-WPH diet immediately after exercise. At 1 h after exercise, epitrochlearis muscle mRNA was sampled and subjected to DNA microarray analysis. We found that ingestion of WPH altered 189 genes after considering the false discovery rate. Among the up-regulated genes, eight Gene Ontology (GO) terms were enriched, which included key elements such as Cd24, Ccl2, Ccl7 and Cxcl1 involved in muscle repair after exercise. In contrast, nine GO terms were enriched in gene sets that were down-regulated by the ingestion of WPH, and these GO terms fell into two clusters, 'regulation of ATPase activity' and 'immune response'. Furthermore, we found that WPH activated two upstream proteins, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± (HIF-1Î±), which might act as key factors for regulating gene expression. These results suggest that ingestion of WPH, compared with ingestion of a mixture of amino acids with an identical amino acid composition, induces greater changes in the post-exercise gene expression profile via activation of the proteins ERK1/2 and HIF-1Î±.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Atsushi Kanda"", ids = ""143931407""); list(name = ""Tomoko Ishijima"", ids = ""35032523""); list(name = ""Fumika Shinozaki"", ids = ""46311522""); list(name = ""Kyosuke Nakayama"", ids = ""11038903""); list(name = ""Tomoyuki Fukasawa"", ids = ""2034272""); list(name = ""Yuji Nakai"", ids = ""2359288""); list(name = ""Keiko Abe"", ids = ""1699047""); list(name = ""Keiko Kawahata"", ids = ""3972710""); list(name = ""Shuji Ikegami"", ids = ""3800134"")",4003581ec47cb8eb577bb4ca9ceacc501b348a6a; 2b8dcb2478dee9c9c89213de0aaef2ba24a9cffd; 8fd0a52753487dc6d09fb1c0fb79fe29a31a2531,00f20bae8687cc5a3e119e3b2c7fbce39e2c9f80; faa53ea6381d5ba0a51ed2c638eac04ab35ef931; a4a21145b1e973e6b6d3ec509cb7703671ef3c72; 96d67e993e58ae60d60448a689a4513243e14689; 6db8bd9237afb8d4abe3f18585da1a7d29d758c1; 70e7559d540188ff2587cc62f186bad8997ad9fe; bddc280f59a0976862c18ce42784bd58c775f0f4; 385f693aa59fae9349535e1d23b4dc7b34138043; c1372ad5a9676f076b3b52d62e27592e3a5c5dfc; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; 2ee4c5ccf334c679e4fa3e1162ceeea6e1d5e51b; ababec6a2348415125e5767fb3b75abc718fd1a3; fe12e12b6ca77c2f4083b53764ab28de1c62901c; 8e1ab21af5abed5435bfaa6aeaa3a52e9ac57bd1; 4211224f415ad82fd114798f017348f00060d159; 33a015957fa8be97d64db7b8b7baf810fced5339; f37f905a5159082ce749a8e31ce55a204bd1c8f5; 6c431e529d9ef8998498a64ccb87e167bd0d39d6; 43d5fc33ac261c410701bb1faa4b8349912a1a0f; 146e2a95d4a8d98b2feea0df0e853212e7b948c5; 12111e61dfd463202c472b02c5429b525f8427fd; 105d244f5c78165d85a1348a5863d0cc2b32fd87; 0498ecdf8a2723f7d36459149616336be378b0cd; 6dcb6a19f9ef2b9cf0e2f036ecb6376b13a6d118; 0fd548a07b8d113f5f6a6255abe191668120ac53; 7edb80c6605d84e4b29a5578bd725ec54212222a; f610acd15f1594f629a8e2ad892a4ff244ef0524; d1978036b3cc9c88aae8a07837abde76d10f3c30; c448c37502e25f5e3550e8254ef990137b75e1bb; a1214b2c1100ae92b15845952a3431a77ad3c94b; 358a7564010e221a633f94d57c672025c91b29e6; ed520a69fad82b8e0f6a42ff85643418c82d0c4a; 0669a1962ec196d659b9dfcd581dc22deca77c9b; 52e2dc6d05a2d83705b369734c1e9fd70b21dbba; a006e7ed46de4e91cac819fcc4e209d906bed8af; abb22d88b427b4a04a8c16df776254efa34b359c; 6feca780f98dd6a5d0fe34385b2c3eeddffb2cf8; a11d805dd96004fe85336d45d73a2b1a7c4624d4; 086091ae3068b6813723ee7be215c6de192396dd; 1794d208471a07bfb68d3d422cd9f61500e70a86; 8d2111cd7eb0b211eaba3f39a269810f0925c993; 72712c445768a85cde42b884d0ef040eb4a71ac5; cb34811f6f4e8668f3e3cef55b75b84b5c4f1fef; c4588e6b6a5d1cca500632812a0ecd55678d170d; 67510f992d3c9b75bbbbec0207e68eaf3248ae25; 0a339fc9f8d28b82ed4d679b8931427e24940204; a19e5648e5852ef18d024531a3186c716605fd2c; f3261443d2ce313291c838c181a9820bd593b330; 656e2c679550065b3139acc91ab88abb9f37602f; ffa5df051242d69fb78de1716243926654f2057c; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; c988fa47115bd94071dfa0a8f75b94d3d88231a0; fb2a1c4548599b067c0908ae86e75bb0d265bea0; 323b03fc18864614261f2aa15e40c4b0d33e9c85; 81915ba141f0ade933d30e4774450f1f214e97f0; f330a8d168654261b5427230900ffbdba5bf065c; 88af3dbda3519f24bc043264caf1ab956ecda177; 2c6edc561f4205c030142095f97f95c7e4e581cd; 3966ec31064579897b04728140ee70dcd0c962c2; e55b18217d1c73a1eb10728b944b799df690f4d5; 7420577ea0d28e0603d4a3aa8f2f3bc1dfc51182,The British journal of nutrition,111 12,"

36c5e8ee3dcc32ca2356bb8f552fa78f5bf5b41a,Identifying Drug Compounds Targeting Tumor Metabolism in Glioblastomas,"BACKGROUND: Rapidly proliferating tumour cells preferentially use aerobic glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to support growth and survive unfavorable microenvironment conditions. This metabolic reprogramming is referred to as the â€œWarburg effectâ€. We have shown that glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2) is crucial for the Warburg effect in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We also demonstrate that loss of HK2 sensitizes GBM cells in-vitro and in-vivo to chemo and radiation therapy, significantly prolonging survival in intracranial models. We also show that loss of HK2 is most relevant in hypoxia. Given these results and that HK2 is an enzyme with little to no expression in normal brain, it provides an attractive target for targeting in GBMs. However, no direct inhibitor of HK2 that crosses the blood brain barrier exists. We therefore explored whether a system biology approach to identify gene networks regulated by or associated with HK2 that could lead to promising treatment strategies. METHODS: Using HK2 knockdown by siRNA in established GBM cell lines and primary GBM cultures we established gene signatures and networks associated with HK2 expression, identifying 1000 genes with a 2 fold change with p-value <0.01 and false discovery rate of <1%. Using a drug screen of 30 compounds that were predicted to repress HK2 expression and associated metabolic gene signatures we identified the azole class of antifungals as inhibitors of tumour metabolism by reducing proliferation, lactate production, glucose uptake and increasing O2 consumption in GBM cells but not primary normal human astrocytes or normal neural stem cells. RESULTS: We evaluated the in vivo efficacy of these azole compounds in pre-clinical orthotopic xenograft mouse models and transgenic models of GBM. The compounds in combination with standard chemo and radiation therapy significantly restrict tumor growth, alter tumor hypoxia and ROS production. We also show that there is a altered response to DNA damage pathways using these compounds, suggesting novel metabolic mechanisms by which these antifungals sensitize GBMs to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The azole class of antifungals may represent a new way of targeting tumour metabolism in tumours dependent on HK2.

5a210e0b57616480f7c99a52161c1f6060990369,SNPxGE2: a database for human SNP-coexpression associations,"MOTIVATION
Recently, gene-coexpression relationships have been found to be often conditional and dynamic. Many studies have suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have impacts on gene expression variations in human populations.


RESULTS
The SNPxGE(2) database contains the computationally predicted human SNP-coexpression associations, i.e. the differential coexpression between two genes is associated with the genotypes of an SNP. These data were generated from a large-scale association study that was based on the HapMap phase I data, which covered 269 individuals from 4 human populations, 556 873 SNPs and 15 000 gene expression profiles. In order to reduce the computational cost, the SNP-coexpression associations were assessed using gap/substitution models, proven to have a comparable power to logistic regression models. The results, at a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.1, consisted of 44 769 and 50 792 SNP-coexpression associations based on single and pooled populations, respectively, and can be queried in the SNPxGE(2) database via either gene symbol or reference SNP ID. For each reported association, a detailed information page is provided.

Vitamin D supplementation has been proposed as a strategy to improve muscle function in older adults. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol) on whole genome gene expression in skeletal muscle of vitamin D deficient frail older adults. A double-blind placebo controlled trial was conducted in vitamin D deficient frail older adults (aged above 65), characterized by blood 25-hydroxycholecalciferol concentrations between 20 and 50 nmol/L. Subjects were randomized across the placebo group (n=12) and the calcifediol group (n=10, 10 Âµg per day). Muscle biopsies were obtained before and after six months of calcifediol or placebo supplementation and subjected to whole genome gene expression profiling using Affymetrix HuGene 2.1ST arrays. Expression of the vitamin D receptor gene was virtually undetectable in human skeletal muscle biopsies. Calcifediol supplementation led to a significant increase in blood 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels compared to the placebo group. No difference between treatment groups was observed on strength outcomes. The whole transcriptome effects of calcifediol and placebo were very weak. Correcting for multiple testing using false discovery rate did not yield any differentially expressed genes using any sensible cut-offs. P-values were uniformly distributed across all genes, suggesting that low p-values are likely to be false positives. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis and principle component analysis was unable to separate treatment groups. Calcifediol supplementation did not affect the skeletal muscle transcriptome in frail older adults. Our findings indicate that vitamin D supplementation has no effects on skeletal muscle gene expression, suggesting that skeletal muscle may not be a direct target of vitamin D in older adults.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Roland W.

The identification of these micro and macro environmental factors created a real need for new analysis tools and translational models. The ""big data"" created and harvested in health care, from the molecular to the physiological, imaging and environmental data, etc, created an inevitable growing need for sophisticated analysis tools. ""In 10 years each individual will be surrounded by a virtual cloud of billions of data pointsâ€”P4 medicine"" 1. More than that there is a need to provide a broad understanding on the all factors interplay, based on combining all relevant data sources and utilizing all available analysis tools. New technologies are developed to harvest, verify, control, transfer, align and transform data, as well as new innovative analysis and predictive targeted tools to meet these challenges, both in academia and industry. In parallel there is a growing need to new innovative and sophisticated tools to analyse ""small data"". That is to enable reliable and responsible preventive, predictive and personalized medicine, in most cases where there is more data than equivalent records. New philosophical approaches, as well as innovative analysis tools, specially developed to meet these challenges, must be taken, based on the coupling of computer sciences, complexity theory, non linear dynamics, logic theory, etc. That is in compliance and in parallel to the statistical models such as generalized linear models or classification trees that are further endowed by new regularization methods, as well as recent developments in FDR (False Discovery Rate) testing emphasizing the hierarchical structure. 
 
A targeted data mining tools will be presented to comply with the real need to deal with all interplay of all factors originated in different sources, such as: molecular, genetics, images, physiology, etc, presented in different scales. More than that the goal is to analyze small sets of data containing many parameters, including missing values. The presented patented rule discovery and prediction data mining tool, enables the simultaneous analysis of multilevel, multisource data (imaging, signals, categorical, numerical and descriptive data) as is, with no data manipulation, such as normalization, or neglecting part of the data. The goal is to relate to the whole data set as is, while handling missing data - which is one of the major needs in providing the â€œwhole systemâ€ approach. The algorithm reveals the underlying rules while attaching a level of confidence to each rule, identifies the unexpected rules and detects the unexpected cases. Furthermore the tool was found to be less sensitive to over- fitting (small sets with many parameters). 
 
In summary the Data Mining and prediction tool is proven to reveal all If Than rules, all If than Not rules and a subset of If and Only If (necessary and sufficient conditions) tools, with no prior assumptions. Three detailed examples will be presented. The evaluation of the Epoetin adverse effects to assess long term risks and advancing towards better Epoetin driven treatment modalities, based on the survival analysis of dialysis patients and cardiovascular patients treated with EPO. The second example will deal with dementia and neurodegenerative combined data taken from the hospital practice (MCI, AD and normal patients) to evaluate and optimize the various treatments and provide accurate predictions. The third example deals with the analysis of the progression of disease in ALS patients based on the patientâ€™s current disease status. The data mining tool was already successfully applied to other applications such as: autoimmune diseases, drug development, personalized skin treatment, skin genetic data and biomarkers analysis, etc.",2014,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Mira Marcus-Kalish"", ids = ""1402873856"")",d79a4c746ce73d81e891808cb4d2c20bbe4bd4dd; 3a0829212467df7be70985614da25e83d45b491b,21fe04d3b6db7b44472706aa79b577e2e1cb30eb; d79a4c746ce73d81e891808cb4d2c20bbe4bd4dd,The EPMA Journal,5,A52 - A52

In the current analysis of brain networks, there is no unique way to derive the adjacency matrix, which is a useful representation for a graph. Its entries, containing information about the existence of links, are identified by thresholding the correlation between the time series that characterized the dynamic behavior of the nodes. In this work, we put forward a strategy to choose a suitable threshold on the correlation matrix considering the problem of multiple comparisons in order to control the error rates. In this context we propose to control the positive false discovery rate (pFDR) and a similar measure involving false negatives, called the positive false nondiscovery rate (pFNR). In particular, we provide point and interval estimators for pFNR and a method for balancing the two types of error, demonstrating it by using functional magnetic resonance imaging data and Monte Carlo simulations.",2014,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sara Sala"", ids = ""37183106""); list(name = ""Piero Quatto"", ids = ""3252353""); list(name = ""Paola Valsasina"", ids = ""2649341""); list(name = ""Federica Agosta"", ids = ""2497261""); list(name = ""Massimo Filippi"", ids = ""49881926"")",2c617229233d15d0b6f4ab4bca1afa652cea4a66; 0cd7469b7fc4ad90a0552e7124f60f1d216f467f; 81443684485a0c786081b2c219a1254b9ed3eb16; 23dc9602e11eac6d832b19c08c92b2584c692b26,,Statistics in medicine,33 1,"

ceed5d92c3ddceba7357266104f8c472045ce77b,193 Differential Gene Expression in Cumulus Cells of Developmentally Competent v. Challenged Bovine Oocytes,"It is well established that exposure of cumulusâ€“oocyte complexes (COC) to heat stress during the first 12 h of maturation reduces blastocyst development by 42 to 65%. Previous research supports the notion that some of the effects of heat stress on oocyte competence may be cumulus-mediated. To determine the extent to which this may occur, COC were matured at 38.5Â°C for 24 h (control) or 41Â°C for the first 12 h of maturation followed by 38.5Â°C for remaining 12 h (heat stress). A subset of COC underwent IVF with Percoll-prepared sperm and then was cultured in KSOM containing 0.5% BSA to assess developmental competence. Remaining oocytes were denuded. Cumulus cells, kept separate by treatment, were stored in lysis buffer at â€“80Â°C until RNA extraction. Total RNA from cumulus was amplified prior to hybridization to bovine Affymetrix GeneChips (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA; n = 8 pools per treatment collected on 8 different occasions; n = 16 chips). Following pre-processing using the MAS5.0 algorithm, microarray data were subjected to linear modeling and empirical Bayes analyses (Bioconductor, Limma package). False discovery rate was controlled using the Benjamini and Hochberg method, and differentially expressed genes were selected by an adjusted P-value (P < 0.05). Functional annotation of selected genes was performed using NetAffx (Affymetrix Inc.) and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID; NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Heat stress of COC reduced blastocyst development (27.2 v. 16.1% for control v. heat stress, respectively; SEM = 1.6; P < 0.002). Approximately 66 and 65% of 24 000 possible genes were called present (i.e. expressed) in RNA from cumulus of competent (control) v. challenged (heat-stressed) oocytes, respectively. In cumulus from developmentally challenged COC, increased abundance of 42 genes (36 currently annotated) was noted. Use of DAVID demonstrated enrichment of genes important for electron transport and energy generation (NOS2A, MAOB, CYP11A1, HSD11B1L, LTB4DH). Further examination of gene ontology identified genes associated with mitochondrial function (SLC25A10, MAOB, CYP11A1), cell signaling (similar to JAK-3, FSHR, CYP11A1, WNT2B), cytoskeleton (ACTA1), antioxidant activity (GSTA1), and extracellular region (FMOD). In contrast, cumulus from developmentally competent COC had increased expression of 22 genes (20 currently annotated), of which 15% were related to protein binding (CAV1, MMP9, TGFB2) according to DAVID. Further analysis using gene ontology revealed genes associated with extracellular matrix formation (MMP9, MMP19, PCOLCE2) and neural tissue (METRNL). In summary, alterations in cumulus gene expression were associated with differences in developmental competence of oocytes. Additional research is necessary to examine the extent to which identified genes account for functional differences in oocyte competence.

KCNJ1 encodes a potassium channel and one study observed that a KCNJ1 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was associated with changes in fasting glucose (FG) during hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) treatment. We used linear regression to test association of KCNJ1 SNPs and haplotypes with FG changes during HCTZ treatment in the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses (PEAR) study. We used logistic regression to test association of KCNJ1 variation with NOD in HCTZ-treated patients from the International Verapamil SR Trandolapril Study (INVEST). Multivariate regression analyses were performed by race/ethnicity with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. In PEAR blacks, a KCNJ1 SNP was associated with increased FG during HCTZ treatment (beta=8.47, PFDR=0.009). KCNJ1 SNPs and haplotypes were associated with NOD risk in all INVEST race/ethnic groups (strongest association: odds ratio 2.14 (1.31â€“3.53), PFDR=0.03).

37f71a6aa468455e1cafd7c9591f4eba2cc10a0a,Mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling reveals different metabolite patterns in invasive ovarian carcinomas and ovarian borderline tumors.,"Metabolites are the end products of cellular regulatory processes, and their levels can be regarded as the ultimate response of biological systems to genetic or environmental changes. We have used a metabolite profiling approach to test the hypothesis that quantitative signatures of primary metabolites can be used to characterize molecular changes in ovarian tumor tissues. Sixty-six invasive ovarian carcinomas and nine borderline tumors of the ovary were analyzed by gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) using a novel contamination-free injector system. After automated mass spectral deconvolution, 291 metabolites were detected, of which 114 (39.1%) were annotated as known compounds. By t test statistics with P < 0.01, 51 metabolites were significantly different between borderline tumors and carcinomas, with a false discovery rate of 7.8%, estimated with repeated permutation analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed four principal components that were significantly different between both groups, with the highest significance found for the second component (P = 0.00000009). PCA as well as additional supervised predictive models allowed a separation of 88% of the borderline tumors from the carcinomas. Our study shows for the first time that large-scale metabolic profiling using GC-TOF MS is suitable for analysis of fresh frozen human tumor samples, and that there is a consistent and significant change in primary metabolism of ovarian tumors, which can be detected using multivariate statistical approaches. We conclude that metabolomics is a promising high-throughput, automated approach in addition to functional genomics and proteomics for analyses of molecular changes in malignant tumors.",2006,Medicine;

0d0ab5d5d7fe502a94e85a224966fc153d05d617,Prevalence of autoimmune diseases in in-patients with schizophrenia: nationwide population-based study.,"BACKGROUND
The association between autoimmune diseases and schizophrenia has rarely been systematically investigated.


AIMS
To investigate the association between schizophrenia and a variety of autoimmune diseases and to explore possible gender variation in any such association.


METHOD
Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database was used to identify 10 811 hospital in-patients with schizophrenia and 108 110 age-matched controls. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed, separately, to evaluate the association between autoimmune diseases and schizophrenia. We applied the false discovery rate to correct for multiple testing.


RESULTS
When compared with the control group, the in-patients with schizophrenia had an increased risk of Graves' disease (odds ratio (OR) = 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.67), psoriasis (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.07-2.04), pernicious anaemia (OR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.04-2.80), celiac disease (OR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.12-5.27) and hypersensitivity vasculitis (OR = 5.00, 95% CI 1.64-15.26), whereas a reverse association with rheumatoid arthritis (OR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.35-0.76) was also observed. Gender-specific variation was found for SjÃ¶gren syndrome, hereditary haemolytic anaemia, myasthenia gravis, polymyalgia rheumatica and dermatomyositis.


CONCLUSIONS
Schizophrenia was associated with a greater variety of autoimmune diseases than was anticipated. Further investigation is needed to gain a better understanding of the aetiology of schizophrenia and autoimmune diseases.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shaw-Ji Chen"", ids = ""78582997""); list(name = ""Yu-Lin Chao"", ids = ""49036996"");

e7478fcef58b512ff59537dc9d0a67c8d2e2df39,Is NF2 a Key Player of the Differentially Expressed Gene Between Spinal Cord Ependymoma and Intracranial Ependymoma?,"BACKGROUND
Although intracranial and spinal ependymomas are histopathologically similar, the molecular landscape is heterogeneous. An urgent need exists to identify differences in the genomic profiles to tailor treatment strategies. In the present study, we delineated differential gene expression patterns between intracranial and spinal ependymomas.


METHODS
We searched the Gene Expression Omnibus database using the term ""ependymoma"" and analyzed the raw gene expression profiles of 292 ependymomas (31 spinal and 261 intracranial). The gene expression data were analyzed to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 2 regions. The fold change (FC) and false discovery rate (FDR) were used to assess DEGs after gene integration (|log2FC|>2; FDR P < 0.01). Enrichment and pathway analysis was also performed.


RESULTS
A total of 201 genes (105 upregulated and 96 downregulated) were significant DEGs in the data sets. The underexpression of NF2 in spinal ependymomas was statistically significant (FDR PÂ = 7.91Â Ã— 10-9). However, the FC of NF2 did not exceed the cutoff value (log2FC,Â -1.2). The top 5 ranked upregulated genes were ARX, HOXC6, HOXA9, HOXA5, and HOXA3, which indicated that spinal ependymomas frequently demonstrate overexpression of HOX family genes, which play fundamental roles in specifying anterior/posterior body patterning. Moreover, the gene ontology enrichment analysis specified ""anterior/posterior pattern specification"" and ""neuron migration"" in spinal and intracranial ependymomas, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
The most substantial magnitude of DEGs in ependymoma might be HOX genes. However, whether the differential expression of these genes is the cause or consequence of the disease remains to be elucidated in a larger prospective study.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ki Tae Kim"", ids = ""2749596""); list(name = ""Chang-Hyun Lee"", ids = ""144206648""); list(name = ""Chun Kee Chung"", ids = ""144750921""); list(name = ""Ju Han Kim"", ids = ""14834398"")",,6fbf3bf51b6f2729f707edbbef5b07d0afb2f00d; 4aebb4ac524eda23b1e9576ebd7b793c6476a34b; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; 1e54adc32b396ec4d5744605b96f846b37b274b8; e82bf3a9a16d60abaf36c560524b608ae7ef622f; 54ec7d67dc13ca59129c2a30c7fd5b7f7bbf7a12; 6c62fed2a0b8d7a54ea80c11a421c4e4cd863867; c15128f9d1052e922eba9feef433ad5efd316210; 529d6704a623192c7010f63eca0d25814fa5dc60; 788b782ea2a378585a682c4b08cfe9a94d4b7f3e; d2860a370a0386c57fecc4eef2e43779352fa410; 30537a050eba8128c330ba800ee0dcb62717dac6; c0c9602cf22798a86a6b1e3473e09fd546a9966c; 7c56ce675fe470b4ee2ea8c47b41cde3a0164cbb; d83e8fad2d48b44cfc6e2a77aefd4802ff3addb0; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; f13c7fa5dc19a8a1eaa9f355d4b80acd98a4fb19; 1e0b3da7eaa41ae1edf5a5ba501343e71573ef23; 04f82fc493f46b4cfb22c67c3247a573e42990b7; 390dae19596693cdaef0e2a8c416e544a8b53fe7; b8608bff54e1cc933eead9e40c725d7933a567ff; f01a5ce9fde7e2262fcfc335381a172536f40c0e; 7e1d6f0f1739acb0458d7f9cc8c9f0406e722ce7; a771fcac9b594648962477eaeff41614344605ad; 52125dd0e436a5fe3ced11587aa4f37a01c51a87; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 2a5e760963337d496c21318407a95b721e141eda; aa1f3834f4142c1dd36e5a7f581966920958d293; b662ebb46911652045d886620da58a8294f96e02; 2b6b47d9cd06983f3ed1784dc02e803db7f8f202; 37f47ce11ad87b569cab4acf6316df5dac7b433a; 28fbc2128b3c15188d12ce1b7b103f8036010c44; 3988081f83332dd3f78c1928d4e376eaf730944d; 59f95bea11adc4d767b9f30d8926d5fb1855b6ab; d9bfde03bf2948a3ab4b56a13a722ee782683517; 24b8008a3eab540c27e59fe3f4d8dd2b6d7dccc5; 251e40a3502ff24f7b1ccdba4d8e50f7b3472727; c9a74adcbd6ed7978c01c0023670f143053a20ef; 7803951428300350afc5d400d33ae7ea83f558fc; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532,World neurosurgery,118,"

06973eef1129898c6fa5028e0ac15d97f7cf2163,"Are body circumferences able to predict strength, muscle mass and bone characteristics in obesity? A preliminary study in women","Measurement of body circumferences (BCs) is widely used as an anthropometric tool to assess body composition and health risk in obese individuals. In this preliminary work we evaluated the association of several BCs with Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)-measured lean mass as well as leg press test scores with an aim at exploring the potential of BCs as predictor of body composition and muscle strength. A total of 34 female participants aged 47.3Â±7.6 y who were obese (BMI, 30.4-43.7 kg/m2) were recruited. The upper arm (relaxed), wrist, chest, waist, hip, thigh, and calf circumferences were measured. The skinfold-corrected muscle (including bone) circumferences at the arm, thigh, and calf site were also calculated. Lean mass components were measured by DXA with a Hologic QDR Explorer scanner according to the manufacturer's procedures. Lower limbs strength was assessed with the 1-Repetition Maximum leg press. Bivariate association between variables was assessed with the Spearman's correlation coefficient after the Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate procedure. Predictive equations were developed using stepwise multiple regression analysis. Several statistically significant correlations (Benjamini and Hochberg corrected P [Pc] < 0.05) were present between BCs and DXA-measured body composition variables, and leg press test scores with special regard to the chest, arm, waist, and hip circumferences.

3b15f171c936a1e48d5956571b4f3e74d84916ef,Association of JARID2 polymorphisms with non-syndromic orofacial clefts in northern Chinese Han population.,"OBJECTIVES
Non-syndromic orofacial clefts (NSOC) are the most common human craniofacial malformation in all worldwide populations. Recently, the jumoji AT-rich interaction domain 2 (JARID2) had been reported to be a novel candidate gene for non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P). The SNPs rs2076056, rs2237138 and rs2299043 in JARID2 were highly significant in Italian families.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
In the current research, a case-control study was conducted to examine the association between these three SNPs and NSOC in a northern Chinese Han population. Genotyping of the three SNPs were performed using SNaPshot minisequencing technique.


RESULTS
Distribution of rs2237138 genotypes in CL/P group was different from those in the control group (P = 0.04), but significant results did not persist after Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple tests. Further logistic regression analysis showed that rs2237138 GG genotypes were associated with decreased CL/P susceptibility (OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.13-0.84), compared with the AA wild-type homozygote. For the haplotype CGT, a statistically difference was identified between the CL/P group and controls (P = 0.04). And carriers of GAT haplotype were considered to be less frequent among cleft palate only group as compared to controls (P = 0.02). However, both of the haplotypes association did not remain statistically significant after Benjamini and Hochberg FDR correction.


CONCLUSION
We got a weak association between these polymorphisms and NSOC in both single-marker and haplotype analyses. Our data further strengthen the conclusion that JARID2 polymorphisms are associated with NSOC susceptibility.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yanru Hao"", ids = ""5743442""); list(name = ""Na Mi"", ids = ""47584166""); list(name = ""Xiaohui Jiao"", ids = ""46613785""); list(name = ""Xudong Zheng"", ids = ""50432685""); list(name = ""Tao Song"", ids = ""40430417""); list(name = ""Deshu Zhuang"", ids = ""4427912""); list(name = ""Subao Tian"", ids = ""7967618""); list(name = ""Dongfei Feng"", ids = ""49732342"")",43fa7d897d771ef89e57cd127d6e568d3c5e77c4; 9cc19a2987176561d369972052ab700b8e70a8d8; 7c67dbd18c1d41ed294517aaaad4250fc872a77b,,Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,44 5,"

6ceaebbb0e557435c2db77a98c32fa4bd7a66a1e,Predictors of Hematologic Toxicity and Chemotherapy Dose Intensity in Patients Undergoing Chemoradiation for Pancreatic Cancer,"Objectives: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has been shown to decrease abdominal toxicity in patients undergoing chemoradiation (CRT) for pancreatic cancer. We evaluated whether IMRT impacts the rates of hematologic toxicity and chemotherapy dose intensity in patients undergoing CRT. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients with borderline resectable or locally advanced pancreatic cancer undergoing CRT between 2006 and 2012. Exclusion criteria included receipt of non-gemcitabine therapy, chemotherapy before CRT, or abnormal baseline hematologic indices. Endpoints included total gemcitabine dose received, dose intensity, unplanned dose reductions, and hematologic toxicity (WBC, ANC, platelet, and hemoglobin). Patient/treatment factors were evaluated for their relationship to the above endpoints during CRT and within the first 3 months post-CRT. Statistical analysis was performed using the Fisher exact test and regression models. Because of the multiple comparisons in the presented analysis, a false discovery rate adjustment was performed at the 5% false discovery rate level. Results: Eighty-five patients met the inclusion criteria. Fifty-eight (68.2%) patients received treatment with IMRT, and 27 (31.8%) patients were treated with 3D-conformal radiation. During CRT, there was no relationship between radiation technique and gemcitabine dose received, dose intensity, or hematologic grade 3+ toxicity. Post-CRT, there was no relationship between radiation technique and total gemcitabine dose received, dose intensity, or dose reduction. Patients receiving IMRT were more likely to have ANC grade 3+ toxicity (P=0.007) post-CRT, although this was no longer statistically significant after correction. There were no other relationships between treatment technique and hematologic toxicity. Conclusions: IMRT technique may be associated with higher hematologic toxicity in patients undergoing CRT for pancreatic cancer. Given the expanding use of CRT, additional study is needed to identify the impact of IMRT on myelosuppression in these patients.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Talha Shaikh"", ids = ""2754467""); list(name = ""Lora S.

b3af65d5a6b3f596775b56fcacfd4e26fb61259b,Resistance to Anthracyclines and Taxanes in Breast Cancer,"Taxanes and anthracyclines are widely used in chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of invasive breast cancer. Whether used in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings, numerous clinical trials have validated their effectiveness in improving both progression-free and overall survival in breast cancer patients. However, while clinical response (decrease in tumor size by palpation) is common, for many patients this response is short-lived, after which tumors become refractory to treatment. In addition, some tumors exhibit innate (intrinsic) resistance to these regimens at the start of treatment. Consequently, the vast majority of patients do not exhibit either a pathologic complete response post-treatment or a survival benefit from chemotherapy. Numerous in vitro studies have identified potential mechanisms of action for the anthracyclines and taxanes and how tumors may evade the cytotoxic properties of these agents, but their clinical relevance remains questionable. In vivo studies of drug resistance are less subject to such criticisms, but false discovery rates can be high, in particular for genomic studies of biomarkers of drug response or resistance. Nevertheless, studies of drug response and resistance are now starting to provide useful tools to distinguish between responding and non-responding tumors and insight on how to best treat patients with tumors that are refractory to treatment.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Derek W.

a0eae6edcd4a75327eed792942e559dd8b0ce4fe,Using Optimal F-Measure and Random Resampling in Gene Ontology Enrichment Calculations,"Background: A central question in bioinformatics is how to minimize arbitrariness and bias in analysis of patterns of enrich-ment in data. A prime example of such a question is enrichment of gene ontology (GO) classes in lists of genes. Our paper deals with two issues within this larger question. One is how to calculate the false discovery rate (FDR) within a set of ap-parently enriched ontologies, and the second how to set that FDR within the context of assessing significance for addressing biological questions, to answer these questions we compare a random resampling method with a commonly used method for assessing FDR, the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method. We further develop a heuristic method for evaluating Type II (false negative) errors to enable utilization of F-Measure binary classification theory for distinguishing â€œsignificantâ€ from â€œnon-significantâ€ degrees of enrichment. Results: The results show the preferability and feasibility of random resampling assessment of FDR over the analytical methods with which we compare it. They also show that the reasonableness of any arbitrary threshold depends strongly on the structure of the dataset being tested, suggesting that the less arbitrary method of F-measure optimization to determine significance threshold is preferable. Conclusion: Therefore, we suggest using F-measure optimization instead of placing an arbitrary threshold to evaluate the significance of Gene Ontology Enrichment results, and using resampling to replace analytical methods",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Weihao Ge"", ids = ""15539316""); list(name = ""Zeeshan Fazal"", ids = ""2133303""); list(name = ""Eric Jakobsson"", ids = ""35126330"")",5f359a09e4a165ab7c2cae48226dc6ff1ce4bef6; c1da50de6e14152e58ab0d9aade149d18de955b5; a0eae6edcd4a75327eed792942e559dd8b0ce4fe,b3e1705716a12a2cea281dbd4bab6aa13b6d8b87; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 20e50283ec533173b20c83e08633136ba940b724; 155b044c0592dfa9f154410aa2d14b742a454772; 314394396fe89512af1347294945672c410e6b04; b5959ed4a1c5ad9e07fb086e4114f4574ebadc2a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; aba9fe2adac4d90653e18bc56eb8da227b325ab0; 6d03a38c5ddb7c7cd1ceb59b28907dc918c5d83a; 47e0eca9f722167c3ec1e9f0ad5d48c81e83d1f8; f0aec5b5e894344f1c8dba1365ed2532f1ce8375; 81a65f23474ffceb2481836328608102950da979; fe8dca92115553710761ea1ec1464ed8019cf1f9; 5598922da04bdb14c8ff7c52738ca47194493532; 13385cdae7c02326dea524bf58f4b00a4814562e; af2b7af47ff23290f75a48ba2fd1ad1a9aca1dde; 189e44489209454d363e6a0e272f3c5c80bbde1b; 780fffef401b7770064ff9324b4abb03c4ec2ff4; c12582b77b1a275a8841c8a9c85bd17f1e829fb4; 37035131b0e1c693488179047fcc7ecf37fc4a95; 33150d7d001f163a4c69c472a621fc5baa977789; 155345976aa505a10a45e9119f2853df4d7999d7; b35489ba2252a7c55acb7624e2fb9ee62157ea1d; b79ff82502b35738c16b42a47b7f23334fab99c8; 3ce045b9dca7200c7ca85549b2a7520a71c47710; ceba5c7dd58ed45fec31dd69f96816daf8859cb4; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 34339b453bf10ca35965b18d18229e01bc772105; 7a27877026d41260203e80cb2ba9a2389cc98bb0; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; a0eae6edcd4a75327eed792942e559dd8b0ce4fe; 189acf33fe5d51f27b366122e29b603c6f8c6a72; fc30910a8bf8daa3256284580b1dfe98b32d3559; f0d644b716661225de1c0f499eb27c4d2241b9ce; 2b588b189dfc022f5bb4f3c4ac7cd28220a84a2c; 5ef8284be6094d4b60571fcddbce76d3b7292623; a2792d78d7bd427008232a007741d3347fdc2072; e719098eb1f135302c2c1c56f8ee09c8d87e5e87,Frontiers in Applied Mathematics and Statistics,5,20

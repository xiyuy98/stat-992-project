8922092f61e0e23fc3d704260a86ea724cb9398a,Phenotypic characterization and genome-wide association studies of digital cushion thickness in Holstein cows.,"The bovine digital cushion is a compression pad between the distal phalanx and sole and has been associated with claw horn disruption lesions. Digital cushion thickness (DCT) is estimated to be moderately heritable. Therefore, the objectives of our study were to examine influences of management and environment on DCT and to identify genetic markers and candidate genes associated with DCT. In a cohort of 502 Holsteins from 5 farms in New York, DCT and body condition score (BCS) were collected twice, at <137 d prepartum and from 86 to 127 d in milk, corresponding to periods when the digital cushion is thickest and thinnest, respectively, as determined by previous research. Cows underwent sonographic examination of the digital cushion evaluated at the typical sole ulcer site for the right front and hind foot. Linear mixed models were conducted on DCT with the fixed effects of time point, digit, wither height, sacral height, BCS group, and multiple farm system variables separately and included random effects to control for the random subset of cows per farm, repeated measures, and multiple measurements from each cow. The phenotypic results indicated that DCT varied by sample time point, sacral height, parity, digit, BCS group, and wither height. For the genotypic study, 447 DNA samples were genotyped on the Illumina BovineHD 777K beadchip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Quality assessment of markers and samples provided a final data set of 431 samples and 579,449 markers. Genome-wide association studies were conducted for DCT testing inheritance models and genetic variation of digit, foot, time point, and average thickness. One marker passed the Bonferroni correction threshold and 26 passed false discovery rate from 4 genome-wide association studies with covariates of sequencing batch plate, parity group, BCS, wither height, and sacral height. Ten candidate genes were identified, with 2 genes on Bos taurus autosomes 24 and 29 involved in biological functions related to the digital cushion: MC4R and DLG2 were related to fat deposition and bone growth, respectively. The genetic markers discovered in this study have the opportunity to be used in breeding programs using genomic selection to select against claw horn disruption lesions and lameness due to associations between the markers and DCT. Further studies on the biologically plausible candidate genes may identify causative genetic variants and how they relate to DCT through gene regulation, expression, structure, or copy number variation.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Cassandra R.

In order to understand more fully the consequences of MeHg exposure at the molecular level, we profiled gene and miRNA transcripts from the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Animals were exposed to MeHg (10 Î¼M) from embryo to larval 4 (L4) stage and RNAs were isolated. RNA-seq analysis on the Illumina platform revealed 541 genes up- and 261 genes down-regulated at a cutoff of 2-fold change and false discovery rate-corrected significance q < 0.05. Among the up-regulated genes were those previously shown to increase under oxidative stress conditions including hsp-16.11 (2.5-fold), gst-35 (10.1-fold), and fmo-2 (58.5-fold). In addition, we observed up-regulation of 6 out of 7 lipocalin related (lpr) family genes and down regulation of 7 out of 15 activated in blocked unfolded protein response (abu) genes. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis highlighted the effect of genes related to development and organism growth. miRNA-seq analysis revealed 6-8 fold down regulation of mir-37-3p, mir-41-5p, mir-70-3p, and mir-75-3p. Our results demonstrate the effects of MeHg on specific transcripts encoding proteins in oxidative stress responses and in ER stress pathways. Pending confirmation of these transcript changes at protein levels, their association and dissociation characteristics with interaction partners, and integration of these signals, these findings indicate broad and dynamic mechanisms by which MeHg exerts its harmful effects.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Martina RudgalvytÄ—"", ids = ""7322752""); list(name = ""Natalia Vanduyn"", ids = ""4548150""); list(name = ""Vuokko Aarnio"", ids = ""7000628""); list(name = ""Liisa Heikkinen"", ids = ""35908016""); list(name = ""Juhani Peltonen"", ids = ""36809545""); list(name = ""Merja Lakso"", ids = ""4285015""); list(name = ""Richard Nass"", ids = ""39113988""); list(name = ""Garry Wong"", ids = ""143982657"")",4b9d4b6f0852407b58259d771d4a20c52fe8e2b3; 05a0a84af75d7f3b5eb8ffc7bafb8d38656cc696; 613b030031124d27ffe65fa8d56693d511f73a59; 9e5527e79bed951e34ed0e1c3a25e2d13b11ad7b; 8de2fd47dfefde4f1ed84619a1d5d9924bf16ccd; 77ae94b9226e95526570dd85d6f946b8dc729983; 86bc44e1c04e3ebd6bea8bf8f46a1a22bc9c7fa5; 25a4a5b3d5cdec3d72b0a475f5b8c423a3172c0d; 910fa85e5a660ad4d028ba2c617ba6796724bd04; 3b62dda4e87d034586675789dc946632ddb35440; 2fcc2900949b016fb26fe74fb1eb48c922b7322b,473f5268d281ad8fed589ba2b98a5ac9d728ed31; 7de8b5ce383f19493ec3b1407115970229885b61; 0f158c21542a63dfb2dd32da1c37bf28d9f30f24; 491b8d17dff5fb0fe5f6dab97a753e7df812e609; d35cf2102f24a8df8198ef450b3be1d48dc831c5; 14737004704d5ee0fe79217fdbe6e15d5d3ac599; 016896770295b80ba404dc3e8e294040b5c4df3f; a6092833e61a832eaf296307177b3c6eb0c509f7; a6caa64c0ff50d1f11dcdd3f6fea9b88fe411791; 55e960fc52883194e5c9985c4687ad5cdfe72ac9; d69045f57e46b524a082c97318676a59fe5e2209; 16d4ba9cc1d46d452a40ba7faae870a1c4a36cc0; 99f3f96188f4c629f9b8f6a58162a918b3276ddc; ad657df7b9ac80b43e7cc853bbbf7394c5e362c4; 90947c64553041bb83ce5fd97e7782a75ce77d25; 572dae3766375da3a980260e2ada1e892ecd5170; dec51c6be449635310356a01dc59a4eca3fcf75d; d2d8e5fac87faf2b1824b323f1965651c9d3e3f7; 4f294dba9c1cf84e7f34d488700ef88db56ed51d; 22f14a75acede1c05c272d106afbfdff7eabe952; 289f5bda48d59c4dc70f239695dcc8e8c12daa8f; 15cb63f9815e3e941c267621f5b50748cf0239f2; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 8634bb64a012cc28a712e55921c1346610b45216; 4fcf2a5ad163d5cad6b471dac5ddcc4843c7680a; f1753e1be1816ead030502df972eb23ae5d3c0ca; c499a1eb1d35b05b69ba0d5b7045e8fd1e984576; ffb0fb664293777d275651b236858d2485837620; b8b676be3aaa8fb29365f4c1af7ddd24d521140a; 7734da1afb6d2086146c2e4ff6d5320134641777; d30f1289686298f07fc0b8226de261ea548ffbde; e62cd18b5d79b9eef5b074614c84c615822cbf7d; aae4687e9161517e0bd175a86fde68c568eed094; 43422c2803510e1621137850615938b9b0a888b1; fb8bc9b52356aa8480d23bae3e676b67001f714c; 82b7038da689d3437aaa5e4603e1c695e83ec4c4; cafe3cb806bb4b582cba211523b2ad50f68a575e; c36a2c696af2c64fa72e6cd060cb2d66de2fcc81; ebe875cf08dd398e0ed25f518502301c984a9afe; 6f073ce21efec9662461bb1bbd2e580e31ebbc15; 5204c95aa1e87cd4f8e91504b91fc16336c76b88; 5d14caae629964d5b94d44ca6ebe367d23c78f5d; 6e144debb23f848be6f6b70c2997783456360b9f; 10f87d9a29a986520d113e7cc08b40a4a8a021df; 45fc75f0b584ecb1dd0e68065a1af570f69e030e; d515d112ee5bfdd3922c233343b9235a8ded17f6; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 6eaf6391c19a79f3f5c037b629a9fda67bf6814e; b01e9c4ccff1e8f364cc785e3656cd25b3d4a8a3; a87bf34d38277cc55416ad67d586f795a7f03dca; 36b6092bf4dcf06607f13df30e519316b352ee14; 118ac217ae4826e7f1d6cdd711c805fda05f6846; 19c4b59c0a2553f0df6b51d457d1ecec7eadc7bd; 27bbe83b020df65bbd2570bd7aa9f424774a114d; 04dc8f9e3036a9a8e09a82643dc435d7d57cef5a; 25c60a128d28148b29312be5a2e6b70344da6c55; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; 0e2fe165dc627220cc711e1e03b8bea599112884; 9b6369c48dd41e3485b66501dcc8796b95b159c9,Toxicology letters,222 2,"

a70dd3250c8c894ccbfbda96b8d263a20521e541,Association of ambient pollution with inhaler use among patients with COPD: a panel study.,"BACKGROUND
Studies have linked ambient air pollution to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) healthcare encounters. However, the association between air quality and rescue medication use is unknown.


OBJECTIVES
We assessed the role of air pollution exposure for increased short-acting beta-2-agonist (SABA) use in patients with COPD through use of remote monitoring technology.


METHODS
Participants received a portable electronic inhaler sensor to record the date, time and location for SABA use over a 3-month period. Ambient air pollution data and meteorological data were collected from a centrally located federal monitoring station. Mixed-effects Poisson regression was used to examine the association of daily inhaler use with pollutant levels. Four criteria pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O3 and NO2), two particulate matter species (elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon), estimated coarse fraction of PM10 (PM10-2.5) and four multipollutant air quality measures were each examined separately, adjusting for covariates that passed a false discovery rate (FDR) screening.


RESULTS
We enrolled 35 patients with COPD (94.3% male and mean age: 66.5Â±8.5) with a mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) % predicted of 44.9+17.2. Participants had a median of 92 observation days (range 52-109). Participants' average SABA inhaler use ranged from 0.4 to 13.1 puffs/day (median 2.8). Controlling for supplemental oxygen use, long-acting anticholinergic use, modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale and influenza season, an IQR increase in PM10 concentration (8.0â€‰Âµg/m3) was associated with a 6.6% increase in daily puffs (95%â€‰CI 3.5% to 9.9%; FDR <0.001). NO2 and EC concentration were also significantly associated with inhaler use (3.9% and 2.9% per IQR increase, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
Exposure to increased ambient air pollution were associated with a significant increase in SABA use for patients with COPD residing in a low-pollution area.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sheryl Magzamen"", ids = ""145186740""); list(name = ""Assaf P.

28a64cf5b569ede94dc2eaf242f1f23381145575,Kerfdr: a semi-parametric kernel-based approach to local false discovery rate estimation,"BackgroundThe use of current high-throughput genetic, genomic and post-genomic data leads to the simultaneous evaluation of a large number of statistical hypothesis and, at the same time, to the multiple-testing problem. As an alternative to the too conservative Family-Wise Error-Rate (FWER), the False Discovery Rate (FDR) has appeared for the last ten years as more appropriate to handle this problem. However one drawback of FDR is related to a given rejection region for the considered statistics, attributing the same value to those that are close to the boundary and those that are not. As a result, the local FDR has been recently proposed to quantify the specific probability for a given null hypothesis to be true.ResultsIn this context we present a semi-parametric approach based on kernel estimators which is applied to different high-throughput biological data such as patterns in DNA sequences, genes expression and genome-wide association studies.ConclusionThe proposed method has the practical advantages, over existing approaches, to consider complex heterogeneities in the alternative hypothesis, to take into account prior information (from an expert judgment or previous studies) by allowing a semi-supervised mode, and to deal with truncated distributions such as those obtained in Monte-Carlo simulations.

b0587e7ee799958e30265743feb2a84d31c2e733,Reduced dynamic functional connectivity between salience and executive brain networks in insomnia disorder,"Research into insomnia disorder has pointed to large-scale brain network dysfunctions. Dynamic functional connectivity is instrumental to cognitive functions but has not been investigated in insomnia disorder. This study assessed between-network functional connectivity strength and variability in patients with insomnia disorder as compared with matched controls without sleep complaints. Twelve-minute resting-state functional magnetic resonance images and T1-weighed images were acquired in 65 people diagnosed with insomnia disorder (21-69Â years, 48 female) and 65 matched controls without sleep complaints (22-70Â years, 42 female). Pairwise correlations between the activity time series of 14 resting-state networks and temporal variability of the correlations were compared between cases and controls. After false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons, people with insomnia disorder and controls did not differ significantly in terms of mean between-network functional connectivity strength; people with insomnia disorder did, however, show less functional connectivity variability between the anterior salience network and the left executive-control network. The finding suggests less flexible interactions between the networks during the resting state in people with insomnia disorder.",2020,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Yishul Wei"", ids = ""3095886""); list(name = ""Jeanne Leerssen"", ids = ""49303206""); list(name = ""Rick Wassing"", ids = ""6954953""); list(name = ""Diederick Stoffers"", ids = ""39210175""); list(name = ""Joy Perrier"", ids = ""30286741""); list(name = ""Eus J W van Someren"", ids = ""39802083"")",b0587e7ee799958e30265743feb2a84d31c2e733,b0587e7ee799958e30265743feb2a84d31c2e733; a98b84114f055f417fed71f0d2b7c18b220c02a3; 4d722f236b7b4af09823a50b57f37730e30f2b19; ea03176e5680050da2abe6fe2561153abe54cff2; 2088143435734aa91266ba6ab5652f53989aedfc; b0994f7e4cee56f0f9c49e24d9b66e8dd522b297; 6930af71e1cf2e17a44783590446d30f16f06b50; d51dc29f489fb21903b117db5c0f61eb4d33af5d; 435251991ef32a2b6c28c1f4ab58edb6d1add062; c9862b3e89d0676babb0fb1ae43ccfc01681ea8a; dd14404c8bc0fd194fb76e49c141a02a67b179f5; 6bf7946a9a937af23211fbad4f0d69165c8d2d70; 6cd35e38e627ad421075d30ea9559903d095d63f; bedc5317b6033711507aad0dcaa861e6999985bd; 06676fba1c6c1f472c7950e52b5f9c519c973202; 64f291305622b1ca337064166bac84b351502371,Journal of Sleep Research,29,

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a major cause of vision loss in subjects with diabetes. However, studies examining the association between PDR and the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern are lacking. Our aim was to identify epigenetic modifications that associate with and predict PDR in subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D).MethodsDNA methylation was analyzed genome-wide in 485,577 sites in blood from cases with PDR (n = 28), controls (n = 30), and in a prospective cohort (n = 7). False discovery rate analysis was used to correct the data for multiple testing. Study participants with T1D diagnosed before 30 years of age and insulin treatment within 1 year from diagnosis were selected based on 1) subjects classified as having PDR (cases) and 2) subjects with T1D who had had diabetes for at least 10 years when blood DNA was sampled and classified as having no/mild diabetic retinopathy also after an 8.7-year follow-up (controls). DNA methylation was also analyzed in a prospective cohort including seven subjects with T1D who had no/mild diabetic retinopathy when blood samples were taken, but who developed PDR within 6.3 years (converters). The retinopathy level was classified by fundus photography.ResultsWe identified differential DNA methylation of 349 CpG sites representing 233 unique genes including TNF, CHI3L1 (also known as YKL-40), CHN2, GIPR, GLRA1, GPX1, AHRR, and BCOR in cases with PDR compared with controls. The majority of these sites (79 %) showed decreased DNA methylation in cases with PDR. The Natural Killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway was found to be significantly (P = 0.006) enriched among differentially methylated genes in cases with PDR. We also identified differential DNA methylation of 28 CpG sites representing 17 genes (e.g. AHRR, GIPR, GLRA1, and BCOR) with P <0.05 in the prospective cohort, which is more than expected by chance (P = 0.0096).ConclusionsSubjects with T1D and PDR exhibit altered DNA methylation patterns in blood. Some of these epigenetic changes may predict the development of PDR, suggesting that DNA methylation may be used as a prospective marker of PDR.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Elisabet Agardh"", ids = ""3879738""); list(name = ""Annika Lundstig"", ids = ""5792792""); list(name = ""Alexander Perfilyev"", ids = ""144264727""); list(name = ""Petr Volkov"", ids = ""4447856""); list(name = ""Tove Freiburghaus"", ids = ""4814081""); list(name = ""Eero Lindholm"", ids = ""5031598""); list(name = ""Tina RÃ¶nn"", ids = ""3930915""); list(name = ""C D Agardh"", ids = ""144056134""); list(name = ""Charlotte Ling"", ids = ""145266481"")",34403975b78eafee3681a1106c8d2968f9cc8521; 8fb21e5ff05cf7d5bbdadcb5a74071e26e5ab675; 7ce6e103014f09839e970fd7fd7084e7f1b25bf1; e7d605ce5fbc24b89d740207de33f5dc10f9c4fd; 6e0c3c25eb3d0aee16b730f9a8f49d1b091ab900; c495fb72a76d27aba2f2485b84bf897dc80938cc; 520e1d93e7b758540528f8c979dad82a45f025a3; 7b2b4ed3fc3e3911c598e0c61bcfef938e7d146d; 753a2fff0e73fba97088d30923dce1cc28d21ff4; 7d731440df2eef323410598cf3c8dca18c18e388; 10c4c99b6f62d9aa89061030ba6609a316f255e6; 3dfe8ec2bd29c1c53e54f9cd587606921a0a3011; 497fde907996d0f13bad9b059036f62d0e3365e1; 769be7714dad82a38f0bb173fc170b21b3bb6aa1; 9b3f05fbb0e6cbde1f6ce31cbf3548a93858fc73; 776a6e79743140aa1245a2888bc96598b7b22d48; 333de8e59f984a4aa92a310c04a6da2d13ef1148; d389aefe88487f1c03326dfd8392b0fc43c26fd3; b9ca330522c99addae68f7429ec34d9d52f2fbcd; 4b369861668be214a1a8b72f1d9767950949473c; 244b80c5ff4b16ed39367db210f84974c7687810; 010e24d584def4077e56fc9831f935e9d0bc1121; 12f39d1e0233c37aae5d492fc6c88d8b8bbce60b; 411aae91a73b482488fd171877592714cc6fad9a; a060c778f3e183d19a686a1c08fa00b50d135da5; 411628c8d78e39e6d9857e16ddb36806fb560e53; b70ede8bbd6937107e18b88085b7eaf6831b6e38; 17fced447c3309b8c4a5ce16149b001d741f2199; c71d6a2a0812b0d1a70b2a8c6eb9bc0334f1536d; 02423b2df85382c37df8da0b25fce3505161daf7; 94673be0106bc9b942753da6359076384fe6b563; b25e63b09e4349d324a1f862fecdcc8d1b4b264c; 66da20e759c63e7d1005f96b128a3355ff14b095; 41e91a4202ff51f314d40e1ff628dc52b500fb6e; 7dd2f3ee16c03a49c83900c347241158e3f72198; d839fac1907eb5c9d1db2b36fb78d99a312bf611; b40b3a4556a30ffd632de09444a9aa18884601f5; ce97dc3ff23fab7a75852970a4e728e9c769aee0; 76ed437e554ddacd3443d8d3d004ce76d85521d7; 1cba017492582d48cf3577557e69fb1e4178262c,a71cf249c474065374729eae3ed27487b4d306d8; c820e510f3b2095e07bf59a20c184dcf7556c3ae; 4de4185dd36a2e6ddc7a9f38ea86433d254cb17e; 2aee86d5bf73138010a76536183d896a7a5a3200; 1d012ff17137e57ae6fbbb1af99a11ef782c1d5a; f61a4a2c1a9328de7e909997398630f6ba49a8ad; a2054a99abb0929c350585423f7d5576ec6866ff; fd72ed656ab204469dd052a1a66bd6431ac0ec6d; 1a0378fb47aad53f5cba4ea040d4acf3111172f2; 4866c46964529a71a2d3162efbda9b6109fcee21; b769a832f2588a5b2e1f041a477cb398e5c62737; bd059073df860e02e54ac14bf3f846a742ea626d; 24d2acc692a5d7dbabb59b3330f02ec479437ea4; 957fed4fe44b005a8cce18ec76736bee2d436432; 54075c5e2698a65f5c628bba4fa4faf83525de27; 8fa22a3b5344b8ddc28aca068bd70c35ad1a20a1; a53cb535c57d04fa45ea76f00a1e8c11dd3f1ad8; 52d7f20c88570566c32f5ad521c7e0a33a95a671; 7c3c0ee2640680cceb0354a0506f58431ba90ba8; b50a73e940666efe6efa396509d9fd226622ba05; 446856fff04617063bc8d7e141d9d5f60fa19e8b; bdf2b22843334808f50f6d520e51d1429b98d6d4; 40f056b92cb761f85b92dd950acf6a3c8ea21042; 90ae2eb58ca14618920f96622a3a770b366f67b9; b86d7c1cdc1533182fd76eb45af1e0dc5d081dac; 5d7ca818e65d0606561222b3044c7e5f2728eeec; 3f6cbba5ca8783836c0ea52b6a49e64bc3de7ecc; b4e14aff72e18739b4fc47a1c107321481e8640a; 6d8bef5ac9abaa0885f6927d3604742b2e86d538; e30513bb7e741ebb293963de5a23973cbdde615e; 3a52dee24ce2da1e01c4ae709ed0d5b6e51082fc; 395de42d436f5b82ad4d9301f5b5a7ba5a0bd84e; bcbc210d215a7bdf575fb4904bd5bc1ad235dd36; d6c0ac4225604fb79e9bc03e40d19cfaddc0134b; 0abdaba4b960c0583eef21c939cbf9983ef8e177; 0af7632b02105782a8487de40c6b90f6f3004451; 7493c1f8996a0d0f14a6e803d5698e650b90a3bf; 2e401f76f0c19c86e4a4e6c4c31bd1f731737904; edaa140db8b2ed0a609f0a51054a96f280622e56; 80d61cebc4ee50c32c8c00aba0fafda0090d7914,BMC Medicine,13,
b53c08355d250b69b6f5ed4aa58f771373af01e4,Aberrant DNA methylation at genes associated with a stem cell-like phenotype in cholangiocarcinoma tumours,"Genetic abnormalities of cholangiocarcinoma have been widely studied; however, epigenomic changes related to cholangiocarcinogenesis have been less well characterised. We have profiled the DNA methylomes of 28 primary cholangiocarcinoma and six matched adjacent normal tissues using Infiniumâ€™s HumanMethylation27 BeadChips with the aim of identifying gene sets aberrantly epigenetically regulated in this tumour type. Using a linear model for microarray data we identified 1610 differentially methylated autosomal CpG sites with 809 CpG sites (representing 603 genes) being hypermethylated and 801 CpG sites (representing 712 genes) being hypomethylated in cholangiocarcinoma versus adjacent normal tissues (false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05). Gene ontology and gene set enrichment analyses identified gene sets significantly associated with hypermethylation at linked CpG sites in cholangiocarcinoma including homeobox genes and target genes of PRC2, EED, SUZ12 and histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 27. We confirmed frequent hypermethylation at the homeobox genes HOXA9 and HOXD9 by bisulfite pyrosequencing in a larger cohort of cholangiocarcinoma (n = 102). Our findings indicate a key role for hypermethylation of multiple CpG sites at genes associated with a stem cell-like phenotype as a common molecular aberration in cholangiocarcinoma. These data have implications for cholangiocarcinogenesis, as well as possible novel treatment options using histone methyltransferase inhibitors. Cancer Research. on October 26, 2017.

ced372178f368a4999ebd8f1b310f21dcbea5d10,Distinct proteome pathology of circulating microparticles in systemic lupus erythematosus,"BackgroundThe pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is poorly understood but has been linked to defective clearance of subcellular particulate material from the circulation. This study investigates the origin, formation, and specificity of circulating microparticles (MPs) in patients with SLE based on comprehensive MP proteome profiling using patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and healthy donors (HC) as controls.MethodsWe purified MPs from platelet-poor plasma using differential centrifugation of samples from SLE (nÂ =Â 45), SSc (nÂ =Â 38), and two sets of HC (nÂ =Â 35, nÂ =Â 25). MP proteins were identified and quantitated after trypsin digestion by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The abundance of specific proteins was compared between the groups using univariate statistics and false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons. Specific proteins and protein ratios were explored for diagnostic and disease activity information using receiver-operating characteristic curves and by analysis of correlations of protein abundance with disease activity scores.ResultsWe identify and quantitate more than 1000Â MP proteins and show that a subpopulation of SLE-MPs (which we propose to call luposomes) are highly specific for SLE, i.e. not found in MP preparations from HC or patients with another autoimmune, systemic disease, SSc. In SLE-MPs platelet proteins and mitochondrial proteins are significantly diminished, cytoskeletal proteins deranged, and glycolytic enzymes and apoptotic proteins significantly increased.ConclusionsNormal MPs are efficiently removed in SLE, but aberrant MPs, derived from non-lymphoid leukocytes, are less efficiently removed and abundantly produced leading to an altered MP proteome in SLE.

5d57c4f772ad145f6ee30b9e4d5f1a1c118f70dd,The beta-binomial distribution for estimating the number of false rejections in microarray gene expression studies,"In differential expression analysis of microarray data, it is common to assume independence among null hypotheses (and thus gene expression levels). The independence assumption implies that the number of false rejections V follows a binomial distribution and leads to an estimator of the empirical false discovery rate (eFDR). The number of false rejections V is modeled with the beta-binomial distribution. An estimator of the beta-binomial false discovery rate (bbFDR) is then derived. This approach accounts for how the correlation among non-differentially expressed genes influences the distribution of V. Permutations are used to generate the observed values for V under the null hypotheses and a beta-binomial distribution is fit to the values of V. The bbFDR estimator is compared to the eFDR estimator in simulation studies of correlated non-differentially expressed genes and is found to outperform the eFDR for certain scenarios. As an example, this method is also used to perform an analysis that compares the gene expression of soft tissue sarcoma samples to normal tissue samples.",2009,Computer Science; Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel Hunt"", ids = ""145939808""); list(name = ""Cheng Cheng"", ids = ""93250272""); list(name = ""Stan Pounds"", ids = ""153179317"")",2ac47521a557a8fe3773b736ebb7797b9e485d42; 6593aebe761bb0439343638735f5ac8cd0ae5cc0; bb205f0c917f3eb3ee6ea4b323ea34372b245d80; 95448460191e575f99ae5d9714591c300990f083; 9339111f4c1f4df1230d7e866e7df9b1d05dd02c; b5fc82080bff0deb96122781c2e8b45bd2fadb2c; c068a50eb6d1d5df437a825df57a512d608cce69; 1a7ee7b3f6f019a9ae13ef7165968f32e82435ff,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 43db684dc246d0f28a36b7cec3b84f1fe2cef0b4; 0aa74bf87a83a2ab983809d01360a7c3b61c9c4c; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 52fca37f491c76e3daaf53e34741f1d65f91f24a; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; a15e1f238fc526b86c50ee0945b17ea2cee8fbdc; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 5deba0873df5193eb193374c21b68c6336a860e8; 604ee9ce5a7daa35020171b80b23f82eb7b3378a; f731f5810b79982cdd5da5330ee98e54f9c34be4; baad9f10044f722a56e631ec3a80ad8138d1597e; 514de7fd03e14cf5b557b859fddaab2277e45850; ecf663e37b7a42695c8894d781c2ce302b289248; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; c5d8dd126d8a22f1a8b24c23dc04d75e6caebd71; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6,Computational statistics & data analysis,53 5,"

48b1918cf92741723f6b5ddb3b3154983b9a7d08,A preliminary study of the whole-genome expression profile of sporadic and monogenic early-onset Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative dementia. Approximately 10% of cases present at an age of onset before 65 years old, which in turn can be monogenic familial AD (FAD) or sporadic early-onset AD (sEOAD). Mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP genes have been linked with FAD. The aim of our study is to describe the brain whole-genome RNA expression profile of the posterior cingulate area in sEOAD and FAD caused by PSEN1 mutations (FAD-PSEN1). Fourteen patients (7 sEOAD and 7 FAD-PSEN1) and 7 neurologically healthy control subjects were selected and whole-genome expression was measured using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 microarrays. We identified statistically significant expression changes in sEOAD and FAD-PSEN1 brains with respect to control subjects (3183 and 3350 differentially expressed genes [DEG] respectively, false discovery rate-corrected p < 0.05). Of them, 1916 DEG were common between the 2 comparisons. We did not identify DEG between sEOAD and FAD-PSEN1. Microarray data were validated through real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In silico analysis of DEG revealed an alteration in biological pathways related to intracellular signaling pathways (particularly calcium signaling), neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, axon guidance, and long-term potentiation in both groups of patients. In conclusion, the altered biological final pathways in sEOAD and FAD-PSEN1 are mainly related with cell signaling cascades, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory processes. We hypothesize that these 2 groups of early-onset AD with distinct etiologies and likely different could present a neurodegenerative process with potential different pathways that might converge in a common and similar final stage of the disease.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anna Antonell"", ids = ""4338498""); list(name = ""Albert LladÃ³"", ids = ""1397507833""); list(name = ""Jordi Altirriba"", ids = ""49757483""); list(name = ""Teresa Botta-Orfila"", ids = ""1400139778""); list(name = ""JosÃ© LuÃ­s Molinuevo"", ids = ""3620764"")",92bbbb4a93d8d669fe555d51400b01989e00800c; 03007b6d92c1b50ce28892dcc40fb233a8e56fa4; 58a94c541571018444206ebd18863894443d0400; 6d860d25a2cca14fcc48de5758b3b91aa405a328; f43d49e0ad6a27568d5cb269ed8ec119d8a9a353; ebcbb3e9a45da7d4a2a2eca282b991d9dbf756e2; befd9a39a29c29e2708da2d077821e2d3ae73420; 39d632a344cfeb4ab86c3f2652dd39bf5be3fca2; 032b0e06b46684bd469d0fa49b075f290dec4821; ab5e5298753d74a39e4da630d1ad208aab78d016; 398670b950e9a96e290d2fd212e4f875d249aba1; 8ad051e12996a07966ddc9b67c7e98cb2e2d95f5; 74f33c5e92617803262d134f03575afc402e50fc; b7b0f0a6c9962779d8d4f06c5ef6a566de48fff5; 0e0a00de98486dedf6afb31e660c811aaaa9b2cc; 08f696691745c0cee82312f6fad169e6be3e1416; 13080042d1a3e7f0594c0c88da78f536172d6009; 034892a5c1743e69bd0132f61cf23cf65c240717; 360474c808f09978947480d1542661fc32a9113d; 17b106a994b93f0d109bae05ae0566dc319de573; 57dedbd8d72822e9badd8ec47e9ab586c3f7c9ab; 301c6f167000b28c1f32bad67045357e03d20b05; 71c9e8025846a0030b4ace8c3790a9b0c3fbe153; e1d95715c66717596e4286a5aa4b3b75bb4ba5e0; d4e2da7c39d5992d241375351aa9bf7eaab553ea; 9aaf71dde04f8d1951f51a214bdb53c14bcad839; 126ee0802d9b0ff73e8c3f946a6c0204acb4887f; 5a03640914008187b8f97b5de2ce7c903dafa131; dfa8d40629617376a54547d322b5582c6ff300ff; 70ac414f72a070cb28fe425399450a2093b5cf21; 13a6b269fddfd49719d8bea66e68feb391b3a1f0; e1d79df53eb460f743e9bef44b4edae3e78afd09; 41d5195f503d200c37eceb37d4ade2f810b72827; 73496754057e8dd1ee917bc78ff3446256bb4cb6; 8d51a2375eb9dac7c004625a7319c5c972ec7179; 02c241ef60570d3cec13ed25d93d50fddb5b58a0; 32a7595d5d15068196df1b0428aa07bb13882123; 14531037b7c0f4aab460681b81063faf6e10ca34,,Neurobiology of Aging,34,1772-1778
53c7fa740d555df90a2a853ed86b5600e7b7a041,[Genome-wide association study on complex diseases: genetic statistical issues].,"Since the first genome-wide association study on human age-related macular degeneration was reported by Science journal in 2005, a series of genome-wide association studies have been published on human complex diseases or traits, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, Alzheimer's disease and so on. The study of human genetics has recently undergone a dramatic transition which is called ""the first wave of genome-wide association study"". Some issues in statistical analysis of genome-wide association studies were reviewed by this paper. First, statistical analysis guidelines, methods and examples for genome-wide association studies of different designs, including unrelated case-control studies, population-based studies, and family-based association studies; second, multiple testing correction of P values, including Bonferroni correction, step-down Bonferroni correction, permutation correction, and the correction based on false discovery rate; third, population stratification and its effect on inference of genotype-phenotype associations. The False Positive Re-port Probability has been successfully applied in a recent genome-wide association study on coronary artery disease to con-trol the population stratification. Although genetic statistical methodology has been greatly developed in control of false positive associations caused by multiple testing or population stratification, it is still not sufficient to achieve the goal. Replicating genotype-phenotype associations is the only way to identify true association between genetic markers and common disease traits. The first wave of genome-wide association studies is producing an impressive list of unexpected associations between genes or chromosomal regions and a broad range of diseases. Traditional statistical techniques are adequate for the analysis and interpretation of these results. However, much more sophisticated methods of statistical analysis are likely to be required as we delve further into the genome in the search for networks of interacting gene variants, or interactions be-tween gene-gene networks and environmental factors. Finally, some useful links about statistical software for genome-wide association studies were provided.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei-li Yan"", ids = ""20493243"")",9f0f8278d5a6a12b7a44141990c39a4da628c3df; bd8894ddb3e9b072a305d5ce2ecd94b5d61d2a44,,Yi chuan = Hereditas,30 5,"

fd385559017b863c32f3ff57d59cdd52fcfb3f8c,Correlation of the lung microbiota with metabolic profiles in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in HIV infection,"BackgroundWhile 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing has been used to characterize the lungâ€™s bacterial microbiota in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, taxonomic studies provide limited information on bacterial function and impact on the host. Metabolic profiles can provide functional information on host-microbe interactions in the lungs. We investigated the relationship between the respiratory microbiota and metabolic profiles in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected outpatients.ResultsTargeted sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to analyze the bacterial community structure and liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to detect features in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Global integration of all metabolic features with microbial species was done using sparse partial least squares regression. Thirty-nine HIV-infected subjects and 20 HIV-uninfected controls without acute respiratory symptoms were enrolled. Twelve mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) features from C18 analysis were significantly different between HIV-infected individuals and controls (false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰=â€‰0.2); another 79 features were identified by network analysis. Further metabolite analysis demonstrated that four features were significantly overrepresented in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of HIV-infected individuals compared to HIV-uninfected, including cystine, two complex carbohydrates, and 3,5-dibromo-l-tyrosine. There were 231â€‰m/z features significantly associated with peripheral blood CD4 cell counts identified using sparse partial least squares regression (sPLS) at a variable importance on projection (VIP) threshold of 2. Twenty-five percent of these 91â€‰m/z features were associated with various microbial species. Bacteria from families Caulobacteraceae, Staphylococcaceae, Nocardioidaceae, and genus Streptococcus were associated with the greatest number of features. Glycerophospholipid and lineolate pathways correlated with these bacteria.ConclusionsIn bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, specific metabolic profiles correlated with bacterial organisms known to play a role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia in HIV-infected individuals. These findings suggest that microbial communities and their interactions with the host may have functional metabolic impact in the lung.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sushma K.

Whether lateralized periodic discharges (LPDs) represent ictal or interictal phenomena, and even the circumstances in which they may represent one or the other, remains highly controversial. Lateralized periodic discharges are, however, widely accepted as being ictal when they are time-locked to clinically apparent symptoms. We sought to investigate the characteristics of ""ictal"" lateralized periodic discharges (ILPDs) defined by time-locked clinical symptoms in order to explore the utility of using this definition to dichotomize LPDs into ""ictal"" and ""nonictal"" categories.


METHODS
Our archive of all continuous EEG (cEEG) reports of adult inpatients undergoing prolonged EEG monitoring for nonelective indications between 2007 and 2011 was searched to identify all reports describing LPDs. Lateralized periodic discharges were considered ILPDs when they were reported as being consistently time-locked to clinical symptoms; LPDs lacking a clear time-locked correlate were considered to be ""nonictal"" lateralized periodic discharges (NILPDs). Patient charts and available neuroimaging studies were also reviewed. Neurophysiologic localization of LPDs, imaging findings, presence of seizures, discharge outcomes, and other demographic factors were compared between patients with ILPDs and those with NILPDs. p-Values were adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR).


RESULTS
One thousand four hundred fifty-two patients underwent cEEG monitoring at our institution between 2007 and 2011. Lateralized periodic discharges were reported in 90 patients, 10 of whom met criteria for ILPDs. Nine of the patients with ILPDs demonstrated motor symptoms, and the remaining patient experienced stereotyped sensory symptoms. Ictal lateralized periodic discharges had significantly increased odds for involving central head regions (odds ratio [OR]=11; 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.16-62.6; p=0.018, FDR adjusted), with a trend towards higher proportion of lesions involving the primary sensorimotor cortex (p=0.09, FDR adjusted).


CONCLUSIONS
When defined by the presence of a time-locked clinical correlate, ILPDs appear to be strongly associated with a central EEG localization. This is likely due to cortical irritability in central head regions having greater propensity to manifest with positive, clinically apparent, and time-locked symptoms. Thus, dichotomization of ILPDs and NILPDs on this basis principally reflects differences in underlying anatomical locations of the periodic discharges rather than providing a clinically salient categorization.",2014,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Indranil Sengupta"", ids = ""48485347""); list(name = ""Stephan Schuele"", ids = ""2216708""); list(name = ""MÃ­cheÃ¡l P.

7f3e327c07516679a79ecc719ca5f5fa6ded0cc0,Resting state functional connectivity of five neural networks in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.,"BACKGROUND
Bipolar disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) share clinical characteristics and genetic contributions. Functional dysconnectivity across various brain networks has been reported to contribute to the pathophysiology of both SCZ and BPD. However, research examining resting-state neural network dysfunction across multiple networks to understand the relationship between these two disorders is lacking.


METHODS
We conducted a resting-state functional connectivity fMRI study of 35 BPD and 25 SCZ patients, and 33 controls. Using previously defined regions-of-interest, we computed the mean connectivity within and between five neural networks: default mode (DM), fronto-parietal (FP), cingulo-opercular (CO), cerebellar (CER), and salience (SAL). Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to compare groups, adjusting false discovery rate to control for multiple comparisons. The relationship of connectivity with the SANS/SAPS, vocabulary and matrix reasoning was investigated using hierarchical linear regression analyses.


RESULTS
Decreased within-network connectivity was only found for the CO network in BPD. Across groups, connectivity was decreased between CO-CER (p<0.001), to a larger degree in SCZ than in BPD. In SCZ, there was also decreased connectivity in CO-SAL, FP-CO, and FP-CER, while BPD showed decreased CER-SAL connectivity. Disorganization symptoms were predicted by connectivity between CO-CER and CER-SAL.


DISCUSSION
Our findings indicate dysfunction in the connections between networks involved in cognitive and emotional processing in the pathophysiology of BPD and SCZ. Both similarities and differences in connectivity were observed across disorders. Further studies are required to investigate relationships of neural networks to more diverse clinical and cognitive domains underlying psychiatric disorders.",2013,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel Mamah"", ids = ""2057704""); list(name = ""Deanna M.

46e9c8e5aaacc7d32f9691ace98f808fdcbc0309,Gene-based GWAS and biological pathway analysis of the resilience of executive functioning,"Resilience in executive functioning (EF) is characterized by high EF measured by neuropsychological test performance despite structural brain damage from neurodegenerative conditions. We previously reported single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genome-wide association study (GWAS) results for EF resilience. Here, we report gene- and pathway-based analyses of the same resilience phenotype, using an optimal SNP-set (Sequence) Kernel Association Test (SKAT) for gene-based analyses (conservative threshold for genome-wide significance = 0.05/18,123â€‰=â€‰2.8â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’6) and the gene-set enrichment package GSA-SNP for biological pathway analyses (False discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Gene-based analyses found a genome-wide significant association between RNASE13 and EF resilience (pâ€‰=â€‰1.33â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’7). Genetic pathways involved with dendritic/neuron spine, presynaptic membrane, postsynaptic density, etc., were enriched with association to EF resilience. Although replication of these results is necessary, our findings indicate the potential value of gene- and pathway-based analyses in research on determinants of cognitive resilience.",2013,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shubhabrata Mukherjee"", ids = ""2607671""); list(name = ""Sungeun Kim"", ids = ""115146253""); list(name = ""Vijay K.

9101bef75fc2ad41c5483f6df4ec79bc3a970a7b,High-density genotyping of STAT4 reveals multiple haplotypic associations with systemic lupus erythematosus in different racial groups.,"OBJECTIVE
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the prototypical systemic autoimmune disorder, with complex etiology and a strong genetic component. Recently, gene products involved in the interferon pathway have been under intense investigation in terms of the pathogenesis of SLE. STAT-1 and STAT-4 are transcription factors that play key roles in the interferon and Th1 signaling pathways, making them attractive candidates for involvement in SLE susceptibility.


METHODS
Fifty-six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across STAT1 and STAT4 on chromosome 2 were genotyped using the Illumina platform, as part of an extensive association study in a large collection of 9,923 lupus patients and control subjects from different racial groups. DNA samples were obtained from the peripheral blood of patients with SLE and control subjects. Principal components analyses and population-based case-control association analyses were performed, and the P values, false discovery rate q values, and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated.


RESULTS
We observed strong genetic associations with SLE and multiple SNPs located within STAT4 in different ethnic groups (Fisher's combined P = 7.02 x 10(-25)). In addition to strongly confirming the previously reported association in the third intronic region of this gene, we identified additional haplotypic association across STAT4 and, in particular, a common risk haplotype that is found in multiple racial groups. In contrast, only a relatively weak suggestive association was observed with STAT1, probably due to its proximity to STAT4.


CONCLUSION
Our findings indicate that STAT4 is likely to be a crucial component in SLE pathogenesis in multiple racial groups. Knowledge of the functional effects of this association, when they are revealed, might improve our understanding of the disease and provide new therapeutic targets.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Bahram Namjou"", ids = ""152235986""); list(name = ""Andrea L.

25082ffcd27e2a03abd9df0b2506d6a870fed80f,Deficits in Regional Cerebral Blood Flow on Brain SPECT Predict Treatment Resistant Depression.,"BACKGROUND
Depression remains an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, yet few neuroimaging biomarkers are available to identify treatment response in depression.


OBJECTIVE
To analyze and compare functional perfusion neuroimaging in persons with treatment resistant depression (TRD) compared to those experiencing full remission.


METHODS
A total of 951 subjects from a community psychiatry cohort were scanned with perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain in both resting and task related settings. Of these, 78% experienced either full remission (nâ€Š=â€Š506) or partial remission (nâ€Š=â€Š237) and 11% were minimally responsive (nâ€Š=â€Š103) or non-responsive (11%. nâ€Š=â€Š106). Severity of depression symptoms were used to define these groups with changes in the Beck Depression Inventory prior to and following treatment. Voxel-based analyses of brain SPECT images from full remission compared to the worsening group was conducted with the statistical parametric mapping software, version 8 (SPM 8). Multiple comparisons were accounted for with a false discovery rate (pâ€Š<â€Š0.001).


RESULTS
Persons with depression that worsened following treatment had reduced cerebral perfusion compared to full remission in the multiple regions including the bilateral frontal lobes, right hippocampus, left precuneus, and cerebellar vermis. Such differences were observed on both resting and concentration SPECT scans.


CONCLUSION
Our findings identify imaging-based biomarkers in persons with depression related to treatment response. These findings have implications in understanding both depression to prognosis and its role as a risk factor for dementia.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel G.

3c16582e4e65188f6da812d601f0dd2a5e09d246,Reduced small world brain connectivity in probands with a family history of epilepsy.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
The role of inheritance in ascertaining susceptibility to epilepsy is well established, although the pathogenetic mechanisms are still not very clear. Interviewing for a positive family history is a popular epidemiological tool in the understanding of this susceptibility. Our aim was to visualize and localize network abnormalities that could be associated with a positive family history in a group of patients with hot water epilepsy (HWE) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI).


METHODS
Graph theory analysis of rsfMRI (clustering coefficient Î³; path length Î»; small worldness Ïƒ) in probands with a positive family history of epilepsy (FHE+, 25) were compared with probands without FHE (FHE-, 33). Whether a closer biological relationship was associated with a higher likelihood of network abnormalities was also ascertained.


RESULTS
A positive family history of epilepsy had decreased Î³, increased Î» and decreased Ïƒ in bilateral temporofrontal regions compared to FHE- (false discovery rate corrected P â‰¤ 0.0062). These changes were more pronounced in probands having first degree relatives and siblings with epilepsy. Probands with multiple types of epilepsy in the family showed decreased Ïƒ in comparison to only HWE in the family.


CONCLUSION
Graph theory analysis of the rsfMRI can be used to understand the neurobiology of diseases like genetic susceptibility in HWE. Reduced small worldness, proportional to the degree of relationship, is consistent with the current understanding that disease severity is higher in closer biological relations.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""R.

1b4e8451235783d7e46ed62b2aa0bdd1a66d0f97,benchmarkR: an R package for benchmarking genome-scale methods,"1 Summary: benchmarkR is an R package designed to assess and visualize the performance of statistical methods for datasets that have an independent truth (e.g., simulations or datasets with large-scale validation), in particular for methods that claim to control false discovery rates (FDR). We augment some of the standard performance plots (e.g., receiver operating characteristic, or ROC, curves) with information about how well the methods are calibrated (i.e., whether they achieve their expected FDR control). For example, performance plots are extended with a point to highlight the power or FDR at a user-set threshold (e.g., at a methodâ€™s estimated 5% FDR). The package contains general containers to store simulation results (SimResults) and methods to create graphical summaries, such as receiver operating characteristic curves (rocX), false discovery plots (fdX) and power-to-achieved FDR plots (powerFDR); each plot is augmented with some form of calibration information. We find these plots to be an improved way to interpret relative performance of statistical methods for genomic datasets where many hypothesis tests are performed. The strategies, however, are general and will find applications in other domains. 2 Availability: The benchmarkR package is available from: https://github.com/markrobinsonuzh/benchmarkR 3 Contact: mark.robinson@imls.uzh.ch",2015,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Xiaobei Zhou"", ids = ""4891936""); list(name = ""Charity W.

26e42637df1830d833962bd8f3fa026df29cdef0,"A Simple Method for Purification of Vestibular Hair Cells and Non-Sensory Cells, and Application for Proteomic Analysis","Mechanosensitive hair cells and supporting cells comprise the sensory epithelia of the inner ear. The paucity of both cell types has hampered molecular and cell biological studies, which often require large quantities of purified cells. Here, we report a strategy allowing the enrichment of relatively pure populations of vestibular hair cells and non-sensory cells including supporting cells. We utilized specific uptake of fluorescent styryl dyes for labeling of hair cells. Enzymatic isolation and flow cytometry was used to generate pure populations of sensory hair cells and non-sensory cells. We applied mass spectrometry to perform a qualitative high-resolution analysis of the proteomic makeup of both the hair cell and non-sensory cell populations. Our conservative analysis identified more than 600 proteins with a false discovery rate of <3% at the protein level and <1% at the peptide level. Analysis of proteins exclusively detected in either population revealed 64 proteins that were specific to hair cells and 103 proteins that were only detectable in non-sensory cells. Statistical analyses extended these groups by 53 proteins that are strongly upregulated in hair cells versus non-sensory cells and vice versa by 68 proteins. Our results demonstrate that enzymatic dissociation of styryl dye-labeled sensory hair cells and non-sensory cells is a valid method to generate pure enough cell populations for flow cytometry and subsequent molecular analyses.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Meike Herget"", ids = ""7017956""); list(name = ""Mirko Scheibinger"", ids = ""3914232""); list(name = ""Zhaohua Guo"", ids = ""8163120""); list(name = ""Taha Adnan Jan"", ids = ""5666725""); list(name = ""Christopher M Adams"", ids = ""35050098""); list(name = ""Alan G Cheng"", ids = ""144946426""); list(name = ""Stefan Heller"", ids = ""2175249"")",a904d8797f5cb057e7c6111632e824cd3c6e22e7; 948c42ff48b91dd27e846ab7120ad4388c2de4e2; e70b57233a3e3da3a71f283fc1e1cf2273c74d6a; e14630c156de02abb4db5953dc4fd4c478c9115d; aa9646d5a9e17293f0fdd3f1f2e8933f14d9f4c4; 5f978306c87461b75eeb74accebe8546136cfd0c; 5c0ef9cdd23b990a610b09be94a500ae95c3ad35; 34c644ae7463a503917d9a4ba7306ea3c55188fa; e80b364406bb9f8f5201c99fe9fd3e72e7e8b56a,e8aabedc6fbfaf815a919f5e0bfa39040063556d; e95259dc2b16e3cbacee0417e5df8e28b26f60a3; f49233549e568bfa24b17d312089572655f15f89; 50b981c987f59bd8c62662b5e3bb233b2c32ad50; d8d0830492568e67b98839257f0d6dfdb2599c0d; 9291acd762888ffd9ec11fe78e1beb27d77c9560; c0ef6e583c0c23b2e4f9ebc2b5c30f701d7dd586; 6fcd116ae43a02d70da68d4bc18470453973932a; 25c6c38bb9d371639da59d197de24330523e2d6b; fd28436fbcf562872a9a409b337abe20e58f5052; 49e53831091336f1daac708a741da2702b564f8e; 788a70dcdf064377386f6cb604cfb4934cf8d904; bb00e33f008f9caabd78a27cf97120e4e7efc80c; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 018ebcb93ec0c1df0a0037cbc8b09d13b2289b11; eae7b2dc3caca6cf301f6f56b22ee8bfbd9d8c08; 7c8082d8701e6b7af3b03f909a5c46b851a13521; d0d03040236e8aa3c213fe0293179ae5da457764; 052a6e1790c69bc7ddd2828fbac10891fa4f0389; 7bba272190e47aadc64aec0cbd388d9cf22f2cea; f9579809786dd902feaa2abcd2f6b9666a69dd84; d5ed8a47f32bcd2c32f8834cd6047b63d7876b0a; 68a700366be8d2c10bf2dfcf7ee0ce136ec1f42e; 3565fae90e9e33f7855a777fc29ec59d4c2b6009; f798b1b13e67d6e64aa9a236aeef46b73eda80c2; 7a60ac40826fb0d3879ff052750523cbdf4ef9c0; c9b376a4928ae84dad0cf2eacb2bc3d63c14b8d0; b6d5c3dacc313ed5b4bfd7017f62990e237d43ce; c164f750593d4cbd6f75ecc561f9d5ecdbfdf3e5; c6746a90082297b70ce8c0e88f057c35daa832e6; 8dad11ef4f4349236144d04f65b5cef003dc5d05; 8f213ffbfa96f9a3f4fce8282df1a0891a48951c; 416c6e28e6200ed790c516f7a4bf57e813ebe5fa; 1dc62c2f147fd28e4a696e67cefa8e2c1000cb35; 93da74307bf106b88284a3ea427651ba6fa54789; 94a5ca60de98da1082d6190c6e052b5107aa9268; 6e9cb76eddea33f61c6af4f4eeef1018a0651ca1; dfda2d87497295fbd12e0d6b415802c99ecac2e6,PLoS ONE,8,
3c98b592ee138c61c7e6be18f8a53f4fff265a6b,Identification of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Interactions Associated with Survival and Risk In Multiple Myeloma Using Novel Data Mining Methods,"Abstract 2973 

Disease risk and therapeutic outcomes are impacted by both tumor heterogeneity as well as germline variations found in the population. Multiple myeloma (MM) shows significant heterogeneity in genetic aberrations in tumor cells, that together with inherited polymorphisms, affects disease risk and therapeutic response. In order to identify the impact of genetic variations (SNPs) on MM we have developed a Bank On A Cure platform for examining 3404 SNPs, selected in 983 genes associated with pathways affecting cellular functions important in cancer. Using SNP data sets we sought to identify genetic interactions, beyond single univariate association analysis. The challenge was to use data mining methods that take into account relatively small cohorts of patients, in which false discovery rates typically exceed the power of the study. We report results from using novel computational approaches that efficiently identify higher order SNP interactions associated with disease risk as well as survival outcomes, while minimizing the false discovery rate. The BOAC SNP panel was used to develop a data base on 143 patients selected for short ( 3yr) survival in ECOG 9486 and SWOG 9321; as well as 247 newly diagnosed patients and equal number of controls for disease risk analysis. One algorithm developed employs a discriminative pattern mining approach in which defined pathway sets of SNPs are used in combination testing. A second algorithm used identified SNPs that had some association with outcome (survival or disease status); but demonstrated a significant increase in associations when examined in combinations â€“ we refer to this as a p-value jump association. Variations in genes associated with cell cycle, apoptosis, drug metabolism, stress response and immunity reached very low p-values, and survived multiple comparison testing when analyzed in combinations associated with both survival (PFS) predictions as well as analysis of case-control disease risk. Some of the key genetic variations identified in various combinations, included: PTRB, PTEN, CDK5, XRCC4, GSTA4, GPX, DYPD, PCNA, CYP4F2, VEGF, PON1, ALK, and BAG3 . The data mining methods and algorithms used, and specific combinations associated with risk and survival, will be presented. These results are being further validated in new cohorts, and functional implications of identified genetic variants are being investigated in HapMap cell lines.

256f29267c2317228f6a7b65d698326f0a285e36,Resampling-based Multiple Testing for Microarray Data Analysis,"The burgeoning field of genomics has revived interest in multiple testing procedures by raising new methodological and computational challenges. For example, microarray experiments generate large multiplicity problems in which thousands of hypotheses are tested simultaneously. Westfall and Young (1993) propose resampling-based p-value adjustment procedures which are highly relevant to microarray experiments. This article discusses different criteria for error control in resampling-based multiple testing, including (a) the family wise error rate of Westfall and Young (1993) and (b) the false discovery rate developed by Benjamini and Hochberg (1995), both from a frequentist viewpoint; and (c) the positive false discovery rate of Storey (2002a), which has a Bayesian motivation. We also introduce our recently developed fast algorithm for implementing the minP adjustment to control family-wise error rate. Adjusted p-values for different approaches are applied to gene expression data from two recently published microarray studies. The properties of these procedures for multiple testing are compared.",2003,,"list(name = ""Yongchao Ge"", ids = ""2547529"")",8a6c4860bc9183e4eb1173a3f0946c52bbe4e2c3; 99720f62ebbec405a32b5b8c9fc297e8ffa120fb;

f8b853e90c485e4e3812a661f6ab49cf42adf832,Aging of human bone marrow â€“ functional andepigenetic changes in senescent mesenchymalstromal cells,"Aging is a complex process that is associated with changes in many parts of the body 
over the lifespan of an individual. In this work, various aspects of aging in the human 
bone marrow were investigated. 
As the regenerative power of a tissue is linked to the potential of its stem cells to 
replace the accumulated damages, the aging process in somatic stem cells was 
studied focusing on the influence of the niche in regulating stem cell aging. The 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) together with elements that constitute the bone 
marrow niche were investigated as a model for somatic stem cell aging as HSCs are 
accessible in healthy human individuals. The subjects ranged from 20 to 60 years 
with a median age of 33.2 years. 
From each bone marrow sample, the CD34+ population as HSCs and four other cell 
subpopulations, lymphocytes and precursors (LYM), monocytes/macrophages 
precursors (MON), granulocytic (GRA), and erythroid precursors (ERP) were isolated 
by flow cytometry. The mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) were isolated by in vitro 
culture. We found that the relative proportions, cell size as well as cell granularity of 
the major bone marrow constituents did not correlate with the biological age of the 
donors. However, further downstream analysis indicated that age-associated 
changes were prominent on protein level in HSCs as well as in other cell types of the 
niche such as MSCs. 
The interactions between the HSCs and the niche were studied in vitro using a coculture 
system of CD34+ cells and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). As previous 
studies indicated that the supportive function of MSCs as well as their differentiation 
potentials towards adipocytes and osteocytes change significantly with age, we have 
examined the supportive ability of the undifferentiated MSCs versus adipogenically 
differentiated MSCs (ADI-MSCs) and osteogenically differentiated MSCs (OST-MSCs) 
for HSCs. We showed that MSCs, ADI-MSCs and OST-MSCs were able to support 
the proliferation of HSCs and maintain their primitive immunephenotype. Compared 
to undifferentiated MSCs and OST-MSCs, the co-culture with ADI-MSCs increased 
the proliferation of HSCs much stronger while still maintaining the HSCs at a high 
expression level of CD34. 
As the impact of the MSCs on HSCs might be caused by epigenetic changes, the 
aging-associated alterations in the marrow niche were studied at the chromatin level. 
To this end, changes in chromatin accessibility were studied in MSCs by ATAC-seq. 
After establishing the protocol for performing ATAC-seq using primary MSCs, we 
studied the MSC samples derived from 16 healthy human subjects of different ages 
between 21 and 59 years. A set of 122,884 ATAC-seq peaks was identified. We have 
demonstrated that donor age is associated with alterations in open chromatin profiles. 
Moreover, at a false discovery rate of 5%, we could identify 4,579 differential 
chromatin accessible sites upon aging. A functional analysis of these sites showed 
enrichment of cell development and differentiation processes. Additionally, genes of 
the hippo signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, cancer pathways and cell 
adhesion pathways were also found to be enriched. A motif enrichment analysis 
suggested that TATA box motifs and binding sites for transcription factors TFAP2C, 
KLF16, HIC1.p2, WT1 and MTF.p2 were enriched in promoter regions of differential 
chromatin accessible sites upon aging. 
In conclusion, this study showed that the interplay with the stem cell niche controls 
HSC functions. The differentiation of MSCs affects the proliferation and stemness of 
HSCs in vitro. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that aging is associated with 
chromatin accessibility alterations in MSCs, which provides a foundation for further 
in-depth mechanistic analyses.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Ximing Ding"", ids = ""12041454"")",,,,,

Therefore, dairy cattle metabolism has to adapt to meet lactation-associated challenges and requires major functional adjustments of the rumen and whole digestive system. This report describes the use of next-generation sequencing technology for assembly and profiling of the transcriptome of cattle rumen epithelial tissues from cattle in both dry and lactation periods. Transcriptomics profiling and comparison revealed extensive changes in gene expression related to metabolism in rumen epithelial tissue due to the adaptation to lactation. Ruminal epithelial adaptation to the challenges of metabolism and high nutrient requirements during lactation is presumably the primary triggers for these alterations in gene expression. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the gene expression profiles of the rumen epithelia from dry and lactating cattle fall into two very distinct clusters. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that the most GO terms were related to various metabolic processes in lactating cattle. The most significantly (false discovery rate (FDR) p-value < 0.05) enriched GO term in biological processes was â€œcarbohydrate derivative metabolic processâ€, followed by â€œnucleoside metabolic processâ€.

ce3ccde80ccaaa2225b6f495130aefb2cf436e18,The pâ€filter: multilayer false discovery rate control for grouped hypotheses,"Summary 
Â In many practical applications of multiple testing, there are natural ways to partition the hypotheses into groups by using the structural, spatial or temporal relatedness of the hypotheses, and this prior knowledge is not used in the classical Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). When one can define (possibly several) such partitions, it may be desirable to control the group FDR simultaneously for all partitions (as special cases, the â€˜finestâ€™ partition divides the n hypotheses into n groups of one hypothesis each, and this corresponds to controlling the usual notion of FDR, whereas the â€˜coarsestâ€™ partition puts all n hypotheses into a single group, and this corresponds to testing the global null hypothesis). We introduce the p-filter, which takes as input a list of n p-values and Mâ©¾1 partitions of hypotheses, and produces as output a list of n or fewer discoveries such that the group FDR is provably simultaneously controlled for all partitions. Importantly, since the partitions are arbitrary, our procedure can also handle multiple partitions which are non-hierarchical. The p-filter generalizes two classical proceduresâ€”when M=1, choosing the finest partition into n singletons, we exactly recover the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg procedure, whereas, choosing instead the coarsest partition with a single group of size n, we exactly recover the Simes test for the global null hypothesis. We verify our findings with simulations that show how this technique can not only lead to the aforementioned multilayer FDR control but also lead to improved precision of rejected hypotheses. We present some illustrative results from an application to a neuroscience problem with functional magnetic resonance imaging data, where hypotheses are explicitly grouped according to predefined regions of interest in the brain, thus allowing the scientist to employ field-specific prior knowledge explicitly and flexibly.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Rina Foygel Barber"", ids = ""32492090""); list(name = ""Aaditya Ramdas"", ids = ""2556942"")",e71c757f71dbfc10c25b6305429c08eaf830ecec; 2396ec6250ca41bc88b9fd3b47ef1a5faa917b59; a9457a06fb1838e9c250ed2b5b7adcc37f57264c; 9dbb0d0fbceb3174aef95cd87d55270f5dd01444; f46f16ec9ddb69dec6d594ccea38a51ea5e20312; d385eadf84bc1ec6233d6ebe867c3b5f15681622; 47e0eca9f722167c3ec1e9f0ad5d48c81e83d1f8; 28b29ba8db35f001b33240676e3093f8cc73c27f; c794fd003dabe1b4d09ff081ecd9fe0566b729ef; 7e504bfb29d24a97e374b90c0f9ce4bdf1bcc68b; baa6897ce34a07fb17ae473f5cd4e9afe4bc668b; ed1a47384330fa8f306b849a35bfd5e21c7c9ad8; 2073e1c897a6067c662f6889b815427555e1395c; e8e67c6b27b208a3d89197af1b128fe0df5c8bdd; 14ead31c6091beed71880ab1da2dd52876a5dd71; d0686c1edd5b143758a6e567d929eb00fda4eb3c; afc8c291aa589389e6c86407c16a5a646daddaaf; 252ecca39261f9173f11561bdf994b79d60eeb22; 0baa7d9071f95ca44e1945c70824b6a9ba8197fb; 539df2a572349bc3c05328a0ed23c046dc0229e2,,Journal of The Royal Statistical Society Series B-statistical Methodology,79,1247-1268
15626bb2d3496b7c860da4f8e06116dbdad74840,Multiple Testing in Growth Econometrics,"This paper discusses two longstanding questions in growth econometrics which involve multiple hypothesis testing. In cross sectional GDP growth regressions many variables are simultaneously tested for significance. Similarly, when investigating pairwise convergence of output in panel data sets of n countries, n(nâˆ’ 1)/2 tests are performed. We propose to control the false discovery rate (FDR) so as not to erroneously declare variables significant in these multiple testing situations only because of the large number of tests performed. Doing so, we provide a simple new way to robustly select variables in economic growth models. We find that few other variables beyond the initial GDP level are needed to explain growth. We also show that convergence in panels of per capita output using a time series definition with the necessary condition of no unit root in the log per-capita output gap of two economies does not appear to hold.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Thomas Deckers"", ids = ""40492386""); list(name = ""Christoph Hanck"", ids = ""46979625"")",,11c7c3bbccdfb4562cde48eb26503762b122951e; ec9ee35477bd1ecd186131926ca77b38109fec14; 1060a4198617e950116510ff1511c52d85934868; 1812ac84589345edf8c555a0e151f2adeef9dc31; 40021da56953e7fb5403212694c41455aa870418; 73e718754bad3f7f699b75aa86b4ce62af927100; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; a03e6e5b81637b34f9a9a446f0a3158a64befe96; a16a4891f2b2578bf401f10afa846a034bf60b3e; 59268daffc867b8b0e68d41034ebbb16117a9c1c; 05b0d71e861f971e6c6d25af4fb908e0f0c174fe; edb4cf682ef3e5157f0d152a4294bdb626e12c66; 478fc4471a87e7c470069018ace08175637bc5aa; d3f98f511c0e4ffaf16cce79c7b5ff57c7f14b54; 67d30acdf00b9fe230ba290f4b1e001ef042ff5b; ca7aafad45e18a5ca401247da98a8a4cd402c76c; b923645ba8e16e38c6ff7da93524dce66e868f2e,,,
dd2bddc75d4f64e863a590d3c1b6ae362cb1b665,Mirna Expression Profiling and Proteomic Analysis Of Circulating Exosomes From Multiple Myeloma Patients,"Introduction Exosomes are small vesicles (50-100 nm) of endocytic origin, which are released in the extra-cellular milieu by several cell types. It is known that cell-to-cell communication is partially mediated by exosomes. Exosomes play a role in tumor progression where they have been shown to carry and transfer microRNAs (miRNAs) and proteins to the recipient cells. In this study, we sought to characterize circulating exosomes in terms of their ability to modulate the microenvironment, leading to Multiple Myeloma (MM) progression.

Method Exosomes were collected from peripheral blood obtained from healthy individuals (n=5), MGUS patients (n=5) and MM patients (n=10), using ultracentrifugation. Further characterization was carried out using electron microscopy and immunogold labeling for the detection of CD63 and CD81 and for the size using NanosightÂ® analysis. MiRNA were isolated using miRNeasy mini kit (QiagenÂ®) and profiling has been performed using nCounter miRNA expression assay (NanostringÂ® Technologies, Seattle WA). Bioinformatic software tools (TargetScan, MIRDB) were used to predict the target genes of identified miRNA to define their function. Proteins were isolated from exosomes following lysis and precipitated by acetone before in-solution trypsin digestion and ZipTipÂ® purification. Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry (BIDMC Mass Spectrometry, ObiTrap EliteÂ®). Spectral count numbers were determined with a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.5%.

Results Circulating exosomes were studied at ultrastructural level showing positivity for CD81 and CD63, as demonstrated by immunogold labeling and electron microscopy. Exosome number and size did not differ based on clinical stage on NanosightÂ® analysis. We identified 16 miRNAs differentially expressed in circulating exosomes obtained from MGUS patients compared to healthy subjects (FC >2 or <-2; p<0.05): specifically, higher expression of miR-450a, -30e, -125a, -300 and lower expression of miR-185, -150, -98 were observed in MGUS- compared to healthy individual-derived circulating exosomes. Interestingly, miR-30e and -150 modulate NK cell activity by targeting perforin and c-Myb, respectively. We found 96 miRNAs differentially expressed in circulating exosomes from MM patients as compared to healthy donors: specifically lower expression of Let-7 family members, miR-150, -15a and higher expression of miR-125b, -144 and -363 were observed. Interestingly, miR-15a is involved in angiogenesis regulating VEGFA and FGF2. Let-7 family members are tumor suppressors targeting k-Ras and c-Myc and miR-150 regulates CXCR-4 expression. Moreover, these patterns have been described in MM cells suggesting that circulating exosomes in MM are mainly released from MM cells and could play a role in modulating the tumor micro-environment. The mass spectrometry analysis was performed on protein derived from circulating exosomes from 5 healthy donors, 5 MGUS and 10 MM patients. 272 proteins were identified in circulating exosomes including proteins highly associated with exosomes such as CD9, HSP70, Rab proteins (Rab7a; Rab5; Rab27b) and annexins. Comparing MM exosomal proteins to healthy donor exosomal proteins, we found significantly distinctive peptide counts for fibronectin (FC=3.5; p=0.002), AMBP protein (FC=3; p=0.001) and Ig gamma-1 chain C region (FC=2.5; p=0.006). Interestingly, fibronectin expression level in the microenvironment has been reported to be associated with tumor proliferation and drug resistance in MM.

Conclusion These findings indicate that circulating exosomes differ between normal, MGUS and MM patients in terms of miRNA and protein content. Circulating exosomes could potentially be involved in modulating the host microenvironment for specific homing of clonal plasma cells to the bone marrow; thus providing a better understanding of the epigenetic changes responsible for the transition to MM stage.

e918494cadd0b3a54fec579a9e29cafdde520276,A Regression-Based Differential Expression Detection Algorithm for Microarray Studies with Ultra-Low Sample Size,"Global gene expression analysis using microarrays and, more recently, RNA-seq, has allowed investigators to understand biological processes at a system level. However, the identification of differentially expressed genes in experiments with small sample size, high dimensionality, and high variance remains challenging, limiting the usability of these tens of thousands of publicly available, and possibly many more unpublished, gene expression datasets. We propose a novel variable selection algorithm for ultra-low-n microarray studies using generalized linear model-based variable selection with a penalized binomial regression algorithm called penalized Euclidean distance (PED). Our method uses PED to build a classifier on the experimental data to rank genes by importance. In place of cross-validation, which is required by most similar methods but not reliable for experiments with small sample size, we use a simulation-based approach to additively build a list of differentially expressed genes from the rank-ordered list. Our simulation-based approach maintains a low false discovery rate while maximizing the number of differentially expressed genes identified, a feature critical for downstream pathway analysis. We apply our method to microarray data from an experiment perturbing the Notch signaling pathway in Xenopus laevis embryos. This dataset was chosen because it showed very little differential expression according to limma, a powerful and widely-used method for microarray analysis. Our method was able to detect a significant number of differentially expressed genes in this dataset and suggest future directions for investigation. Our method is easily adaptable for analysis of data from RNA-seq and other global expression experiments with low sample size and high dimensionality.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel Vasiliu"", ids = ""40334859""); list(name = ""Samuel E Clamons"", ids = ""5406429""); list(name = ""Molly M.

2fd27fd27b91a62520369e6e28159cb93af585e8,Multiple hypothesis testing in proteomics: a strategy for experimental work.,"In quantitative proteomics work, the differences in expression of many separate proteins are routinely examined to test for significant differences between treatments. This leads to the multiple hypothesis testing problem: when many separate tests are performed many will be significant by chance and be false positive results. Statistical methods such as the false discovery rate method that deal with this problem have been disseminated for more than one decade. However a survey of proteomics journals shows that such tests are not widely implemented in one commonly used technique, quantitative proteomics using two-dimensional electrophoresis. We outline a selection of multiple hypothesis testing methods, including some that are well known and some lesser known, and present a simple strategy for their use by the experimental scientist in quantitative proteomics work generally. The strategy focuses on the desirability of simultaneous use of several different methods, the choice and emphasis dependent on research priorities and the results in hand.

23dcd996e4d64f5e57065bb70cec54e648a5f869,Statistical Inference for Wavelet-denoised Statistical Parametric Maps,"R. Srikanth, R. Casanova, P. J. Laurienti, A. M. Peiffer, J. A. Maldjian Radiology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, United States Introduction A new wavelet based hypothesis testing procedure for statistical parametric maps (SPM) is proposed. The current wavelet based methods [1] apply statistical testing in the wavelet domain wherein the coefficients are thresholded to achieve a specified false rate control. An inverse wavelet transform is then applied to the thresholded wavelet coefficients which results in smoothed SPMs. This necessitates another thresholding in the spatial domain to delineate activated regions from the non-activated regions. This choice of threshold is made arbitrarily and does not guarantee the required false positive rate. In this work, a method is proposed wherein a rejection region (threshold) is fixed and the false discovery rate (FDR) achieved for this threshold is estimated using various FDR estimation methods. This procedure is validated both on simulated and in-vivo fMRI data. Materials and Methods The statistical testing of SPMs requires corrections for multiple comparisons. This is achieved using methods based on measures such as family wise error (FWE) rate or FDRs. Recently, methods based on FDR have been gaining popularity owing to their superior power in statistical testing compared to methods based on FWE. The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) step up approach [2] is one of the most popular methods used for testing SPMs. This method assumes the statistics at each voxel to be independent of each other or that they are related by a specific kind of correlation (the positive regression dependency). A different approach proposed by Yekutieli and Benjamini (YB) [3] is based on resampling and incorporates the correlation structure in the data. This is very important because the voxels in SPMs from neuroimaging data are inherently correlated and this correlation increases with wavelet denoising. Statistical parametric maps generated by the SPM99 package were denoised using the wavelet Bayesian shrinkage method. In our proposed method, these denoised SPMs were thresholded using a fixed threshold and then the FDR control achieved at this threshold was estimated using the B-H and Y-B methods. This threshold was altered until the estimated FDR was below the required rate (0.05). The YB method, which is based on resampling, requires samples from the null distribution of SPMs. These samples were generated using wavestrapping procedures [4]. Two hundred volumes of resampled data were produced based on one SPM that was generated using resting data. Each volume of this resampled data was then subjected to wavelet denoising. The proposed method was first validated on resting data. This data was generated when the subject was not performing any cognitive task. The SPM (consisting of t-scores) was generated using SPM99. A square activation region T-score of value 4 was then added at a known location. The method was then applied to an in-vivo fMRI dataset which was acquired using the same protocol as that of the resting data, but with the addition of a simple auditory detection task during task blocks. Results The left and right panels of figure (1) respectively show the estimated FDR versus threshold using the BH and YB FDR estimation methods for raw and denoised resting data SPMs. The figures also show the actual (act) FDR. From this figure, it can be inferred that both BH and YB performed well when the SPM was not denoised. However, when the SPM was wavelet denoised, the YB method performed better than the BH method. Although YB performs better than BH in the denoised case, the estimated FDRs are below the actual values at conventionally used FDR rates (i.e., 1% and 5% for neuroimaging). Therefore, a better bootstrapping method is required to improve the FDR estimates. Figure (2) shows the result of our proposed method when applied on in-vivo fMRI data. The top and bottom rows show the activation map obtained by applying the YB method on raw and denoised SPMs, respectively. In the case of the raw SPM, a threshold 60% of absolute maximum of the SPM gave about 5% FDR control (top row). In the case of the denoised SPM, a threshold of 25% resulted in an FDR of 7% and a threshold of 30% resulted in an FDR of 0.6% (bottom row). Conclusions An approach for thresholding wavelet-denoised SPMs is proposed. In the case where denoising was not applied, both BH and YB methods gave good estimates of FDR. For the case of wavelet denoised SPMs, the YB method performed better than the BH method.",2005,,"list(name = ""Ryali Srikanth"", ids = ""40504601""); list(name = ""Robert Casanova"", ids = ""145241085""); list(name = ""Paul J.

e5914f05f8bed1cb695eefb89f4305b5232e1d95,Gender Differences in Genetic Risk Profiles for Cardiovascular Disease,"BACKGROUND
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence, complications and burden differ markedly between women and men. Although there is variation in the distribution of lifestyle factors between the genders, they do not fully explain the differences in CVD incidence and suggest the existence of gender-specific genetic risk factors. We aimed to estimate whether the genetic risk profiles of coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic stroke and the composite end-point of CVD differ between the genders.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
We studied in two Finnish population cohorts, using the case-cohort design the association between common variation in 46 candidate genes and CHD, ischemic stroke, CVD, and CVD-related quantitative risk factors. We analyzed men and women jointly and also conducted genotype-gender interaction analysis. Several allelic variants conferred disease risk for men and women jointly, including rs1801020 in coagulation factor XII (HR = 1.31 (1.08-1.60) for CVD, uncorrected p = 0.006 multiplicative model). Variant rs11673407 in the fucosyltransferase 3 gene was strongly associated with waist/hip ratio (uncorrected p = 0.00005) in joint analysis. In interaction analysis we found statistical evidence of variant-gender interaction conferring risk of CHD and CVD: rs3742264 in the carboxypeptidase B2 gene, p(interaction) = 0.009 for CHD, and rs2774279 in the upstream stimulatory factor 1 gene, p(interaction) = 0.007 for CHD and CVD, showed strong association in women but not in men, while rs2069840 in interleukin 6 gene, p(interaction) = 0.004 for CVD, showed strong association in men but not in women (uncorrected p-values). Also, two variants in the selenoprotein S gene conferred risk for ischemic stroke in women, p(interaction) = 0.003 and 0.007. Importantly, we identified a larger number of gender-specific effects for women than for men.


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
A false discovery rate analysis suggests that we may expect half of the reported findings for combined gender analysis to be true positives, while at least third of the reported genotype-gender interaction results are true positives. The asymmetry in positive findings between the genders could imply that genetic risk loci for CVD are more readily detectable in women, while for men they are more confounded by environmental/lifestyle risk factors. The possible differences in genetic risk profiles between the genders should be addressed in more detail in genetic studies of CVD, and more focus on female CVD risk is also warranted in genome-wide association studies.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kaisa Silander"", ids = ""5859551""); list(name = ""Mervi Alanne"", ids = ""32864062""); list(name = ""Kati Kristiansson"", ids = ""4343816""); list(name = ""Olli Saarela"", ids = ""2657477""); list(name = ""Samuli Ripatti"", ids = ""2407947""); list(name = ""Kirsi Auro"", ids = ""5857594""); list(name = ""Juha Karvanen"", ids = ""2145872""); list(name = ""Sangita Kulathinal"", ids = ""46899411""); list(name = ""Matti NiemelÃ¤"", ids = ""1941373""); list(name = ""Pekka Ellonen"", ids = ""3888699""); list(name = ""Erkki Vartiainen"", ids = ""2105906""); list(name = ""Pekka J Jousilahti"", ids = ""4382762""); list(name = ""Janna Saarela"", ids = ""2948972""); list(name = ""Kari Kuulasmaa"", ids = ""3708923""); list(name = ""Alun Evans"", ids = ""48136620""); list(name = ""Markus Perola"", ids = ""2548112""); list(name = ""Veikko V Salomaa"", ids = ""2960501""); list(name = ""L.

698d01c8d75cdc6837915489b8cb849a63bdba29,"Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus, cortical thinning, and the cerebrospinal fluid tap test","When considering the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involved in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), white matter is often the main locus of investigation. However, when an axon in the brain is damaged, degeneration of the neuron can occur proximally (dying back) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with cortical thinning, is a common pathologic comorbidity with iNPH. We investigated differences in cortical thickness between CSF tap test (CSFTT) responders and non-responders in iNPH patients and compared patterns of cortical thickness in iNPH patients with that of AD patients. Thirty-two iNPH patients (16 CSFTT responders and 16 CSFTT non-responders) and 16 AD patients were imaged with MRI, including 3-dimensional volumetric images for cortical thickness analysis across the entire brain. Among the iNPH patients, CSFTT non-responders, when compared to responders, had statistically significant cortical thinning in the left superior frontal gyrus at the level of a false discovery rate (FDR) p<0.05, and tended to show widespread cortical thinning in most areas of the brain. Relative to the CSFTT responders, AD patients showed statistically significant cortical thinning in superior and medial frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, paracentral lobule, precuneus, and superior parietal lobule after FDR correction (p<0.05). However, comparing patterns of cortical thinning between AD patients and CSFTT non-responders revealed no statistically significant differences. Differences in cortical thickness correlated with CSFTT response for iNPH patients may indicate a possibility for considering patterns of cortical thinning in patients with ventriculomegaly as potential brain imaging markers for the prediction of CSFTT responders. And, our findings suggest that comorbid AD pathology might be related to the cortical thinning patterns found in CSFTT non-responders. Larger studies, using normal controls and combinations of other biomarkers associated with AD, would be necessary to evaluate these hypotheses.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kyunghun Kang"", ids = ""4413107""); list(name = ""Uicheul Yoon"", ids = ""145576016""); list(name = ""Jong-Min Lee"", ids = ""114325943""); list(name = ""Ho-Won Lee"", ids = ""3164690"")",e0eb7b07a28a4515bbd6cd506874a893e1146700; d4de66b1ba89b196c411ec77e5df3c15e800ff0a; 9eac340162bfcaf1a2af8b6bbfdfebca346d21b1; 4b17f8e3860c3417962934699062eb6cf0161892; 08ad7b5ad0fad0bc490d907cec3a62e96f5d0439; 2c85437909bc4d0874343c96b9013bc598cc6e50; ac2a909ce19e9227407d79514f6a6d4ec85da17b; 49af3e4ea89b2b4f668c086a5d9d4fc294ebd5c8; 5d53f28ca518b421447dd3f5c828fbbdf1a48742; 0cfc4fd003d5b9cb51d898fe9239b17930751bcf; ad8bd222550de3c731d204bee898f321df94e58a; 030cb9f6fdc735dcf9455e594e5bfd00daacfcc7,7e45db4589da884042a2d464d714e66363b168f2; 216f5100f0bba2bb7f211a873e74f0dc90602cc5; cd7361d934fb3f2516aebd1479951ca7af21647f; 86d13cadcc44fc6d2142f9f2f0a6d7f20371684a; 5ab9562253b78ee363c9ce75affe683893367f4e; cced3000beccfb263589e7e3292a7e159e50f42f; eb0807e411a9558cb8081594aeaeb8f4182edcff; 79298fc597edc6a2790c7c7916b00ecc0caa4299; 71276d36707dd13569d26b99271a8cb10745180f; 86110f55696e95a1ef54e38c9bf3702cc4e00cee; 6ac725cece0be5e556ebf96cc3cacf0c8b0dd14a; 2c0f1fc88b25e5a5fbddef1f9969e4e38a841242; 396578e7a06108b4ca4e6256d03623a735e3b141; 273616425a8f6159bd341d64f0e91d4627a14b4f; aeca4a5d7578ed73c29bd90731a7a23c009477c6; 9de1a4486c098564a91615de0d3bfc5db929a566; c678f6e8052cba3661e494f5a570114e687e8f81; 2601e175dce2f7615daed600db5a7dc34e616017; 4f78d49a1b9d687ff89620683d3f9aac4ff0a929; a2cc381fc1af7488775747409bdcaf5a84ff294f; 38cee36ac383568e5f020ecfeebed40264c9c6ad; 651b841bc200e3cfdd0eabb6e485fee6019862d9; 644f93debd08254860e4f28e1ebd1a0a93fa10e4; 8838ee1e5d85264afcb21aa9d71cd25d9de36e5e; 37d2d04f8c09da1f0cf8434a38a51841b5b703bf; 4df6b80ae3cf353a9ff405403589e9a31d524199; 71c3577003ddf08427b259b3f8fb6c831e02ea37; 18151a649e6c3418853ca5cc28a665533c866081; 0252c304b90a6d7ffb0d9f3af676b71e9fe0f23f; 26dac98917589ce43a9eb21b74c5e4592bc89e2c; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; 3b3bb3899f3adc417926bc2e5ca85c4fd545c50c; 3864272cc373aae9e1e467541f8cb733d05278b8; fd91832bc3e18560fa1a1ef1726c1b0162579a74; 5b555d52840b741c2e603b5e8ada5fe3d384c576; db0e738e930c49d726b1c0ae98735b02a8be6c16; 9b9bac47455f124362f5bb3012d93fbe4904c375; aece730c7fadf882796a1d26f407932355c55a4b; 66e8e08bc6db68527abf47e4c3a43ce4513a4e96; 1628254239e55aa07e0c1cd912a0d8f27fab9018; 57b591b731b31e3be196adebed097b081d101812; f1ae1e66947a7981ab39897f8778b2398556eb3d; 9f27b53dcbc50ef85af65553780b6a5a9641267c; ea23f3b334f6c95c654a4888c563e3a161c4dff6; 1dddfba077f5396ffc3d1da44f7426109fd55d99; 8bea6bbea4ffc9f08e7dcefcb90cdb95397e6997; aed8dfc7dd76d6ca5a8c1660190a758d632224dc; 8e38a3fd905002db884b84aa11137eaa8e56bdf0; ec8802111e364c97cc5b8f49145a9b29129f76c9; acd2e0ba8ac0fce8116c359a68db24d0e42ecb58; 5a0d82ca0e62f2ba222dd37886b5a6b83837ee6a; 15c9b714091942a30077a2aab94aa5c6ff2dcfbc; be822d784078feaa029877816a78db3b1dae05a8; 28d3dcfb803552d993466e7689ab32dfb4aa0c7f; a5728230c995efc6ff76399a89a77b3baa930284; d324d40e61f10dd133f3078f2f6919ab93a5ac14; db093087ee54a54c27554ae700683d624f4b4f62; 3938a20567a9387277502fceca767ea507b0d31a; b5fc2530766c5988f082cbe2d0cf2a7c829cec23; 450cc61a3a0604ccc270fb678a2c2744aaceb2f7,Journal of the Neurological Sciences,334,55-62

9ca285f88ce9c1e389766aea9fe11b346d15ff79,Quantitative leukocyte BDNF promoter methylation analysis in bipolar disorder,"BackgroundBipolar disorder (BD) is a complex psychiatric phenotype with a high heritability and a multifactorial etiology. Multisite collaborative efforts using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified only a portion of DNA sequence-based risk factors in BD. In addition to predisposing DNA sequence variants, epigenetic misregulation may play an etiological role in BD and account for monozygotic twin discordance, parental origin effects, and fluctuating course of BD. In this study, we investigated DNA methylation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene in BD.MethodsFifty participants with BD were compared to the same number of age- and sex-matched controls for DNA methylation differences at BDNF promoters 3 and 5. DNA methylation reads were obtained using a mass spectrophotometer for 64 cytosine-guanine (CpG) sites in 36 CpG â€˜unitsâ€™ across three amplicons of BDNF promoters 3 and 5.Results and DiscussionMethylation fractions differed between BD participants and controls for 11 of 36 CpG units. Five CpG units, mostly in promoter 5, remained significant after false discovery rate correction (FDR) (p values â‰¤ 0.004) with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen's d â‰¥ 0.61). Several of the significant CpGs overlapped with or were immediately adjacent to transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) - including two of the FDR-significant CpG units in promoter 5. For the CpGs in promoter 3, there was a positive and significant correlation between age at sample collection and DNA methylation fraction (rho = 0.56, p = 2.8 Ã—10âˆ’5) in BD cases, but not in controls. Statistically significant differences in mean methylation fraction at 5/36 CpG units (after FDR), some at or immediately adjacent to TFBSs, suggest possible relevance for the current findings to BD etiopathogenesis. The positive correlation between age and methylation seen in promoter 3 is consistent with age-related decline in BDNF expression previously reported. Future studies should provide more exhaustive epigenetic study of the BDNF locus to better characterize the relationship between BDNF methylation differences and BD.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""John Strauss"", ids = ""47978944""); list(name = ""Tarang Khare"", ids = ""4835200""); list(name = ""Vincenzo De Luca"", ids = ""40585923""); list(name = ""Richie Jeremian"", ids = ""5379411""); list(name = ""James L Kennedy"", ids = ""1820109""); list(name = ""John B.

66d80625401d3fa1e366edcc057191aa7ef741a5,How many biological replicates are needed in an RNA-seq experiment and which differential expression tool should you use?,"RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20%-40% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to >85% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve >85% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at â‰²5% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nicholas J.

e3ba4d20aa1fff3782050b2828ce3e895c16ce48,The DNA hypermethylation phenotype of colorectal cancer liver metastases resembles that of the primary colorectal cancers,"Identifying molecular differences between primary and metastatic colorectal cancersâ€”now possible with the aid of omics technologiesâ€”can improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms of cancer progression and facilitate the discovery of novel treatments for late-stage cancer. We compared the DNA methylomes of primary colorectal cancers (CRCs) and CRC metastases to the liver. Laser microdissection was used to obtain epithelial tissue (10 to 25â€‰Ã—â€‰106â€‰Î¼m2) from sections of fresh-frozen samples of primary CRCs (n =â€‰6), CRC liver metastases (n =â€‰12), and normal colon mucosa (n =â€‰3). DNA extracted from tissues was enriched for methylated sequences with a methylCpG binding domain (MBD) polypeptide-based protocol and subjected to deep sequencing. The performance of this protocol was compared with that of targeted enrichment for bisulfite sequencing used in a previous study of ours. MBD enrichment captured a total of 322,551 genomic regions (249.5â€‰Mb or ~â€‰7.8% of the human genome), which included over seven million CpG sites. A few of these regions were differentially methylated at an expected false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% in neoplastic tissues (primaries: 0.67%, i.e., 2155 regions containing 279,441 CpG sites; liver metastases: 1%, i.e., 3223 regions containing 312,723 CpG sites) as compared with normal mucosa samples. Most of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs; 94% in primaries; 70% in metastases) were hypermethylated, and almost 80% of these (1882 of 2396) were present in both lesion types. At 5% FDR, no DMRs were detected in liver metastases vs. primary CRC. However, short regions of low-magnitude hypomethylation were frequent in metastases but rare in primaries. Hypermethylated DMRs were far more abundant in sequences classified as intragenic, gene-regulatory, or CpG shelves-shores-island segments, whereas hypomethylated DMRs were equally represented in extragenic (mainly, open-sea) and intragenic (mainly, gene bodies) sequences of the genome.

Next generation sequencing of primary lymphoma samples has identified common recurring genomic alterations (GAs). The distribution and frequency of recurring GAs across lymphoma subtypes remains unknown because prior studies vary in sequencing methods, depth of coverage, and specimen source. In this study, we benchmark the distribution of GAs across different lymphoma subtypes by prospectively analyzing lymphoma cases and performing comprehensive DNA/RNA targeted sequencing of genes commonly found in hematologic malignancies using the Foundation One Heme (F1H) clinical assay. Methods: After obtaining proper consent, archived specimens from 183 samples [formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) N=141, peripheral blood N=28, BM aspirate N=14] distributed across lymphoma subtypes (including 62 DLBCL, 38 T cell lymphoma, 32 FL, 17 CLL, 13 MCL) were sequenced to high, uniform coverage averaging >600x for DNA, >20 million pairs for RNA. GAs were determined, including base substitutions, small insertions and deletions, rearrangements, and copy number alterations. Significant non-synonymous variants were identified as mutations from the COSMIC database, amplifications of established oncogenes, or homozygous deletions and/or clear loss-of-function mutations of known tumor suppressors. Fisher9s exact test with Monte Carlo estimation corrected by false discovery rate was used for associations. Results: Samples from prospectively consented patients were banked for a median of 30 days prior to genomic analysis, range 1 day to 6.5 yr. Sequencing data was reported a median of 16 days from sample date receipt. GAs were identified in 95% of samples, with a median of 4 GAs/sample. The most common GAs were TP53 (29%), MLL2 (27%), BCL2 (25%), CDKN2A/B (17%) and CREBBP (14%). Alterations of chromatic modifiers (80%), BCR/NFkB components (51%), and cell cycle pathway (44%) were most common. In our group of unpaired follicular lymphoma samples (N=7 treatment naive, N=25 treatment exposed), the number of GAs increased with treatment exposure. We found similar gene and biological signatures regardless of prior therapy; however differences emerge in genes of potential clinical relevance. Sequencing profiles augmented or altered the pathologic diagnosis in 11 of 183 (6%) of the cases. Importantly we were able to classify the GAs as actionable, potentially actionable and variants of unclear significance to better define the clinical relevance of targeted genomic sequencing. Conclusions: Integration of comprehensive next generation targeted genomic sequencing and clinical analysis in lymphoma provides an opportunity to describe the spectrum and incidence of GAs across different lymphoma subtypes and provide guidance on application of genomic profiling. This work serves to benchmark GAs across all lymphoma subtypes in a clinically relevant population and enables design of basket trials selecting patients based on shared genomic and biologic similarity instead of lymphoma subtype. To our knowledge, this is the largest repository of clinically annotated genomic sequencing in lymphoma. Disclosures Palomba:Janssen: Consultancy.

a43c8653de878a29662e5b238fec5c8a39ae8dde,Identification of the acclimation genes in transcriptomic responses to heat stress of White Pekin duck,"White Pekin duck is an important meat resource in the livestock industries. However, the temperature increase due to global warming has become a serious environmental factor in duck production, because of hyperthermia. Therefore, identifying the gene regulations and understanding the molecular mechanism for adaptation to the warmer environment will provide insightful information on the acclimation system of ducks. This study examined transcriptomic responses to heat stress treatments (3 and 6Â h at 35Â Â°C) and control (C, 25Â Â°C) using RNA-sequencing analysis of genes from the breast muscle tissue. Based on three distinct differentially expressed gene (DEG) sets (3H/C, 6H/C, and 6H/3H), the expression patterns of significant DEGs (absolute log2Â >Â 1.0 and false discovery rateÂ <Â 0.05) were clustered into three responsive gene groups divided into upregulated and downregulated genes. Next, we analyzed the clusters that showed relatively higher expression levels in 3H/C and lower levels in 6H/C with much lower or opposite levels in 6H/3H; we referred to these clusters as the adaptable responsive gene group. These genes were significantly enriched in the ErbB signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and type II diabetes mellitus in the KEGG pathways (PÂ <Â 0.01). From the functional enrichment analysis and significantly regulated genes observed in the enriched pathways, we think that the adaptable responsive genes are responsible for the acclimation mechanism of ducks and suggest that the regulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase genes including PIK3R6, PIK3R5, and PIK3C2B has an important relationship with the mechanisms of adaptation to heat stress in ducks.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jun Mo Kim"", ids = ""47964521""); list(name = ""Kyu-sang Lim"", ids = ""120441999""); list(name = ""Mijeong Byun"", ids = ""39724450""); list(name = ""Kyung-Tai Lee"", ids = ""34668931""); list(name = ""Young-rok Yang"", ids = ""49307705""); list(name = ""Mina Park"", ids = ""46338079""); list(name = ""Dajeong Lim"", ids = ""144229667""); list(name = ""Han-Ha Chai"", ids = ""6011531""); list(name = ""Han-Tae Bang"", ids = ""98762263""); list(name = ""Jong Hwangbo"", ids = ""40552808""); list(name = ""Yang-Ho Choi"", ids = ""40546725""); list(name = ""Yong-Min Cho"", ids = ""48747084""); list(name = ""Jun-Seok Park"", ids = ""48491097"")",fd5d2c1e515f592c016f87f065a4dadb3fc71577; 02d5ae91b3c748c542c258e1fed43fcdaf849f7f; 60963f868662cd427c00b5319dde28f738ca51fc; be0e33e5232d5d427511e928a88c0f253bef8128; b7900002f64126d79f0a1af5d1579bfb4e332b63,7a71502287fffef883e2aaa41f80a9e615bb7cd7; 529874ec62a89a90092e985beb251e0375dbd8fd; 590497ff11c08dc32db1f2d6972a20a4633eda89; 0c2c75bab0bf26364cdd5ce584beae24e0155273; 0b09e038d4ed9f161e30982cd50d5e3c4f03d4b2; 2fe106aecea8da700891b04a0662153509b04518; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; f990948a6339978dab5082af445f90065150ba81; cc90910b6e31fe44cddc1e341f21eec0aaa5db44; f7c1ea8a242e0e2317f3148e7aaf065677ee0cd5; 8bda07396bd4f208ef2c9917dbd9455fb54a7233; 623811c52a3f09aeb03e56d4cafe32d6bec20ba5; 51611bf47ae6e1c430a3ca2abdf89ec21e8ca53e; 1cbd5151c5cb510ea61f66b5f6015814d5719f81; 70e0e13f11abb01c4a71a1b95cb2f473eb04e7e5; bd43a201e597c87cc96ed4e8f7b6baacfc9e3f27; 6ad43def0be50513680b248a294039d77b45f00d; 6b69c472a9c073e2e92c70a354fda1662e810be0; 765c6ca958b6bac886d582251575c48d0872dbb5; 33eb331708ffadb5b77caa5af1ee5cbc939b3e31; d0537a546f419b84356b9811bea6b7a6608fbfbb; 2074dcf24936afeb666d234468edeb8a50de996b; 68a0ca5a64ee9bac2c30af48a03fcbc719459d1c; 5aab4e34037bab33f890a2f24b85ed9e5a1823bf; 0e2fe165dc627220cc711e1e03b8bea599112884; aad9b29a831dd8599e34b4f9aedb66691f08c92c; 9e9fd15ffb20d61093cd20357a3fee16f3153f58; d0fca2ed42b4a0c1b9f7e7b313e8c53adca53ad5; c0b112bc14f77c4462fd52c6ea91b31bb431c8ee; efd323b3a849810ad1f34a79eba66c5f7980c3b3; 91dcad71488dcf51118d1e6844bd4b3ea8fe1f03; a82586c65073a1971259f2cfe2122e0ff03e2a09; 632dbb4b4dd0655bef698783c1f6c7e05f5cacf2; 4a008ada4171f5a3d95e672e758180d86bc85cd4; c0450f920c178d25e7707fa00432516fa6a96ce5,Cell Stress and Chaperones,22,787-797
b8ca091daae94af02892fc1c89005baa4b7eb606,Words that Matter for Asset Pricing: The Case of IPOs,"We examine how useful the popular Loughran and McDonald (2011, LM) tonal word lists are for extracting information in IPO prospectuses about first-day returns. We find that there is much more information in word use than captured by the LM tonal lists. We show that the connection between LM lists and returns is nuanced and inconsistent; it belies simple tonal narratives. Specifically, we assess frequency of use, predictive content, comprehensiveness, and consistency of predictive impact for the LM lists. Words in the negative, positive, uncertainty, and weak-modal lists occur in IPO prospectuses more frequently than random, but only the negative and uncertainty words collectively predict first-day returns. We develop a new method based on the False Discovery Rate (FDR) to identify words that affect IPO tail returns. We measure the amount of information in the LM lists compared to these FDR words and find that the LM lists are not comprehensive because they capture only a small fraction of the information in words associated with returns. We also find that the impact of LM words on first-day returns is a fraction of the impact of FDR words. We show that the LM word lists send inconsistent signals on pricing to investors: some LM words on the same lists are positively correlated with first-day IPO returns, whereas others are negatively correlated.",2014,Economics,"list(name = ""Raymond P.

small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been improved over the last 
decades but still little is known about the influence of 
chromosomal imbalances on the course of the disease. In this 
retrospective study the genome of 80 NSCLC is analyzed in terms of 
chromosomal imbalances by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). 
Next to the comparison of the aberrations of adenocarcinomas (AC) 
and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and the aberrations of short- 
and long-term survivors the study analyzes how single aberrations 
affect the patients survival time. To identify relations between 
aberrations and clusters of cooccuring aberrations, an oncogenetic 
tree model for both entities is used. The study bases on a database 
with 340 patients who were operated on lung cancer in the 
Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery of the University 
Medical Center of Gottingen from 1999 to 2006. Overall survival 
rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared 
between groups by the logrank test. For comparing 
clinico-pathologic data and incidence of aberrations 
Mann-Whitney-U-test and Fisher's exact test were used. To reduce 
the risk of false positive events p-values were adjusted by the 
false discovery rate (FDR). The oncogenetic tree model is based on 
maximum likelihood estimation. Besides previously observed 
aberrations gains on 16p, 5q and 8p were frequent events in AC and 
losses on 18q were frequent events in SCC of this study. In 
comparison to AC, SCC showed more gains on 3q, more losses on 3p 
and significantly more amplifications. There was a tendency that 
gains on 12q were associated with short-term survival whereas gains 
on 1q and 5p as well as losses on 18q were associated with 
long-term survival. Moreover gains on 12q were associated with a 
low 5-year survival rate and gains on 5p were associated with a 
high 5-year survival rate. However, the difference was not 
significant. The reconstruction of the oncogenetic tree model 
suggested a higher genetic instability for SCC. 
The different patterns of chromosomal imbalances are potentially 
responsible for different clinical behaviour, histological 
differentiation and differences in disease progression.

The Mediterranean (MED) diet has been associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases. It is unclear whether this health effect can be mainly contributed to high intakes of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), characteristic for the MED diet, or whether other components of a MED diet also play an important role.


METHODS AND RESULTS
A randomized fully controlled parallel trial is performed to examine the effects of the consumption of a saturated fatty acid rich diet, a MUFA-rich diet, or a MED diet for 8 weeks on metabolite profiles, in 47 subjects at risk of the metabolic syndrome. A total of 162 serum metabolites are assessed before and after the intervention by using a targeted NMR platform. Fifty-two metabolites are changed during the intervention (false discovery rate [FDR] pÂ <Â 0.05). Both the MUFA and MED diet decrease exactly the same fractions of LDL, including particle number, lipid, phospholipid, and free cholesterol fraction (FDR pÂ <Â 0.05). The MED diet additionally decreases the larger subclasses of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), related VLDL fractions, VLDL-triglycerides, and serum-triglycerides (FDR pÂ <Â 0.05).


CONCLUSION
The findings clearly demonstrate that the MUFA component is responsible for reducing LDL subclasses and fractions, and therefore causes an antiatherogenic lipid profile. Interestingly, consumption of the other components in the MED diet show additional health effects.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Charlotte J R Michielsen"", ids = ""11403797""); list(name = ""Roland W.

38de958f9b2497a7dd80e9a67ed90bac8125a429,Epigenome-wide association study of breast cancer using prospectively collected sister study samples.,"BACKGROUND
Previous studies have suggested DNA methylation in blood is a potential epigenetic marker of cancer risk, but this has not been evaluated on a genome-wide scale in prospective studies for breast cancer.


METHODS
We measured DNA methylation at 27578 CpGs in blood samples from 298 women who developed breast cancer 0 to 5 years after enrollment in the Sister Study cohort and compared them with a random sample of 612 cohort women who remained cancer free. We also genotyped women for nine common polymorphisms associated with breast cancer.


RESULTS
We identified 250 differentially methylated CpGs (dmCpGs) between case subjects and noncase subjects (false discovery rate [FDR] Q < 0.05). Of these dmCpGs, 75.2% were undermethylated in case subjects relative to noncase subjects. Women diagnosed within 1 year of blood draw had small but consistently greater divergence from noncase subjects than did women diagnosed at more than 1 year. Gene set enrichment analysis identified Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes cancer pathways at the recommended FDR of Q less than 0.25. Receiver operating characteristic analysis estimated a prediction accuracy of 65.8% (95% confidence interval = 61.0% to 70.5%) for methylation, compared with 56.0% for the Gail model and 58.8% for genome-wide association study polymorphisms. The prediction accuracy of just five dmCpGs (64.1%) was almost as good as the larger panel and was similar (63.1%) when replicated in a small sample of 81 women with diverse ethnic backgrounds.

426efb76f5e8bb9b6b9faf82e7e540844dd4da11,Multiple influential point detection in high dimensional regression spaces,"Influence diagnosis is an integrated component of data analysis but has been severely underinvestigated in a high dimensional regression setting. One of the key challenges, even in a fixed dimensional setting, is how to deal with multiple influential points that give rise to masking and swamping effects. The paper proposes a novel group deletion procedure referred to as multiple influential point detection by studying two extreme statistics based on a marginalâ€correlationâ€based influence measure. Named the minâ€ and maxâ€statistics, they have complementary properties in that the maxâ€statistic is effective for overcoming the masking effect whereas the minâ€statistic is useful for overcoming the swamping effect. Combining their strengths, we further propose an efficient algorithm that can detect influential points with a prespecified false discovery rate. The influential point detection procedure proposed is simple to implement and efficient to run and enjoys attractive theoretical properties. Its effectiveness is verified empirically via extensive simulation study and data analysis. An R package implementing the procedure is freely available.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Junlong Zhao"", ids = ""48019224""); list(name = ""Chao Liu"", ids = ""47535396""); list(name = ""Lu Niu"", ids = ""48448977""); list(name = ""Chenlei Leng"", ids = ""145727325"")",c4dce8d62591302e5b5cc40b1a7493d98e2bf5b7,b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 497de05718257c700b423d8dac168b0f9db66848; e5208097b88a4f0d73c28c3c669b17ed8f369c22; 45574c2b8f3438735bf12ed003c1e524351ea8d4; e76f9b50325d44b06e2b90ac65996afd5a06b4d8; 93a36bc44cc963d52f8ded88f5f67f823294a05a; 5f0d051ffcbde45f92daee6395883cd476777ad9; baa7a8bf95e4d4480a6656af72c7f25a187cecaa; 7d1fada464142825480260bc0b81ee70a1641989; c551c6e002ac4a6633476ffd8d97d90336d6c668; e41f933dbda8dfef85e865935435299aeafb4559; 34db624a496cb92717e911ca6986d977aa541fc3; 54c13129cbbc8737dce7d14dd1c7e6462016409f; 5b2c4084eea63062d1d81f203c3a3c0849ad2cdb; 91f5ded1564bfa2ee677699a662d9c43d6de7516; 5fb85a983a220c68325cd452833ccb7500f0a375; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; eda9bde1c6c8517cd64ffebacdadd1c0b5889d69; fbc993e50927db7d9afa328ad6545be5d97a7ca5; 635b811fed36d98dafad025175947e2700dfdbfc; 78bc77a8b1fdc27ac4852cd037c8b35c27514336; b68111d2e692bbc1e5708b9d0de346e9e12577d4; af6238a1c6ae858337bb382bdf9dacffd383fc50; 2f29f896deac1d8190f9474ac268b42eca010804; ae3f31c841c460b15a81bf51655f4c0e39cacc79; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 5df344fbb19b98f2375ef94543c26beb4b8fdc4e,Journal of The Royal Statistical Society Series B-statistical Methodology,81,385-408
f184f0277a9c4a2f66f94614b396481ab60aa06d,Systematic correlation of environmental exposure and physiological and self-reported behaviour factors with leukocyte telomere length,"Background
It is hypothesized that environmental exposures and behaviour influence telomere length, an indicator of cellular ageing. We systematically associated 461 indicators of environmental exposures, physiology and self-reported behaviour with telomere length in data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999-2002. Further, we tested whether factors identified in the NHANES participants are also correlated with gene expression of telomere length modifying genes.


Methods
We correlated 461 environmental exposures, behaviours and clinical variables with telomere length, using survey-weighted linear regression, adjusting for sex, age, age squared, race/ethnicity, poverty level, education and born outside the USA, and estimated the false discovery rate to adjust for multiple hypotheses. We conducted a secondary analysis to investigate the correlation between identified environmental variables and gene expression levels of telomere-associated genes in publicly available gene expression samples.


Results
After correlating 461 variables with telomere length, we found 22 variables significantly associated with telomere length after adjustment for multiple hypotheses. Of these varaibales, 14 were associated with longer telomeres, including biomarkers of polychlorinated biphenyls([PCBs; 0.1 to 0.2 standard deviation (SD) increase for 1 SD increase in PCB level, P â€‰<â€‰0.002] and a form of vitamin A, retinyl stearate. Eight variables associated with shorter telomeres, including biomarkers of cadmium, C-reactive protein and lack of physical activity. We could not conclude that PCBs are correlated with gene expression of telomere-associated genes.


Conclusions
Both environmental exposures and chronic disease-related risk factors may play a role in telomere length. Our secondary analysis found no evidence of association between PCBs/smoking and gene expression of telomere-associated genes.

Czech J. Anim. Sci., 63, 136â€“143. The aim of this study was to analyse the genomic regions that have been target of natural selection with respect to identifying the loci responsible mainly for fitness traits across six alpine cattle breeds. The genome-wide scan for selection signatures was performed using genotyping data from totally 465 animals. After applying data quality control, overall 35 873 single nucleotide polymorphisms were useable for the subsequent analysis. The detection of genomic regions affected by natural selection was carried out using the approach of principal component analysis. The analysis was based on the assumption that markers extremely related to the population structure are also candidates for local adaptation potential of the population. Based on the expected false discovery rate equal to 10% up to 1138 loci were identified as outliers. The strongest signals of selection were found in genomic regions on BTA 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 13, and 22. Most genes located in the identified regions have been previously associated with immunity system as well as body growth and muscle formation that mainly reflect the pressure of both natural and artificial selection in respect to adaptation of analysed breeds to the local environmental conditions. The results also signalized that those regions represent a correlated selection response in way to maintain the fitness of analysed breeds.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Nina MoravÄ\215Ã­kovÃ¡"", ids = ""8857616""); list(name = ""Mojca SimÄ\215iÄ\215"", ids = ""34876926""); list(name = ""GÃ¡bor MÃ©szÃ¡ros"", ids = ""35144579""); list(name = ""Johann SÃ¶lkner"", ids = ""2785832""); list(name = ""Veronika KukuÄ\215kovÃ¡"", ids = ""8841298""); list(name = ""Michal VlÄ\215ek"", ids = ""89331836""); list(name = ""Anna TrakovickÃ¡"", ids = ""5017933""); list(name = ""Ondrej KadleÄ\215Ã­k"", ids = ""8840706""); list(name = ""Radovan Kasarda"", ids = ""8845807"")",569bf2a80da17d5a164715f7d19df123f6a8af1d,6f4d891e90e1aa645c6b6d40e95b8dfd4db4eeec; e600aa8fd0bda66613f936d6c9aa4d994046fe25; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 8997e761d26bd8779b4a57dd3b4f5d3b6a65a7a6; 32a4d9076338ce3b3ba0978a3438da37a2136e6f; 3cf8718ae3fb10d7b15cb9c2df32bd880a8e1b53; 9f0f5ea38977e81e44cb0ac76c6cc1f3afa7b7aa; ccda06296a8dfef21ff13bd6a78e1f38a91aec54; fa5015b38fb1530bcd9553a8675c4ca8210210e8; 6c9a42477fabe7c906b3b7a63946887560888d57; 1f5a400fb88f81e012fffac965f7918fa717df8f; 77f4dbc9a43343c1216cf34f45f76140667da2b0; 44347053d7a3365405fc52b495865f7c7072a755; 6595a4c376af3f4c65a640c133cb5b9d9d3141f3; 78bcb05df8140a4045c31d813370423f62d3c15e; 84ed2e35e58dd9b6e9b808cd8ab5657ec68f6ac8; cac8c90da75c9d383f5b97bb60f75f6abe2177e5; a1bc87977a78a3d0c8807ccd8ede718eb160e5be; 006dc12f32152ed8438c926504845c3c969509e1; 1e4291546460a9dd60ba087300a105cce3a83b1d; 6b6f05cd7001f06e25ba7c460e586d5edbe6043c; 663eb2a9484090fe16117506b321a15556dac286; 0b42d61e6995c3b1ea9eb74447d3583142356b10; 84903490ed17b97974852af39225c3288ac632b4; 768c4f6fe67b77b1ab6c9ac115a271aa26e936d1; a1ef13a8f28f1cf2569a7fc5d07f4a6a7ddb894a; 3b375bb2ba135910f540f441aa1242cb63fe731f; 65625b6b22192fbef42d698bfccc2488ab46994a; 2680fbdbe4ca48a881b1526bf9e460e8c6e87889; 0f1f41e4a55eb7456800944b769bcfff11e4147a,Czech Journal of Animal Science,63,136-143
07cf9752417c8ba856ecbb4f6cc5bd8833200dff,"Identification of important regressor groups, subgroups and individuals via regularization methods: application to gut microbiome data","MOTIVATION
Gut microbiota can be classified at multiple taxonomy levels. Strategies to use changes in microbiota composition to effect health improvements require knowing at which taxonomy level interventions should be aimed. Identifying these important levels is difficult, however, because most statistical methods only consider when the microbiota are classified at one taxonomy level, not multiple.


RESULTS
Using L1 and L2 regularizations, we developed a new variable selection method that identifies important features at multiple taxonomy levels. The regularization parameters are chosen by a new, data-adaptive, repeated cross-validation approach, which performed well. In simulation studies, our method outperformed competing methods: it more often selected significant variables, and had small false discovery rates and acceptable false-positive rates. Applying our method to gut microbiota data, we found which taxonomic levels were most altered by specific interventions or physiological status.


AVAILABILITY
The new approach is implemented in an R package, which is freely available from the corresponding author.

288beb0fec0c463bf1e8592b97275dd1530a7623,A cry in the dark: depressed mothers show reduced neural activation to their own infant's cry.,"This study investigated depression-related differences in primiparous mothers' neural response to their own infant's distress cues. Mothers diagnosed with major depressive disorder (nâ€‰=â€‰11) and comparison mothers with no diagnosable psychopathology (nâ€‰=â€‰11) were exposed to their own 18-months-old infant's cry sound, as well as unfamiliar infant's cry and control sound, during functional neuroimaging. Depressed mothers' response to own infant cry greater than other sounds was compared to non-depressed mothers' response in the whole brain [false discovery rate (FDR) corrected]. A continuous measure of self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD) was also tested as a predictor of maternal response. Non-depressed mothers activated to their own infant's cry greater than control sound in a distributed network of para/limbic and prefrontal regions, whereas depressed mothers as a group failed to show activation. Non-depressed compared to depressed mothers showed significantly greater striatal (caudate, nucleus accumbens) and medial thalamic activation. Additionally, mothers with lower depressive symptoms activated more strongly in left orbitofrontal, dorsal anterior cingulate and medial superior frontal regions. Non-depressed compared to depressed mothers activated uniquely to own infant greater than other infant cry in occipital fusiform areas. Disturbance of these neural networks involved in emotional response and regulation may help to explain parenting deficits in depressed mothers.",2012,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Heidemarie Kaiser Laurent"", ids = ""34850487""); list(name = ""Jennifer C.

a3bc1cba706b5ad0b58cddb3cfbfc45e15b26736,Investigation of oxygen targets and hypoxic adaptation in paediatric critical illness,"Background: The effect of varying oxygen tension on the outcome of critically ill patients is contentious. Many interventions employed in the intensive care unit aimed at increasing oxygen delivery can cause harm. During the natural history of critical illness, adaption to tissue hypoxia may occur to a greater or lesser extent. I used the principle of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) with a vascular occlusion test to investigate forearm muscle oxygen consumption. / Methods: The relationship between arterial oxygenation and mortality in critically ill children was explored with a retrospective observational study, a national survey and a systematic review in chapter 3. Chapter 4 describes a study of Near infrared spectroscopy with a vascular occlusion test (NIRS VOT) in children with suspected mitochondrial disease. The aim was ascertain if NIRS VOT as a technique is able to reflect tissue oxygen consumption. Chapter 5 covers the Young Everest Study 2. Healthy volunteers (8-16 years) who travelled to Nepal and trekked to 3525 meters altitude were tested at two altitudes (sea level and 3525 meters). The aim was to investigate the physiological response to a hypobaric hypoxic environment including the NIRS VOT. Chapter 6 covers studies conducted on critically ill children admitted to the PICU in GOSH. These include serial NIRS VOT study, an in-vivo measure of oxygen consumption of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes changes in the first 48 hours after admission to the PICU in children with meningococcal septic shock. / Results: Chapter 3: The epidemiological study of the children admitted to the intensive care unit showed that 40 children had a P aO2 of less than 20 mmHg (2.6 kPa) out of a total 7751 admissions in a 9 year period. Of these, 33 children survived to hospital discharge. There was a U shaped relationship between arterial oxygen tension and mortality. The results from the survey showed a varied practice. Of the total, 21 respondents (42%, 95%CI : 29.3 55.7%) stated that they do not follow specific P aO2 targets. Of the rest, as equal number (21, 42%) aimed for targets between 8.1 (61 mmHg) and 10 kPa (76 mmHg). Only 8(16%) aimed for what would be considered a normal range (10.1 13kP a). A majority of the units (96%) reported having an alarm target on their oxygen saturation monitor. However, 73% of the respondents worked in units that did not have an oxygen weaning protocol for mechanically ventilated patients. In acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrest and sepsis, there was a tendency to aim for lower P aO2 ( 0.4). The systematic review identified 11 studies (n=5280) related to hypoxia with combined odds ratio (OR) for death of 3.13 (95%CI: 1.79-5.48, p <0.001) compared to normoxia. Six studies (n=2012) investigated the effect of hyperoxia and suggest no eâ†µect on mortality compared to normoxia: OR 1.15 (95%CI: 0.42-3.17, p = 0.77). / Chapter 4: A DropTOI value of 14 was noted to have the least crossover between the mitochondrial disease group and controls. This was empirically set as the cutoff for the 2x2 table. The Fisher exact test statistic was 0.22 and showed that NIRS VOT is unable to differentiate between mitochondrial disease and controls. The NIRS VOT was able to exclude mitochondrial disease in healthy children with a high degree of certainty (positive LR - 5.66, 95%CI:0.84-38, negative LR - 0.61, 95%CI:0.47-0.80). / Chapter 5: The SpO2 at rest decreased from 99Â±0.79 to 89Â±2.54 % from London to Namche (p=0.0009). The SpO2 after exercise decreased from 93.5 Â± 7.16 to 83.3 Â± 5.06 % from London to Namche (p=0.008). The heart rate Z-scores at rest changed from 0.44Â±0.70 to 0.10Â±0.76 bpm (p=0.30) whilst the heart rate Z-scores after exercise increased from 1.20 Â± 1.30 to 2.07 Â± 1.46. Cardiac index (at rest) did not show a statistically significant change with an ascent to moderate altitude. Respiratory rate after exercise increased consistently from sea level (22.2 Â± 4.4) to Namche Bazaar (27.6 Â± 10.9). With a multilevel functional regression analysis, the baseline TOI was significantly lower in Namche Bazaar than London (-4.05, 95%CI: -3.23, -4.86, p <0.001). The lowest TOI was also significantly lower in Namche Bazaar (-1.95, 95%CI: -1.13, -2.76, p <0.001). The DropTOI at Namche bazaar compared to sea level was 2.1 points lower (p <0.0001). / Chapter 6: Tissue Oxygen Index varied during the first 5 days of illness. The DropTOI decreased until day 4 (3.02 lower) and showed relative increase on day 5 (0.93 lower) compared to day 1. The net routine control ratio (measured with oroboros analyser) dropped from day 1 to day 5. On the group level analysis (all five patients assessed together), with a false discovery rate (FDR) at <25% and ranked according to their Normalised Enrichment Score (NES), 1039 out of 3655 gene sets showed a decreasing profile with time. The respiratory electron transport chain gene set was ranked 75th of the 1039 gene sets. / Conclusions: The oxygen administration practices in the paediatric intensive care units in the UK vary widely. Of note, admission PaO2 has a â€˜U-shapedâ€™ relationship to mortality in children admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit. Healthy children, when exposed to hypobaric hypoxic conditions, show a tendency to decrease oxygen consumption from forearm muscle. There was some evidence that critically ill children demonstrate similar signs of early adaptive response by reducing oxygen consumption.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sim Raman"", ids = ""153517959"")",,,,,
f3b82538847aac82d2dc4e5f14a1c9d9ca62dd81,Peak Detection in Mass Spectrometry by Gabor Filters and Envelope Analysis,"Mass Spectrometry (MS) is increasingly being used to discover diseases-related proteomic patterns. The peak detection step is one of the most important steps in the typical analysis of MS data. Recently, many new algorithms have been proposed to increase true position rate with low false discovery rate in peak detection. Most of them follow two approaches: one is the denoising approach and the other is the decomposing approach. In the previous studies, the decomposition of MS data method shows more potential than the first one. In this paper, we propose two novel methods, named GaborLocal and GaborEnvelop, both of which can detect more true peaks with a lower false discovery rate than previous methods. We employ the method of Gaussian local maxima to detect peaks, because it is robust to noise in signals. A new approach, peak rank, is defined for the first time to identify peaks instead of using the signal-to-noise ratio. Meanwhile, the Gabor filter is used to amplify important information and compress noise in the raw MS signal. Moreover, we also propose the envelope analysis to improve the quantification of peaks and remove more false peaks. The proposed methods have been performed on the real SELDI-TOF spectrum with known polypeptide positions. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods outperform other commonly used methods in the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.",2009,Computer Science; Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nha Nguyen"", ids = ""145113610""); list(name = ""Heng Huang"", ids = ""1748032""); list(name = ""Soontorn Oraintara"", ids = ""1725406""); list(name = ""An P.

d2469a25601aaa025c1b6e07f464fcc844aaf7bd,Gray matter volume changes in chronic subcortical stroke: A cross-sectional study,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of lesion side and degree of motor recovery on gray matter volume (GMV) difference relative to healthy controls in right-handed subcortical stroke. Structural MRI data were collected in 97 patients with chronic subcortical ischemic stroke and 79 healthy controls. Voxel-wise GMV analysis was used to investigate the effects of lesion side and degree of motor recovery on GMV difference in right-handed chronic subcortical stroke patients. Compared with healthy controls, right-lesion patients demonstrated GMV increase (PÂ <Â 0.05, voxel-wise false discovery rate correction) in the bilateral paracentral lobule (PCL) and supplementary motor area (SMA) and the right middle occipital gyrus (MOG); while left-lesion patients did not exhibit GMV difference under the same threshold. Patients with complete and partial motor recovery showed similar degree of GMV increase in right-lesion patients.

Background: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are cystic pancreatic cancer (PC) precursors that are increasingly being detected incidentally by cross-sectional imaging. IPMNs harbor potential for invasive malignancy depending on the degree of histologic dysplasia which ranges from low to high grade, yet the only way to determine disease severity is through surgical resection and histopathologic investigation. Mi(cro)RNAs, non-coding RNAs that regulate one-third of protein coding genes, are attractive candidate biomarkers of early pancreatic malignancy because they are detectable in tissue and blood in a stable form, making them amenable to reliable measurement, and they have been implicated in the development and progression of PC. The goal of our pilot project was to discover and characterize a miRNA signature that accurately differentiates between low-grade IPMNs that merit continued surveillance and high-grade IPMNs that warrant immediate surgical resection. Methods: In our discovery phase, we microdissected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) and isolated total RNA from 28 pathologically-confirmed IPMNs (9 low-grade and 19 high-grade) surgically resected at our institution between 1999 and 2011, and evaluated the expression of 378 mature miRNAs using high-throughput Taqman Low Density Arrays. After normalization using the endogenous control RNU44, a rank-sum test was performed to compare the expression between the two groups for each miRNA. Results: Using a false discovery rate of 10%, there were 13 differentially expressed miRNAs with statistical significance. The top candidates include miR-100 (P=1.6 x10âˆ’3), miR-99b and miR-99a (P=2.7 x10âˆ’3), miR-342-3p and miR-126 (P = 3.7 x10âˆ’3), and miR-130a (P = 3.7 x10âˆ’3). Several of these miRNAs were highlighted in a recent investigation of FFPE tissue and cyst fluid from patients with IPMNs and other pancreatic cysts, demonstrating consistency of findings. Furthermore, the expression level of the top candidate miRNAs was down-regulated in high-grade compared to low-grade IPMN tissue, in line with recent data supporting a role for these miRNAs as tumor suppressors and regulators of key genes that contribute to cell proliferation and invasion in pancreatic and other malignancies. Analysis is underway to evaluate the expression of the top candidate miRNAs in an independent set of high- and low-grade IPMN tissue specimens, and to correlate miRNA expression with other possible clinical predictors of malignant potential. Conclusions: Although preliminary, our findings suggest that miRNAs may serve as a diagnostic adjunct for stratifying patients with IPMNs for continued surveillance or surgical resection.

In this setting, robust methods ensure that the analysis is not significantly disturbed by any outlying observation. However, knowledge of these observations may be important to assess the underlying mechanisms of the data. Therefore, a robust outlier test is discussed, together with an adequate false discovery rate correction measure, to be used in the context of multiple linear regression with categorical explanatory variables. The methodology focuses on genetic association studies of quantitative traits, though it has much broader applications. The method is also compared to a benchmark rule from the literature and its good performance is validated by a simulation study and a real data example from a candidate gene study.",2014,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Vanda M.

dd8a7779f7ecec287d536aa35a58dcce87ccecf2,MotifMap: integrative genome-wide maps of regulatory motif sites for model species,"BackgroundA central challenge of biology is to map and understand gene regulation on a genome-wide scale. For any given genome, only a small fraction of the regulatory elements embedded in the DNA sequence have been characterized, and there is great interest in developing computational methods to systematically map all these elements and understand their relationships. Such computational efforts, however, are significantly hindered by the overwhelming size of non-coding regions and the statistical variability and complex spatial organizations of regulatory elements and interactions. Genome-wide catalogs of regulatory elements for all model species simply do not yet exist.ResultsThe MotifMap system uses databases of transcription factor binding motifs, refined genome alignments, and a comparative genomic statistical approach to provide comprehensive maps of candidate regulatory elements encoded in the genomes of model species. The system is used to derive new genome-wide maps for yeast, fly, worm, mouse, and human. The human map contains 519,108 sites for 570 matrices with a False Discovery Rate of 0.1 or less. The new maps are assessed in several ways, for instance using high-throughput experimental ChIP-seq data and AUC statistics, providing strong evidence for their accuracy and coverage. The maps can be usefully integrated with many other kinds of omic data and are available at http://motifmap.igb.uci.edu/.ConclusionsMotifMap and its integration with other data provide a foundation for analyzing gene regulation on a genome-wide scale, and for automatically generating regulatory pathways and hypotheses. The power of this approach is demonstrated and discussed using the P53 apoptotic pathway and the Gli hedgehog pathways as examples.",2011,Medicine; Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Kenneth Daily"", ids = ""31968103""); list(name = ""Vishal R.

The results of the contest highlight that, because of the extensive efforts made towards the construction of databases and search tools, database-assisted small molecule identification can now automatically annotate some metabolite signals found in the metabolome data. In this commentary, the current state of metabolite annotation is compared with that of transcriptomics and proteomics. The comparison suggested that certain limitations in the metabolite annotation process need to be addressed, such as (i) the completeness of the database, (ii) the conversion between raw data and structure, (iii) the one-to-one correspondence between measured data and correct search results, and (iv) the false discovery rate in database search results.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Fumio Matsuda"", ids = ""145339256"")",6d707d329a197722957aafedfdcd11218e775b4f; 3508019e640385176ce304bfac2d7aaccd919d80; 19f8789399e2982dea3b76d645a3d26485911e08; 6c9b56ee0f23f608f2fcc268f32a64806dcf7ee3; e2b459e16013e572c33461b3bc74da05fe357d4c; b8b5e04e895c6af0c4776bd7a823bf0edb0b7356; bca6cda574c10c67cd2af5ba6e119fefb6f12f55,,Mass spectrometry,3 Spec Iss 2,"

e315b88587b2769d3f7df5c4dacb19ece3c05948,Hypothesis Testing in High-Dimensional Instrumental Variables Regression with an Application to Genomics Data,"Gene expression and phenotype association can be affected by potential unmeasured confounders from multiple sources, leading to biased estimates of the associations. Since genetic variants largely explain gene expression variations, they can be used as instruments in studying the association between gene expressions and phenotype in the framework of high dimensional instrumental variable (IV) regression. However, because the dimensions of both genetic variants and gene expressions are often larger than the sample size, statistical inferences such as hypothesis testing for such high dimensional IV models are not trivial and have not been investigated in literature. The problem is more challenging since the instrumental variables (e.g., genetic variants) have to be selected among a large set of genetic variants. This paper considers the problem of hypothesis testing for sparse IV regression models and presents methods for testing single regression coefficient and multiple testing of multiple coefficients, where the test statistic for each single coefficient is constructed based on an inverse regression. A multiple testing procedure is developed for selecting variables and is shown to control the false discovery rate. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed methods. These methods are illustrated by an analysis of a yeast dataset in order to identify genes that are associated with growth in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jiarui Lu"", ids = ""119590074""); list(name = ""Hongzhe Li"", ids = ""2814908"")",,ef1bf316ce572888268aba556d8534768e8c816a; da5a54e9e15ddb2f4c854e4f32487da9e81c20d1; 46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; 9af732a0026ca1db41d8d79485874e7e8c97be61; 83fbcc08d00e60201a715f7aa9d068f218961b56; 6de127ccd38e366716d9059903634f61cb62d86e; fb156076888c08cc57c4796009a8e5567a29ea88; ebd3379c1f1b245b3f4b04a03881fbc2c4e504f8; dc791b8176fee4f218a960990c54946696d6f35d; 7cd1619370c1ab9b68acbb05d91b6562c78ed8a8; ad1a89b30525c33140757dede07c02b257e055ba; 70f65a84041ff7bb65e0b22bffc7da7e84f766ca; b1f709a743b1ae913803c42c5ceb718077e2479d; 453ad9b414c1b35492e7b5b455cfca5684556e9c; bfc871e0e727433cb9ad5c90bccc9291ae246f61; 9a79a05961cf42906d920478ac9513b684da4c04; bb92178d5133f9165b704500cbe2e5a1b2dab01d; bc6d1cb0a6e0033e880ad892c5fa5ce285a44db1; 3fca66788025992221e737d70b08829d06acde39; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 67f33b4ea84c8cf815a9919dd34fee6e85c22f6f; 3b81308ebc5132ba4c002e3d509deafb90a155b3; e5957a8cfd753aa3c9b2de4f870f165fbf4e1463; e0476be2c353a1c1a6f747f160f08b3b7dda7574; 10701988fecf6f2073543d584481f0380ed8913e; 315d1eed34cc519b51904b19f899145d220736b8,arXiv: Methodology,,
e1ffbf17db21caddf286c9740d301679787d055b,Abstract LB-160: Genetic variations in the AGEs/AGER pathway and risk of pancreatic cancer,"Background: Chronic inflammation is implicated in pancreatic cancer carcinogenesis. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which are rich in cooked red meat and cigarette smoke, can perpetuate inflammation by binding to the receptor for advanced glycation end products (AGER, also known as RAGE). We hypothesized that genetic variation of the AGEs/AGER pathway affects pancreatic cancer risk by modulating chronic inflammation. Methods: We conducted a two-stage case-control study to examine the association between 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 21 genes (GLO1, MSR1, PINK1, KIF17, AGPAT1, AKR1B1, DDOST, CD36, SCARB1, AGER, APP, HMGB1, S100A8, S100B, S100P, S100A12, MMP9, ADAM10, PPARG, NOTCH4, and PDGF) of the AGEs/AGER pathway and risk of pancreatic cancer. The discovery study was conducted in 672 pancreatic cancer cases and 1361 controls ascertained from the Womenâ€™s Health Initiative (WHI) Study matched on age, race/ethnicity and study arm. The validation study was conducted in a PANC4 pooled hospital-based case-control study of 1,034 women cases and 989 women controls. A pooled analysis of 1706 cases and 2350 controls was also performed. SNP data were obtained or imputed from the previously performed GWASs. Pancreatic cancer risk was calculated as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cis) using logistic regression models adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes, and smoking using an additive genetic model. The potential interaction between individual SNP and red meat intake and cigarette smoking was examined. A false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted q value Results: We identified 11 SNPs with raw P values Summary and Conclusion: We did not observe significant association between any of 96 single SNP and pancreatic cancer risk. However, we found combined set of SNPs in the GLO1, DDOST, and CD36 genes were associated with risk of pancreatic cancer. GLO SNP rs6932648 may modify the association between smoking and risk of pancreatic cancer. GLO1, DDOST, and CD36 are involved in detoxification or clearance of AGEs compounds. Further investigation of AGEs and receptors systems in pancreatic cancer is warranted.

c158f70986263bf050ee787cddaec365b7feafcf,Postprandial alterations in whole-blood DNA methylation are mediated by changes in white blood cell composition.,"BACKGROUND
DNA methylation is an essential nuclear process associated with genomic functions such as transcription factor binding and the regulation of gene expression. DNA methylation patterns can also serve as potential biomarkers for disease progression and response to therapy. However, the full dynamics of DNA methylation across daily physiologic events have not been fully elucidated.


OBJECTIVE
We sought to study how ingesting a standardized meal acutely affects peripheral blood DNA methylation.


DESIGN
We performed an observational study in healthy men (n = 26) on DNA methylation and gene expression in whole blood before and 160 min after the ingestion of a standardized meal. Cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) methylation was assayed on the HumanMethylation450k microarray, and gene expression was measured with the Human Gene 2.1 ST Array.


RESULTS
Differential methylation after food intake was detected in 13% of the analyzed probes (63,207 CpG probes) at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). This effect was driven by changes in leukocyte fractions as estimated from comparisons against methylation datasets generated from sorted leukocytes. When methylation values were adjusted for estimated leukocyte fractions, 541 probes were observed to be altered in the postprandial state (5% FDR).


CONCLUSIONS
Apparent alterations in DNA methylation 160 min after meal ingestion mainly reflect changes in the estimated leukocyte population in whole blood. These results have major methodologic implications for genome-wide methylation studies because they highlight the strong underlying effects of changes in leukocyte fractions on CpG methylation patterns as well as the potential importance of meal-standardized sampling procedures for future investigations when alterations in white blood cell fractions are unavailable.

d2c67dc363841f980161e08e8b1b681a90e926f1,3DeFDR: Identifying cell type-specific looping interactions with empirical false discovery rate guided thresholding,"The mammalian genome is connected into tens of thousands of long-range looping interactions critically linked to spatiotemporal gene expression regulation. An important unanswered question is to what extent looping interactions change across developmental models, genetic perturbations, drug treatments, and disease states. Although methods exist for calling loops in single biological conditions, there is a severe shortage of computational tools for rigorous assessment of cell type-specific looping interactions across multiple biological conditions. Here we present 3DeFDR, a simple and effective statistical tool for classifying dynamic looping interactions across biological conditions from Chromosome-Conformation-Capture-Carbon-Copy (5C) data. 3DeFDR parses chromatin contacts into invariant and cell type-specific classes by thresholding on differences in modeled interaction strength signal across two or three cellular states. Thresholds are iteratively adjusted based on a target empirical false discovery rate computed between real and simulated 5C maps. 3DeFDR enables the sensitive detection of high-confidence looping interactions and markedly reduces false positives when benchmarked against a classic analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, our newly formulated parametric likelihood ratio test (3DLRT), and the leading Hi-C differential interaction caller diffHic. 3DeFDR also sensitively and specifically calls loops in Mb-scale genomic regions parsed from Hi-C data. Our work provides a statistical framework and an open-source coding library for identifying dynamic long-range looping interactions in high-resolution 5C data from multiple cellular conditions.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Lindsey R.

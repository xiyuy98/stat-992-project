Important is that the most frequent ganglioglioma (GG) and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) showed limited number of detectable molecular alterations. In such cases analyses of additional genomic mechanisms seem to be the most promising. The aim of the study was to evaluate microRNA (miRNA) profiles in GGs, DNETs and pilocytic asytrocytomas (PA) and test the hypothesis of plausible miRNA connection with histopathological subtypes of particular pediatric glial and mixed glioneronal tumors.MethodsThe study was designed as the two-stage analysis. Microarray testing was performed with the use of the miRCURY LNA microRNA Array technology in 51 cases. Validation set comprised 107 samples used during confirmation of the profiling results by qPCR bioinformatic analysis.ResultsMicroarray data was compared between the groups using an analysis of variance with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure used to estimate false discovery rates. After filtration 782 miRNAs were eligible for further analysis. Based on the results of 10â€‰Ã—â€‰10-fold cross-validation J48 algorithm was identified as the most resilient to overfitting. Pairwise comparison showed the DNETs to be the most divergent with the largest number of miRNAs differing from either of the two comparative groups. Validation of array analysis was performed for miRNAs used in the classification model: miR-155-5p, miR-4754, miR-4530, miR-628-3p, let-7b-3p, miR-4758-3p, miRPlus-A1086 and miR-891a-5p. Model developed on their expression measured by qPCR showed weighted AUC of 0.97 (95% CI for all classes ranging from 0.91 to 1.00). A computational analysis was used to identify mRNA targets for final set of selected miRNAs using miRWalk database. Among genomic targets of selected molecules ZBTB20, LCOR, PFKFB2, SYNJ2BP and TPD52 genes were noted.ConclusionsOur data showed the existence of miRNAs which expression is specific for different histological types of tumors. miRNA expression analysis may be useful in in-depth molecular diagnostic process of the tumors and could elucidate their origins and molecular background.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Magdalena Zakrzewska"", ids = ""33971042""); list(name = ""Renata Gruszka"", ids = ""39425716""); list(name = ""Konrad Stawiski"", ids = ""2841770""); list(name = ""Wojciech Fendler"", ids = ""3030426""); list(name = ""Joanna Kordacka"", ids = ""134177349""); list(name = ""WiesÅ‚awa Grajkowska"", ids = ""5639718""); list(name = ""PaweÅ‚ Daszkiewicz"", ids = ""36466646""); list(name = ""Pawel P.

76aaa591b3b68deb69eab10148ef54733fcc4c4f,New insights into old methods for identifying causal rare variants,"The advance of high-throughput next-generation sequencing technology makes possible the analysis of rare variants. However, the investigation of rare variants in unrelated-individuals data sets faces the challenge of low power, and most methods circumvent the difficulty by using various collapsing procedures based on genes, pathways, or gene clusters. We suggest a new way to identify causal rare variants using the F-statistic and sliced inverse regression. The procedure is tested on the data set provided by the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 (GAW17). After preliminary data reduction, we ranked markers according to their F-statistic values. Top-ranked markers were then subjected to sliced inverse regression, and those with higher absolute coefficients in the most significant sliced inverse regression direction were selected. The procedure yields good false discovery rates for the GAW17 data and thus is a promising method for future study on rare variants.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Haitian Wang"", ids = ""48016062""); list(name = ""Chien-Hsun Huang"", ids = ""150058063""); list(name = ""Shaw-Hwa Lo"", ids = ""145485463""); list(name = ""Tian Zheng"", ids = ""145857622""); list(name = ""Inchi Hu"", ids = ""1710209"")",76aaa591b3b68deb69eab10148ef54733fcc4c4f,2fcb901f46c42bc28e1514e023b7d9e5379cd2dc; d60d384a4b7dfa14b5ae5e1190a73d155888a4fd; 76aaa591b3b68deb69eab10148ef54733fcc4c4f; 198163e30ca65cd176b3fbfc916b3e22ce2dff62; 3772d06c12a57584eddb3eb55ce8b0cfbc05a1d0; a487c664b21fd199054b7821f651ff63c8c1195b,BMC Proceedings,5,S50 - S50
109373bc3dafd277a0bffb4876c9de8995807fc0,Genetic variants in eleven telomere-associated genes and the risk of incident cardio/cerebrovascular disease: The Women's Genome Health Study.,"BACKGROUND
Candidate genes associated with telomere length maintenance, an important molecular marker for biological aging, represent potential risk predictors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). To date, no prospective data are available.


METHODS
The associations between 154 tag-single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of 11 telomere-associated candidate genes (TERT, POT1, TNKS, TERF1, TNKS2, UCP2, TEP1, ACD, TERF2, TERF2IP, and TERC) were investigated in 23,294 Caucasian participants of the Women's Genome Health Study. All were free of known CVD and cancer at baseline. The primary outcome measure was a composite CVD end point (incident ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), or death due to ischemic CVD); other measures were incident MI and ischemic stroke. During follow-up, 1178 total incident CVD, 315 incident MI cases, and 323 incident ischemic stroke events were identified. Multivariable Cox regression analysis and a haplotype-based approach were performed to investigate the relationship between genotypes/haplotypes and CVD risk, assuming an additive model.


RESULTS
In a marker-by-marker analysis, 7 (TEP1, TNKS, and ACD), 11 (TEP1, ACD, and TERT), and 24 (TEP1, TNKS, TERT, TERF2IP, TNKS2, and UCP2) SNPs were associated-at the level of p < 0.05-with the total CVD, MI, and ischemic stroke risk, respectively. Further analysis using a haplotype-based approach showed similar findings. Although none remained significant after the correction of multiple testing, the false discovery rate analysis revealed 28% of the nominally significant SNPs with true associations in relation to ischemic stroke risk.


CONCLUSIONS
The present large prospective study encourages further investigation of the biological role of telomere-associated pathway genes in the pathogenesis and early assessment of vascular events.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Robert Y L Zee"", ids = ""3299049""); list(name = ""Paul M.

c4ed4625b47a22bae7fea6ab1150c46468489c5e,Genomic profiling of the human heart before and after mechanical support with a ventricular assist device reveals alterations in vascular signaling networks.,"Mechanical unloading of the heart with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) significantly decreases mortality in patients with heart failure. Moreover, it provides a human model to define the critical regulatory genes governing myocardial remodeling in response to significant reductions in wall stress. Statistical analysis of a gene expression library of 19 paired human heart samples harvested at the time of LVAD implant and again at explant revealed a set of 22 genes that were downregulated and 85 genes that were upregulated in response to mechanical unloading with a false discovery rate of less than 1%. The analysis revealed a high percentage of genes involved in the regulation of vascular networks including neuropilin-1 (a VEGF receptor), FGF9, Sprouty1, stromal-derived factor 1, and endomucin. Taken together these findings suggest that mechanical unloading alters the regulation of vascular organization and migration in the heart. In addition to vascular signaling networks, GATA-4 binding protein, a critical mediator of myocyte hypertrophy, was significantly downregulated following mechanical unloading. In summary, these findings may have important implications for defining the role of mechanical stretch and load on autocrine/paracrine signals directing vascular organization in the failing human heart and the role of GATA-4 in orchestrating reverse myocardial remodeling. This unbiased gene discovery approach in paired human heart samples has the potential to provide critical clues to the next generation of therapeutic treatments aimed at heart failure.",2004,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jennifer L.

57e48b302126110bef2191232eaacc11262dc58f,Defining the regulatory network of the tissue-specific splicing factors Fox-1 and Fox-2.,"The precise regulation of many alternative splicing (AS) events by specific splicing factors is essential to determine tissue types and developmental stages. However, the molecular basis of tissue-specific AS regulation and the properties of splicing regulatory networks (SRNs) are poorly understood. Here we comprehensively predict the targets of the brain- and muscle-specific splicing factor Fox-1 (A2BP1) and its paralog Fox-2 (RBM9) and systematically define the corresponding SRNs genome-wide. Fox-1/2 are conserved from worm to human, and specifically recognize the RNA element UGCAUG. We integrate Fox-1/2-binding specificity with phylogenetic conservation, splicing microarray data, and additional computational and experimental characterization. We predict thousands of Fox-1/2 targets with conserved binding sites, at a false discovery rate (FDR) of approximately 24%, including many validated experimentally, suggesting a surprisingly extensive SRN. The preferred position of the binding sites differs according to AS pattern, and determines either activation or repression of exon recognition by Fox-1/2. Many predicted targets are important for neuromuscular functions, and have been implicated in several genetic diseases. We also identified instances of binding site creation or loss in different vertebrate lineages and human populations, which likely reflect fine-tuning of gene expression regulation during evolution.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Chaolin Zhang"", ids = ""1796987""); list(name = ""Zuo Zhang"", ids = ""50316934""); list(name = ""John Castle"", ids = ""145930945""); list(name = ""Shuying Sun"", ids = ""48904556""); list(name = ""Jason S.

f179c2d4ac16a380726aa7de6dbc6ad946bc9165,Insulin immuno-neutralization in fed chickens: effects on liver and muscle transcriptome.,"Chickens mimic an insulin-resistance state by exhibiting several peculiarities with regard to plasma glucose level and its control by insulin. To gain insight into the role of insulin in the control of chicken transcriptome, liver and leg muscle transcriptomes were compared in fed controls and ""diabetic"" chickens, at 5 h after insulin immuno-neutralization, using 20.7K-chicken oligo-microarrays. At a level of false discovery rate <0.01, 1,573 and 1,225 signals were significantly modified by insulin privation in liver and muscle, respectively. Microarray data agreed reasonably well with qRT-PCR and some protein level measurements. Differentially expressed mRNAs with human ID were classified using Biorag analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Multiple metabolic pathways, structural proteins, transporters and proteins of intracellular trafficking, major signaling pathways, and elements of the transcriptional control machinery were largely represented in both tissues. At least 42 mRNAs have already been associated with diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity, energy expenditure, or identified as sensors of metabolism in mice or humans. The contribution of the pathways presently identified to chicken physiology (particularly those not yet related to insulin) needs to be evaluated in future studies. Other challenges include the characterization of ""unknown"" mRNAs and the identification of the steps or networks, which disturbed tissue transcriptome so extensively, quickly after the turning off of the insulin signal. In conclusion, pleiotropic effects of insulin in chickens are further evidenced; major pathways controlled by insulin in mammals have been conserved despite the presence of unique features of insulin signaling in chicken muscle.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jean Simon"", ids = ""145639394""); list(name = ""Dragan Milenkovic"", ids = ""2549836""); list(name = ""Estelle Godet"", ids = ""5904122""); list(name = ""Cedric Cabau"", ids = ""2134852""); list(name = ""Anne Collin"", ids = ""144528348""); list(name = ""Sonia MÃ©tayer-Coustard"", ids = ""1398842382""); list(name = ""Nicole Rideau"", ids = ""5415156""); list(name = ""Sophie Tesseraud"", ids = ""3551305""); list(name = ""Michel Derouet"", ids = ""5575296""); list(name = ""Sabine Crochet"", ids = ""40350449""); list(name = ""Estelle Cailleau-Audouin"", ids = ""1405313107""); list(name = ""Christelle Hennequet-Antier"", ids = ""1387137992""); list(name = ""Christian P Gespach"", ids = ""3886169""); list(name = ""Tom E Porter"", ids = ""2982250""); list(name = ""Michel Jean Duclos"", ids = ""2222120""); list(name = ""JoÃ«lle Dupont"", ids = ""145889414""); list(name = ""Larry A.

e1552eb37f5fed97f3bacac7cc9ce15a46e4b316,Label-free profiling of white adipose tissue of rats exhibiting high or low levels of intrinsic exercise capacity.,"Divergent selection has created rat phenotypes of high- and low-capacity runners (HCR and LCR, respectively) that have differences in aerobic capacity and correlated traits such as adiposity. We analyzed visceral adipose tissue of HCR and LCR using label-free high-definition MS (elevated energy) profiling. The running capacity of HCR was ninefold greater than LCR. Proteome profiling encompassed 448 proteins and detected 30 significant (p <0.05; false discovery rate <10%, calculated using q-values) differences. Approximately half of the proteins analyzed were of mitochondrial origin, but there were no significant differences in the abundance of proteins involved in aerobic metabolism. Instead, adipose tissue of LCR rats exhibited greater abundances of proteins associated with adipogenesis (e.g. cathepsin D), ER stress (e.g. 78 kDa glucose response protein), and inflammation (e.g. Ig gamma-2B chain C region). Whereas the abundance antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] was greater in HCR tissue. Putative adipokines were also detected, in particular protein S100-B, was 431% more abundant in LCR adipose tissue.

6471e427395cbfbf8a2b1e3f3a1112ac28c31fa6,Cerebral blood flow features in chronic subcortical stroke: Lesion location-dependent study,"We investigated the influence of lesion location on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in chronic subcortical stroke patients. Three-dimensional pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling was employed to obtain CBF images in normal controls (NC) and patients with left hemisphere subcortical infarctions involving motor pathways. Stroke patients were divided into two subgroups based on the infarction location (basal ganglia (BS) or pontine (PS). We mapped CBF alterations in a voxel-wise manner and compared them to detect differences among groups with height-level false discovery rate correction. Regions with significant group differences were extracted to perform post hoc analyses among the BS, PS and NC groups using a general linear model with age, gender, years of education, and interval after stroke as covariates. The BS group displayed significantly increased CBF in the contralesional putamen relative to NC and significantly decreased CBF in the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex, ipsilesional thalamus and contralesional cerebellum. The PS group displayed significantly increased CBF in the contralesional inferior frontal gyrus relative to both the NC and BS groups. Nevertheless, the PS group showed significantly decreased CBF mainly in the cerebellum. Our results suggest different alteration patterns of CBF in chronic stroke patients with different infarct locations within subcortical motor pathways, potentially providing important information for the initiation of individualized rehabilitation strategies for subcortical stroke patients involving different infarct types.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Caihong Wang"", ids = ""48586574""); list(name = ""Peifang Miao"", ids = ""22242192""); list(name = ""Jingchun Liu"", ids = ""11074116""); list(name = ""Sen Wei"", ids = ""1880530""); list(name = ""Jingliang Cheng"", ids = ""7437983"")",,,Brain Research,1706,177-183
ba1192ad28df9765679fc82027e636c0e2e5dbd5,Sparse representation and Bayesian detection of genome copy number alterations from microarray data,"MOTIVATION
Genomic instability in cancer leads to abnormal genome copy number alterations (CNA) that are associated with the development and behavior of tumors. Advances in microarray technology have allowed for greater resolution in detection of DNA copy number changes (amplifications or deletions) across the genome. However, the increase in number of measured signals and accompanying noise from the array probes present a challenge in accurate and fast identification of breakpoints that define CNA. This article proposes a novel detection technique that exploits the use of piece wise constant (PWC) vectors to represent genome copy number and sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) to detect CNA breakpoints.


METHODS
First, a compact linear algebra representation for the genome copy number is developed from normalized probe intensities. Second, SBL is applied and optimized to infer locations where copy number changes occur. Third, a backward elimination (BE) procedure is used to rank the inferred breakpoints; and a cut-off point can be efficiently adjusted in this procedure to control for the false discovery rate (FDR).


RESULTS
The performance of our algorithm is evaluated using simulated and real genome datasets and compared to other existing techniques. Our approach achieves the highest accuracy and lowest FDR while improving computational speed by several orders of magnitude. The proposed algorithm has been developed into a free standing software application (GADA, Genome Alteration Detection Algorithm).

In the 144 LC/MS/MS raw files from human hippocampal tissues of control, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease, we identified the novel proteoforms with a workflow including integrated proteomic pipeline using three different search engines, MASCOT, SEQUEST, and MS-GF+. With a <1% false discovery rate (FDR) at the protein level, the 11 detected peptides mapped to four translated long noncoding RNA variants against the customized databases of GENCODE lncRNA, which also mapped to coding-proteins at different chromosomal sites. We also identified four novel ASVs against the customized databases of GENCODE transcript. The target peptides from the variants were validated by tandem MS fragmentation pattern from their corresponding synthetic peptides. Additionally, a total of 128 SAAVs paired with their wild-type peptides were identified with FDR <1% at the peptide level using a customized database from neXtProt including nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP) information. Among these results, several novel variants related in neuro-degenerative disease were identified using the workflow that could be applicable to C-HPP studies. All raw files used in this study were deposited in ProteomeXchange (PXD000395).",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Heeyoun Hwang"", ids = ""5657200""); list(name = ""Gun Wook Park"", ids = ""5661972""); list(name = ""Kwang Hoe Kim"", ids = ""11244814""); list(name = ""Ju Yeon Lee"", ids = ""48173788""); list(name = ""Hyun Kyoung Lee"", ids = ""46900469""); list(name = ""Eun Sun Ji"", ids = ""4785415""); list(name = ""Sung Kyu Robin Park"", ids = ""49591538""); list(name = ""Tao Xu"", ids = ""143706455""); list(name = ""John R.

The methodology is supported by theoretical results obtained in the special case where no noise dictionary is used. In this case, lasso-zero boils down to thresholding the basis pursuit solution. We prove that this procedure requires weaker conditions on $X$ and $S^0$ than the lasso for exact support recovery, and controls the false discovery rate for orthonormal designs when tuned by the quantile universal threshold. However it requires a high signal-to-noise ratio, and the use of noise dictionaries addresses this issue. The threshold selection procedure is based on a pivotal statistic and does not require knowledge of the noise level. Numerical simulations show that lasso-zero performs well in terms of support recovery and provides a good trade-off between high true positive rate and low false discovery rate compared to competitors.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Pascaline Descloux"", ids = ""13380158""); list(name = ""Sylvain Sardy"", ids = ""2769197"")",776c315eadd725a8190a4d7a1c538f6a456c5778; 76c021eabbd5c921f29ef9822dcdbfb0a4da2a5c; 19831805303d2860392b6e0118a4495db28b7607; eb22d0da7fdd9979a421d206aca82e5787a87048,eddb3766525ad09e831933782f9d210e15449065; 400b45a803d642b752a84147ef547af7811e8f3f; 6cf9b027aa09d042dd13fd9ae848d902240b3d34; 0beecd1fd6594ffafdcd483ee09e9cca7ebb29f8; 5c7416638acf9836d0bd2dbb5c269c8e07604ad4; 48d36579b83470650967b0c903e6af005ec10685; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; 3424286d6d39de51080ddd683646565545d015e2; d90a98dbd297e3b57f166ea139258660188792ed; 9af121fbed84c3484ab86df8f17f1f198ed790a0; ca14a857503ef4cdfe8f266c3061161d4f49f69b; dc423c0563ac6c80ae8af840c8560438644a0e59; f997cfd0c365572a90bd312ac9f50b80c21fba2b; e6676264d3af3604ee25f931aae78448b924fcf2; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 54205667c1f65a320f667d73c354ed8e86f1b9d9; c6a377d34d84a1c988070e193897623bb02dba69; daab979a418f96409774b3a7241cff2cac4d1be2; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; 17e7cca7e795d8ba1fa9d2c88bf2675c2d6ddfe8; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; f6295fd69d76d606f66cc15f58767a8161d60335; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; a50cda55ac39ec5096de1c6d83900f3d0130628d; 5e5f7b03044a218fcdf3c1e75a19cee9c0ad47b1; ae2118598c88a81d0bafcdc2d9706ff17944c307; 115221749c9505a8a305ab6df676d9b71ed1438c; 68d280f5924da97e28d5c1e89d3a404da8f1fb5b; 57cca95fdbd35ba1b283c9c6ec5ae7a81be7adfd; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 64a4094ccbbb7f00491b25ac9089b7b6a58be721; 7236864d8c2f62defea559465462c43a4b4b6b47; 50bdb364b5fa74e30422023738bbbd1e16bdab52; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; 1b60c4fddb8ab5475bc3295a2d0af4b1167bc444; 4abd724a05c5a61f00ad345971a4bc92d620f08a; 500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06; 07993804501ae4df9fe43cf8afb009ae38fe902e; 12e5939a80ec59f81214d7e729c577c350af9501; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 2540b36616761e6fde519eed00aef8f0e5e412a0; 77269f08b025aa4acc8e6039d4b11d17379bb9cd; 37e44d1de8003d8394d158ec6afd1ff0e87e595b,arXiv: Methodology,,
d6feab4ba744eb1964996137ebd44cacd4c8f23b,Using Global Metabolomics to Identify Novel Biomarkers of Treatment-Associated Cognitive Impairment in Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,"Central nervous system-directed chemotherapy is a critical component of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment, but is associated with long-term cognitive impairment. Because few strategies exist to identify children who are at risk for this adverse outcome, we employed global metabolomics to identify biomarkers of cognitive impairment using routinely collected, biologically relevant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients undergoing ALL chemotherapy. Methods: CSF samples were collected at 4 months post-induction on pediatric ALL patients enrolled in a multicenter prospective study of symptom toxicity. Metabolomics of CSF detected 314 metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Cognitive performance at 12 months post-induction was assessed with the validated Parent-Perceived Child Cognitive Function scale and categorized using published cut-points: mild (â‰¥50), moderate (41â€“49), and severe (â‰¤40). Ordinal logistic regression evaluated associations between normalized median-scaled metabolite values and cognitive function, adjusting for patient and treatment factors. A false discovery rate-corrected p-value (q) was calculated to account for multiple comparisons. Results: Among the 96 patients (diagnosed 2012â€“14), 43% exhibited moderate (n = 25) or severe (n = 16) cognitive impairment. Significant alterations were observed in several biomarkers, including methionine sulfoxide (Log2 Fold Change [FC] = 0.83, P = 5.2eâˆ’7, q = 0.001) and citramalate (FC = âˆ’0.29, P = 4.6eâˆ’5, q = 0.008).

METHODS We used a multiple linear regression approach to analyze cognitive outcome measures of rehabilitation volunteers with and without PD. RESULTS Significant associations were identified between increased age and decreased performance on 8 of the 14 outcomes analyzed after controlling for false discovery rate. Of those 8 outcomes, multivariate regression analyses demonstrated an effect of disease on performance in only 4/8. In all cases, PD was associated with superior, rather than decreased performance after controlling for age. Results were unaffected by sex and education. Post-hoc comparison with available age norms demonstrated that differences between PD and Non-PD volunteers could be primarily attributed to the Non-PD group substantially underperforming versus age norms. CONCLUSIONS In rehabilitative exercise studies using volunteers, many cognitive domains decline with increasing age, consistent with previous neuropsychological studies without a rehabilitation component. However, older â€œneurotypicalâ€ volunteers may potentially underperform PD volunteers after controlling for age. This may be an important design consideration for rehabilitation studies with cognitive outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION An increasing number of rehabilitation studies incorporate cognitive outcomes. Whether the overall cognitive profile of rehabilitation volunteers differs from that of neurotypical aging remains to be established. Rehabilitation volunteers with Parkinsonâ€™s disease may outperform putatively neurotypical volunteers after controlling for covariates. Cognitive impairments associated with PD in neuropsychological studies may not generalize to exercise rehabilitation volunteers.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""J.

876e6117e8c7496ab655eb445a54c35bdece0f24,Investigation of Cervical Tumor Biopsies for Chromosomal Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) and Microsatellite Instability (MSI) at the HLA II Locus in HIV-1/HPV Co-infected Women,"Background: A subgroup of women who are co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human papillomavirus (HPV) progress rapidly to cervical disease regardless of high CD4 counts. Chromosomal loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MSI) are early frequent genetic alterations occurring in solid tumors. Loss of an allele or part of a chromosome can have multiple functional effects on immune response genes, oncogenes, DNA damage-repair genes, and tumor-suppressor genes. To characterize the genetic alterations that may influence rapid tumor progression in some HIV-1-positive women, the extent of LOH and MSI at the HLA II locus on chromosome 6p in cervical tumor biopsy DNA samples with regard to HIV-1/HPV co-infection in South African women was investigated. Methods: A total of 164 women with cervical disease were recruited for this study, of which 74 were HIV-1-positive and 90 were HIV-1-seronegative. DNA from cervical tumors and matched buccal swabs were used for analyses. Six fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide primer pairs in a multiplex PCR amplification were used to study LOH and MSI. Pearson chi-squared test for homogeneity of proportions using an exact p value, a two-proportion Z-score test, ROC curves and a logistic regression model were used for statistical analyses. All p-values were corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg test and the adjusted p-values (q-values) were reported. All tests were significant when both p and q < 0.05. Results: Tumor DNA from HIV-1/HPV co-infected women demonstrated a higher frequency of LOH/MSI at the HLA II locus on chromosome 6p21.21 than tumor DNA from HIV-1-seronegative women (D6S2447, 74.2 vs. 42.6%; p = 0.001, q = 0.003), D6S2881 at 6p21.31 (78.3 vs. 42.9%; p = 0.002, q = 0.004), D6S2666 at 6p21.32 (79 vs. 57.1%; p = 0.035, q = 0.052), and D6S2746, at 6p21.33 (64.3 vs. 29.4%; p < 0.001, q < 0.001), respectively. Conclusions: HPV infection alone can induce LOH/MSI at the HLA II locus in cervical tumor DNA, whereas HIV-1 co-infection exacerbates it, suggesting that this may accelerate cervical disease progression in a subgroup of HIV-1-positive women.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ramadhani Salum Chambuso"", ids = ""20793759""); list(name = ""Evelyn Kaambo"", ids = ""22205064""); list(name = ""Lynette Denny"", ids = ""51371066""); list(name = ""Clive M.

b6a11ce04027faabcdf9dd147504eee67ddd7fa5,Target-small decoy search strategy for false discovery rate estimation,"BackgroundOne of the most important steps in peptide identification is to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR). The most commonly used method for estimating FDR is the target-decoy search strategy (TDS). While this method is simple and effective, it is time/space-inefficient because it searches a database that is twice as large as the original protein database. This inefficiency problem becomes more evident as protein databases get bigger and bigger. We propose a target-small decoy search strategy and present a rigorous verification that it reduces the database size and search time while retaining the accuracy of target-decoy search strategy (TDS).ResultsWe show that peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) obtained at 1% FDR in TDS overlap ~â€‰99% with those in our method. (Considering that 1% FDR is used, 99% overlap means our method is very accurate.) Moreover, our method is more time/space-efficient than TDS. The search time of our method is reduced to only 1/4 of that of TDS when UniProt and its 1/8 decoy database are used.ConclusionsWe demonstrate that our method is almost as accurate as TDS and more time/space-efficient than TDS. Since the efficiency of our method is more evident as the database size increases, our method is expected to be useful for identifying peptides in proteogenomics databases constructed from inflated databases using genomic data.",2019,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hyun-woo Kim"", ids = ""66185025""); list(name = ""Sangjeong Lee"", ids = ""1472877347""); list(name = ""Heejin Park"", ids = ""152467097"")",,c283bf27e550b8d82ca84923fd846bf8eabf2bd6; 8c1a1e761b715b23668b4f850e2bcc958fa21ad2; 61313b8af26e91b863c6129387fc92e0df4f9949; 0c8477e3f08fc9c43a65002cd1f92df83bbbc872; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; f86a9d5269d4cc1bc6218ae3566b573572130665; f390e53848813184a170766b4d6dcbcb4d1aaaee; fc8e5b33b2f49e2c15f524f2e3a7a1185e0501b0; e45a8d7176bd738c1e63de1f6791a88e704f8b4b; b9f956cb2e3395c180d9a90f507c535fe8dcc655; 241bb83c7e194a9c37227d45621d8a878de2e828; 5bb8fd41296f6e23683eb125350ce9517db9bbd1; 631fe3da480f8d903f574cfb89f6d06c1cef6947; a7a581f7f052570fa099dcb887b9934617760791,BMC Bioinformatics,20,
ddfc1dca46e74ea098636f8130a1875e69887fb6,Hippocampal subfield atrophy in patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease and psychosis,"Psychosis, manifested through formed visual hallucinations or minor hallucinations, is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). The pathogenesis of psychosis in PD remains unclear; however, is possibly linked to structural and functional alterations in the hippocampus. To explore the role of hippocampus in psychosis, a detailed hippocampal subfield analysis was performed on PD patients with (PD-P) and without psychosis (PD-NP), and healthy controls (HC). An automated subfield parcellation was performed on T1 MRI images of 141 subjects (PD-P:42, PD-NP:51, and HC:48). The volumes of 12 subfields on each side were estimated and analyzed between the three groups andÂ were corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rates. The volumes were also correlated to psychosis severity and specific neuropsychological tests and finally were employed to predict the psychosis severity in PD-P using a support vector regression (SVR) model. Compared to controls, PD-NP group did not demonstrate any significant differences; however, the PD-P group had significantly lower total hippocampal volume. Bilateral molecular layer, granule cell-dentate gyrus, left subiculum, and hippocampal tail and right CA3, CA4, and HATA illustrated significantly lower volumes, while bilateral hippocampal fissure demonstrated a significantÂ widening. Compared to PD-NP, the PD-P group had higher volume of the bilateral hippocampal fissures. Finally, SVR could significantly predict the psychosis severity from all the subfield volumes. Our findings indicate a higher degeneration of specific hippocampal subfields in PD-P compared to controls and a trend of higher volume of hippocampal fissures in PD-P group than in PD-NP.",2018,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Abhishek Lenka"", ids = ""2366124""); list(name = ""Madhura Ingalhalikar"", ids = ""47426760""); list(name = ""Apurva Shah"", ids = ""145825977""); list(name = ""Jitender Saini"", ids = ""33098909""); list(name = ""Shyam Sundar Arumugham"", ids = ""3537405""); list(name = ""Shantala Hegde"", ids = ""35583033""); list(name = ""Lija George"", ids = ""33675950""); list(name = ""Venkateswara Reddy"", ids = ""144540454""); list(name = ""Y C Janardhana Reddy"", ids = ""153320790""); list(name = ""Ravi Yadav"", ids = ""81905860""); list(name = ""Pramod Kumar Pal"", ids = ""2855127"")",990a019ae514e88fcbd09e8a950f2a24c96f05d0; 60ecebab5e0e48cf7e94b6becf717cd1b6d66337; bdcd3aa7bd1bb39f241c9938e6e3c055967fb5de,0a995afa8d3c114b2b431c4e2737777a0e051bff; 3a303ae3271835bd8d11ad421f9a731aa2863fee; 065160db86ab582ccb5b3f52e221b2964c8bd9ee; 97f3b381e2ac6ec21aabfa6868764c395b01a565; 80bd4c0a4da97389dcd16e7e9a9a434d039e279f; 8e38a3fd905002db884b84aa11137eaa8e56bdf0; c9ace0c7d8edf313ebb913c9a6e9a857a29544dc; 2a3e529863ee19fd39613987ace7b06023a2951f; b39cc9363087911fe66075a9725bfc98d9c10875; 868996886f1b9c0de40c6471b619fd70446d1d6b; 59a42a3befcfca0c82c6fc254b48de227cd2f722; de0409b350cb01b7ab7ad86e8a9358382f2b7d86; 347a22f31bbd18b19b30a08bb09cbdf8441f2376; 8b5f7fd5327c5c216fc2c47744ecc64b9613b751; 68be583635a22f6cdd1edec6b5265278e935819a; 728e759a8c83c6602adf3afe4984f98c11db97e4; 50318ffd8f4363f7e1e0ab26871ba6f310ad321e; 44839b4d58edcdbe2c13880cd41b672ce034fdc7; 06bb5771e6b8a9356c5f4ae28c98b4397c043349; 92a8dd122c8b2f9eec8d15de7af0d6b508f693b1; cf9c24330f3978ff7d72739e0cb8e19dd66628ab; 299ceab7d9f9da8d9e573871aebf1b871a2b0613; 7de15892881a6ec97d55791f13732dedc5111536; d8c44b1cd38a27c78af9c9444d8be019e2f26417; 216be71cfc52a5e903a751f1a9e6dd399c85db9c; 2ed0061417b0e8a99d1d813a8265e0b1cd0b1fa2; 773f89272d1b4f4fdb1dca6bb85225287042255f; 28de9e3ee26c99fa5f9e7fd897e3933898a747ef; 018b056424280ac4936e5988106dc17e26b1354f; d2f2a271b1ee1032117519f5190c1790711a0a73; cbba4a717e89a1f75294dcb8278646626d9265bf; 1392351fe1b076724511273bfa5aa8634411fe81; bdda7edc2306c571f22dbc0bbee8ddf2364ddcab; 6a0a8e76f9cacf0eca355d0083abc77ff2a88f9b; 78a2fb57564b2dd9e580ace70bd43f5392e5e7ff; d2035c2aedfa65c9c7f8cbe3c07f6c1ad99230af; 7e0965d443bd43ba500c2e16dee6a0dc5ca003a6; f1721eb92609fbc1a945e7a249c1fd4944f0d11f; 068178900b24920474909ffa12b0ab9bf7cc6837; dec34e7b0bae8861a1ead3c0781959bd97f7a1fe; a836287bf993b9a7f5cd389d0a6dcc92f836c43c; 89b5e2e9c8f28cb41ffb9e79468725f7641930c3; 756492288e5b5ce471ac1286e9e2aa453d8f9e16; 4937aa5f69a8280eab2b3b716fec8a2fbf0d98af; 9a851f5b7cffae55f4bdfd9c9cd96210dfed6d46; 44ec7cdfcb9326a0f84b11cc3d9e9169201742a7; c6570424909d691ca0d96cb602d3dfe240f08c60; a81da329d1faa2d3a6a20ed26ecfc403ae21d3ac; 828d3a0341b041c18f55c06913f7e5870b4874b7,Journal of Neural Transmission,125,1361-1372
8f642bebc89fcbbaba60c3e651839d7eacb3ccc5,Robust Semiparametric Optimal Testing Procedure for Multiple Normal Means,"In high-dimensional gene expression experiments such as microarray and RNA-seq experiments, 
the number of measured variables is huge while the number of replicates is small. As a 
consequence, hypothesis testing is challenging because the power of tests can be very low after 
controlling multiple testing error. Optimal testing procedures with high average power while 
controlling false discovery rate are preferred. Many methods were constructed to achieve high 
power through borrowing information across genes. Some of these methods can be shown to 
achieve the optimal average power across genes, but only under a normal assumption of 
alternative means. However, the assumption of a normal distribution is likely violated in practice. 
In this paper, we propose a novel semiparametric optimal testing (SPOT) procedure for high-dimensional 
data with small sample size. Our procedure is more robust because it does not 
depend on any parametric assumption for the alternative means. We show that the proposed test 
achieves the maximum average power asymptotically as the number of tests goes to infinity. 
Both simulation study and the analysis of a real microarray data with spike-in probes show that 
the proposed SPOT procedure performs better when compared to other popularly applied 
procedures.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Peng Liu"", ids = ""39336958""); list(name = ""Chong Wang"", ids = ""47074522"")",,178e55a6ef96feeefe5c34b1822f4df9aed2a049; 5b888a8ff491548cce78385636dd1e5ea1b93cbe; cfc36464bd56c7395d27712a0e03bf2bf06342a6; 94ec9bac04a5fb1072cd9718ff396e4289d857eb; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 8fca88218248ae342b936bb0b9d0c3c69b4cbb14; 4ae003c0a447922e2136e96cbd8987b90fbc19e8; 1bdb480f609c7828f36f52f6b0ec33dbe2c8e65e; 9f4c2f54dbe5d946dd4e690e00b93865bd456f3a; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 97cc7ab1b0d200d38f802bfc26c7315fb4a07ce3; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083,Journal of Probability and Statistics,2012,913560
77b2f94e3a4c9925041d5970f18d8b0b76db4b32,MaXLinker: proteome-wide cross-link identifications with high specificity and sensitivity.,"Protein-protein interactions play a vital role in nearly all cellular functions. Hence, understanding their interaction patterns and three-dimensional structural conformations can provide crucial insights about various biological processes and underlying molecular mechanisms for many disease phenotypes. Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has the unique capability to detect protein-protein interactions at a large scale along with spatial constraints between interaction partners. The inception of MS-cleavable cross-linkers enabled the MS2-MS3 XL-MS acquisition strategy that provides cross-link information from both MS2 and MS3 level. However, the current cross-link search algorithm available for MS2-MS3 strategy that follow an ""MS2-centric"" approach, suffer from a high rate of mis-identified cross-links. We demonstrate the problem with the help of two new quality assessment metrics ('fraction of mis-identifications' (FMI) and 'fraction of interprotein cross-links from known interactions' (FKI)). We then address this problem, by designing a novel ""MS3-centric"" approach for cross-link identification and implementing it as a search engine called MaXLinker. MaXLinker significantly outperforms the currently popular search engine with significantly lower mis-identification rate, with superior sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, we performed human proteome-wide cross-linking mass spectrometry using K562 cells. Employing MaXLinker, we identified a comprehensive set of 9,319 unique cross-links at 1% false discovery rate, comprising 8,051 intraprotein and 1,268 interprotein cross-links. Finally, we experimentally validated the quality of a large number of novel interactions identified in our study, providing a conclusive evidence for MaXLinker's robust performance.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Kumar Yugandhar"", ids = ""1470786623""); list(name = ""Ting-Yi Wang"", ids = ""121576324""); list(name = ""Alden King-Yung Leung"", ids = ""3274119""); list(name = ""Michael Charles Lanz"", ids = ""49548727""); list(name = ""Ievgen Motorykin"", ids = ""137767188""); list(name = ""Jin Rui Liang"", ids = ""145349593""); list(name = ""Elnur Elyar Shayhidin"", ids = ""16285685""); list(name = ""Marcus Bustamante Smolka"", ids = ""40576547""); list(name = ""Shangmin Zhang"", ids = ""48692349""); list(name = ""Haiyuan Yu"", ids = ""145339878"")",,,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,,

Understanding such a control on a genomic level involves deciphering the mechanisms and structures of regulatory programmes and networks. A difficulty arises due to the weak signal and high noise in various sources of data while most current approaches are limited to analysis of a single source of data. A natural alternative is to improve statistical efficiency and power by a combined analysis of multiple sources of data. Here we propose a shrinkage method to combine genome-wide location data and gene expression data to detect the binding sites or target genes of a transcription factor. Specifically, a prior 'non-target' gene list is generated by analysing the expression data, and then this information is incorporated into the subsequent binding data analysis via a shrinkage method. There is a Bayesian justification for this shrinkage method. Both simulated and real data were used to evaluate the proposed method and compare it with analysing binding data alone. In simulation studies, the proposed method gives higher sensitivity and lower false discovery rate (FDR) in detecting the target genes. In real data example, the proposed method can reduce the estimated FDR and increase the power to detect the previously known target genes of a broad transcription regulator, leucine responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) in Escherichia coli.

17747ebfa63669b73f9c27ab98c607fb481fbd99,Peripheral blood gene expression changes during allergen inhalation challenge in atopic asthmatic individuals.,"OBJECTIVES
(1) To investigate the effects of globin mRNA depletion in detecting differential gene expression in peripheral blood and (2) to investigate changes in peripheral blood gene expression in atopic asthmatic individuals undergoing allergen inhalation challenge.


METHODS
Asthmatic subjects (20-60 years of age, with stable, mild allergic asthma, n = 9) underwent allergen inhalation challenges. All had an early asthmatic response of â‰¥20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Blood was collected immediately prior to and 2 hours after allergen challenge using PAXgene tubes (n = 4) and EDTA tubes (n = 5). Aliquots of the PAXgene blood samples were subjected to globin reduction (PAX-GR). Transcriptome analysis was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip(Â®) Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. Data were preprocessed using factor analysis for robust microarray summarization and analyzed using linear models for microarrays. Pathway analyses were performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.


RESULTS
Globin reduction uncovered probe sets of lower abundance. However, it significantly reduced the ability to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) when compared to non-globin-reduced PAXgene samples (PAX-NGR). Combined transcriptional analysis of four PAX-NGR and five EDTA sample pairs identified 1595 DEGs associated with allergen inhalation challenge (false discovery rate â‰¤ 5%), with the top-ranked network of perturbed biological functions consisting of inflammatory response, cellular movement, and immune cell trafficking.


CONCLUSIONS
While we have demonstrated a diminished ability to detect DEGs after globin reduction, we have nevertheless identified significant changes in the peripheral blood transcriptome of people with mild asthma 2 hours after allergen inhalation challenge.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sarah H.

bfc9e7c1057802fde3d2c7c6ecc766f4e234af2d,csaw: a Bioconductor package for differential binding analysis of ChIP-seq data using sliding windows,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) is widely used to identify binding sites for a target protein in the genome. An important scientific application is to identify changes in protein binding between different treatment conditions, i.e. to detect differential binding. This can reveal potential mechanisms through which changes in binding may contribute to the treatment effect. The csaw package provides a framework for the de novo detection of differentially bound genomic regions. It uses a window-based strategy to summarize read counts across the genome. It exploits existing statistical software to test for significant differences in each window. Finally, it clusters windows into regions for output and controls the false discovery rate properly over all detected regions. The csaw package can handle arbitrarily complex experimental designs involving biological replicates. It can be applied to both transcription factor and histone mark datasets, and, more generally, to any type of sequencing data measuring genomic coverage. csaw performs favorably against existing methods for de novo DB analyses on both simulated and real data. csaw is implemented as a R software package and is freely available from the open-source Bioconductor project.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Aaron T.

However, the mechanisms of regulation at the transcriptomic level were not well studied. So, we conducted a RNA-Seq analysis of MeJA-treated Chinese cabbage leaf transcriptome. Among 27,461 detected genes, 1451 genes were up-regulated and 991 genes were down-regulated as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (log2 of the fold change in gene expression â‰¥1, false discovery rate â‰¤0.001). More than 90% of the DEGs were between 2.0- and 8.0-fold changes. The most highly represented pathways by 1674 annotated DEGs were related to â€œmetabolic pathwaysâ€ (333 members). Fourteen genes involved in JA biosynthesis pathway were up-regulated. Forty genes for glucosinolate biosynthesis were induced, and the level of indole glucosinolate was highly increased by MeJA treatment. Several selected genes involved in JA signaling and indole glucosinolate synthesis pathways were validated by quantitative RT-PCR.

427c2af7928b5f3fbcdaf51327ddda5d2f93920a,Neuroticism modulates neural activities of posterior cingulate cortex and thalamus during psychosocial stress processing.,"OBJECTIVE
Individuals with higher neuroticism are vulnerable to stress and are prone to develop depression, however, the neural mechanisms underlying it have not been clarified clearly.


METHOD
The Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST) was administered to 148 healthy adults during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Whole-brain voxel-wise regression analyses were used to detect associations of neuroticism with neural activity involved in perceiving and processing psychosocial stress. In addition, two-sample t-tests were conducted between the high-neurotic and low-neurotic group in order to supplement the results found in regression analyses.


RESULTS
Higher neuroticism scores were associated with higher activities in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus and thalamus (p < 0.05, false discovery rate correction). Moreover, two sample t-tests also revealed that the high-neurotic group had higher neural stress responses in precuneus and bilateral thalamus in comparison to the low-neurotic group (p < 0.05, false discovery rate correction).


LIMITATIONS
Our study mainly recruited young adults, which may limit the generalizability of our findings.

b578cff30236d2d5b6560267d34ba9fb0110220e,Diffusion Abnormalities in Young Drug Naive ADHD Children,"Background: ADHD is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders, with a prevalence of 5-10% in school age children. Numerous structural studies attest to the fact that ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in multiple, inter-connected brain areas, such as limbic and fronto-striato-cerebellar networks. Unlike structural studies, far less is known about potential developmental abnormalities in white matter (WM). This is important given the fact that ADHD patients have dopamine (DA) dysfunction and DA has been reported to have a direct role in modifying the proliferation, migration, and/or differentiation of oligodendrocytes[1], the cell type responsible for axonal myelination. Despite the link between DA and myelination, little is known about the developmental trajectory of WM in the ADHD brain. To our knowledge this is the first DTI study in a group of young ADHD children (7-11 years old) who were completely drug naive. Materials and Method: Participants consisted of 20 drug-naÃ¯ve ADHD patients and 25 demographically matched (age, gender, handedness, SES, ethnicity, IQ) healthy controls (HC). Images were obtained on GE 1.5 T magnet with 25 non-linear gradient directions for b=1000 obtaining 23 contagious slices parallel to AC-PC plane with 5 mm thickness covering the whole brain. The details of the image registration and voxelwise analysis have been published and described in detail elsewhere. Following completion of the image registration procedures, we obtain a spatially normalized FA volume for each subject. Voxels with the high statistical significance were thresholded from the final t-map differences obtained comparing the normalized FA volumes between groups. To reduce the false positive rate due to multiple comparisons, we set an extent threshold of at least 100 contiguous voxels at a false discovery rate corrected. Results: Voxelwise analysis results were superimposed on the averaged normalized 3D of all subjects and are presented in Figures 1. Results show areas where ADHD naÃ¯ve children showed increased FA (â‰¥100 contiguous connected voxels (cc), fdr corrected p<0.05; uncorrected p<0.003) as compared to their matched HCs. Figure 1 depicts clusters of increased FA abnormalities along the fronto-striato-ponto-cerebellar circuit and along the limbic network (orbital frontal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and temporal lobe). Pearson's correlation analysis showed significant positive correlations (r=.67; p<.004) between the left cerebellum FA values and Conner's parent hyperactivity/impulsivity raw scores (Figure 2). Conclusion: Involvement of the fronto-striata-ponto-cerebellar and limbic circuits in ADHD children has been well documented in prior ADHD neuroimaging reports. Recent DTI studies report both high and low FA in many brain regions when comparing ADHD subjects and matched controls. The discrepancies in the findings and inconsistent brain areas reported may be due to the broad age ranges studied, failure to control for medication status, comorbid conditions, poorly matched comparison groups (e.g. IQ), and/or suboptimal imaging methodology. The increased FA finding may indicaticate that ADHD children have a different WM trajectory that is delayed compared to HCs. Positive correlations of the FA cluster in the left cerebellum with hyperactivity scores shows that increased FA is a sign of brain abnormality in these unmedicated children. We believe the WM abnormalities reported here may be due to dopamine dysfunction along with a delay in normal brain developmental processes of synaptic pruning and cell and axonal elimination that are followed by active periods of myelination.",2010,,"list(name = ""Manzar Ashtari"", ids = ""144856787""); list(name = ""Carolyn McIlree"", ids = ""145853644""); list(name = ""Melissa Naraine"", ids = ""7442571""); list(name = ""Laura L Cyckowski"", ids = ""4035297""); list(name = ""Ruth L.

9486843c5a8c64c6b6acbc6a836f1f4224a52cce,"Comment on ""Correlated z-values and the accuracy of large-scale statistical estimates"" by Bradley Efron.","In a series of recent articles, Bradley Efron has pointed out that in large-scale multiple testing problems, the observed distribution of the test statistics often does not match the theoretical null distribution (Efron, 2004, 2007a,b, 2008). The correction, which he termed â€œempirical nullâ€, has been a subject of controversy in the statistical community. In Efron (2007a), he made the case that, even when the theoretical model is correct, the observed distribution of the test statistics can look different from the theoretical null distribution simply because of correlation between the test statistics. 
 
Efronâ€™s present article represents an important step forward in the understanding of this problem. As opposed to previous papers, where the the effect of correlation was treated within the context of multiple testing problems and false discovery rates, Efronâ€™s present article breaks through the confusion by separating these two concepts and focusing on the core issue, which is the behavior of a large collection of correlated normal variables. Only then, as applications, he presents the implications for false discovery rate analysis when the correlated normal variables are z-scores in a large-scale multiple testing problem. I think this separation is crucial and helps get us nearer a new theory of inference for high-dimensional data. 
 
In what follows, I present my own interpretation of Efronâ€™s results on how correlation affects the empirical distribution of normal variables. As a shortcut, I work in the countinous domain directly rather than with histogram bins and avoid the inclusion of unnecessary constraints such as normalization, which applies very specifically to microarray data. For simplicity, I assume all the variables are standard normal rather than belonging to a mixture model, but may have an arbitrary correlation structure. 
 
Using these results, I hope to answer the question raised in Efron (2007a) of whether large-scale correlation can substantially widen the observed histogram, as in Figure 1 in that paper and Efronâ€™s current one. The theoretical arguments below indicate that this is unlikely. On the contrary, large-scale correlation has to be mostly positive in order to satisfy positive definite contraints, and as a result, correlation will most likely narrow and shift the observed histogram rather than widen it. An important implication is that a wide histogram may be an indication of the presence of true signal, rather than an artifact of correlation. 
 
Having a model for the observed distribution under correlation, I will suggest a new way of fitting an empirical null, which may be more appropriate in cases where the observed widening is larger than could be explained by correlation alone. I will conclude commenting briefly on the possibility of performing this kind of analysis with Ï‡2 variates rather than normal. 
 
I will try to keep the notation close to that of Efron, but some discrepancies in notation will be inevitable.",2010,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Armin Schwartzman"", ids = ""46676238"")",d28abd4db4d1c21e2750cb51b1a3f005e6356d77; ab8adcea4ce5581278ae508d7b012f54d292dcbf,,Journal of the American Statistical Association,105 491,"

Patients who fail to respond to conventional DMARDs move on to biologic drugs, however 30% will fail to respond to the first drug tried. Biologics are trialled for at least 3 months before their efficacy can be assessed, during which time irreversible joint damage may occur. Currently there is no way to predict which drug will be effective in individual patients. It is therefore a research priority to develop a method to predict response to each class of biologic drug. I hypothesise that the immune phenotype of a patient will influence treatment response. Objectives This study aims to immunophenotype T cells using mass cytometry and to test novel unbiased methods of analysing high-dimensional data. Methods Ten healthy controls (HC) and 10 RA patients with established disease were included. T cells were isolated and stimulated for 4 hours using anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads in the presence of monensin and brefeldin A. Cells were stained with a 37-channel mass cytometry panel including surface markers, intracellular antigens and transcription factors. Analysis was performed by conventional biaxial gating alongside tools available on the MRC Cytobank platform, namely Visual t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (viSNE), and Cluster identification, characterization, and regression (CITRUS). The CITRUS analysis compared stimulated HC with RA T cells. To compare abundances of cell clusters, the association model Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAMR) was applied with a minimum cluster size of 2.2%, 5 cross-validation folds and a false discovery rate of 1%. Results Conventional biaxial gating showed that there were large differences in the proportions of both IFN&ggr;+ CD4 T cells (1â€“15%) and IL-17A+ CD4 T cells (0â€“9%) within and between RA and HC. The proportion of IFN&ggr;+ CD4 T cells (Th1) did not correlate with that of IL-17A + T cells (Th17), leading to the generation of 4 immunophenotypes: â€œTh1â€, â€œTh17â€, â€œdouble-hiâ€, and â€œlowâ€, determined by cytokine expression. Using CITRUS we identified 3 clusters of cells which differed significantly in abundance between HC and RA. Cluster 1 was CD4+CD38+, had characteristics of regulatory T cells and was more abundant in HC. Cluster 2 was CD28lowCD8+ expressing perforin and Tbet, and cluster 3 a CD127highCCR6+population, both of which were more abundant in RA. Conclusions Cytokine expression of ex vivo stimulated T cells from RA and HC is highly variable and can be detected using mass cytometry. Cytokine signatures of this kind may be informative when predicting treatment response. CITRUS identified 3 cell clusters which may have been missed using conventional methods of analysis. Importantly, CITRUS allowed inspection of the phenotype of each cluster. Our next step is to compare RA responders to non-responders using the methods described. The function of these clusters will be further investigated by cell isolation with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and may go some way in predicting treatment response. Finally we recommend the use of both automated clustering algorithms alongside conventional gating methods when analysing high-dimensional data.

13fb6d62399c5c54ff9105dc5e97df78e5945867,Autoantigens in the trabecular meshwork and glaucomaâ€specific alterations in the natural autoantibody repertoire,"Objectives
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a neurodegenerative disorder leading to a gradual vision loss caused by progressive damage to the optic nerve. Immunological processes are proposed to be involved in POAG pathogenesis. Altered serological autoantibody levels have been frequently reported, but complete analyses of the natural autoantibodies with respect to disease-related alterations are scarce. Here, we provide an explorative analysis of pathways and biological processes that may involve naturally immunogenic proteins and highlight POAG-specific alterations.


Methods
Mass spectrometry-based antibody-mediated identification of autoantigens (MS-AMIDA) was carried out in healthy and glaucomatous trabecular meshwork (TM) cell lines, using antibody pools purified from serum samples of 30 POAG patients and 30 non-glaucomatous subjects. Selected antigens were validated by protein microarray (nÂ =Â 120). Bioinformatic assessment of identified autoantigens, including Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction networks, was applied.


Results
Overall, we identified 106 potential autoantigens [false discovery rate (FDR)Â <Â 0.01], from which we considered 66 as physiological targets of natural autoantibodies. Twenty-one autoantigens appeared to be related to POAG. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) pathway involved in TM fibrosis was particularly rich in POAG-related antigens. Antibodies to threonine-tRNA ligase (TARS), component 1 Q subcomponent-binding protein (C1QBP) and paraneoplastic antigen Ma2 (PNMA2) showed significantly (PÂ <Â 0.05) higher levels in POAG patients as validated by protein microarray.


Conclusion
This study provides new insights into autoimmunity in health and glaucoma. Bioinformatic analysis of POAG-related autoantigens showed a strong association with the PDGFRB pathway and also increased levels of PNMA2, TARS, and C1QBP autoantibodies in the serum of POAG patients as potential glaucoma biomarkers.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Vanessa M.

df4761a6bec15e2941bd818630d200dd5c781e53,Param-Medic: A Tool for Improving MS/MS Database Search Yield by Optimizing Parameter Settings.,"In shotgun proteomics analysis, user-specified parameters are critical to database search performance and therefore to the yield of confident peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). Two of the most important parameters are related to the accuracy of the mass spectrometer. Precursor mass tolerance defines the peptide candidates considered for each spectrum. Fragment mass tolerance or bin size determines how close observed and theoretical fragments must be to be considered a match. For either of these two parameters, too wide a setting yields randomly high-scoring false PSMs, whereas too narrow a setting erroneously excludes true PSMs, in both cases, lowering the yield of peptides detected at a given false discovery rate. We describe a strategy for inferring optimal search parameters by assembling and analyzing pairs of spectra that are likely to have been generated by the same peptide ion to infer precursor and fragment mass error. This strategy does not rely on a database search, making it usable in a wide variety of settings.

512b37cf8cbb7b7174ccacdbcfddac4e3cde9dac,Agricultural activities and the incidence of Parkinsonâ€™s disease in the general French population,"Most studies on pesticides and Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) focused on occupational exposure in farmers. Whether non-occupational exposure is associated with PD has been little explored. We investigated the association between agricultural characteristics and PD incidence in a French nationwide ecologic study. We hypothesized that persons living in regions with agricultural activities involving more intensive pesticide use would be at higher risk. We identified incident PD cases from French National Health Insurance databases (2010â€“2012). The proportion of land dedicated to 18 types of agricultural activities was defined at the canton of residence level. We examined the association between agricultural activities and PD age/sex-standardized incidence ratios using multivariable multilevel Poisson regression adjusted for smoking, deprivation index, density of neurologists, and rurality (proportion of agricultural land); we used a false discovery rate approach to correct for multiple comparisons and compute q-values. We also compared incidence in clusters of cantons with similar agricultural characteristics (k-means algorithm). We identified 69,010 incident PD cases. Rurality was associated with higher PD incidence (pÂ <Â 0.001). Cantons with higher density of vineyards displayed the strongest association (RRtop/bottom quartileÂ =Â 1.102, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.049â€“1.158; q-trendÂ =Â 0.040). This association was similar in men, women, and non-farmers, stronger in older than younger persons, and present in all French regions. Persons living in the cluster with greatest vineyards density had 8.5% (4.4â€“12.6%) higher PD incidence (pÂ <Â 0.001). In France, vineyards rank among the crops that require most intense pesticide use. Regions with greater presence of vineyards are characterized by higher PD risk; non-professional pesticides exposure is a possible explanation.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sofiane Kab"", ids = ""3936039""); list(name = ""Johan Spinosi"", ids = ""3523152""); list(name = ""Laura Chaperon"", ids = ""12783530""); list(name = ""Aline Dugravot"", ids = ""3982555""); list(name = ""Archana Singh-Manoux"", ids = ""1398081316""); list(name = ""FrÃ©dÃ©ric Moisan"", ids = ""1841579""); list(name = ""Alexis Elbaz"", ids = ""145323647"")",b18ddb2e575c6220a823d96b3ad56b7685414062; 55496087eceb93b153932bc24483f93c2f47586a; d1c57eda520d3d11c93acc335099e8792ed57839; 96df98c7d02e69536a8284f303d10cadf6a31a8a; 52bf0f542d221f1aa5c4f06c483afc0045e07048; d4766a54d6570c6b6c6d640bb5f053b891f800d7; 67b9cdfbff43f6a9cfc6f49fedfb9814b465d447; c4fe85de0c18805bc914bb34db55968a81c351b6; 2783ff6978deffc7ae81c0e133e389f3db42366b; 74b227e3e4d56f91585d3a04ce0cb5e87c740441,5532808e2013f45c8381b68bc626545d1828d4c1; eeaa0003407dc8b2ab152345b1483d6d29532b7c; fb835dba03dc4d55f9e45eed835f44c882704eaf; 190bb648f7fa43091083a1fb8faab176b7e6c9f2; 8611167e1d5c763ec79735d0413066474f0333b2; 3c6bbdea7f23283ac646863217a144e574c54431; 485e37ba09eed95b2af839a225eb0f7c3b543df9; a5bd40dac5ee16aaf996a9b5dc627be655cbb9e0; d9ffa214f9ae7697e80463d346dc1fe0a71c09fd; b57cebc172351b5a4818aac5b202c46a782ac68b; 03d95f7ac7caa2226a7e43eef9d6cfd296cfcd39; 2e8e9462731a63b6398628cadae36337c1168247; cbc9d60a59be016fab0f51c4e6d7b2dacf452ac5; 9310f830af26a471aac0e657df0d5cf97a067495; 7303ebd1c54ae3bc9c0976ec41ae72371c5ba9cf; 037aed6f9702d6c5fb179d5f08d681c0c5f59fe3; 8866169c6a5cdfbbf734cfd2db11d89739135cc5; 7135d0660e1956a1cdeb1580423ff97b948118b8; 02c0c8bd8fff37b6cbc86cf4c5e31528f3d17459; 5c9530083f02a0d6c42c969289d987f3e381c1ad; 08fc3e2265df8ac829be90458c55249b397d878c; a7caab379e00e11ae2b84d26deb429ded35b6865; 45d2202a3395d91c24e4480419e7dfe8ba131b0c; b86b380fc05979c8dae103d4f1b4f66533928e9f; 01f468fb2f5d504a241050a6ac9b20b45e9136c5; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 76a23f71c09120685cc1dbb15a94a81e42db420b; a535a2b5008e5a8689430da3e6d6a88de34605dd; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; e278a9cfb434b2d5de174efc90887b04e84c09ba; 52b7962f87cb1c3386ca742c6a5d906757930da9; 506176cf8e77801837ff2684ecd3e6a02ecd1dad; 10ea15177ad3fdda5fb5bad8c75957e833e5f61b; 23110caa975f83a25e32bdcef88dc02d6878c523; 56e868d776ec6cd338cea46819221053fb79207a; 835bb17ab8b5fd11fea1bc790e8ffc20d0553f5d,European Journal of Epidemiology,32,203-216
bd1ffea7381c9a95ae114143bc786d4d5ffc9eca,Statistical evaluation of methods for identification of differentially abundant genes in comparative metagenomics,"BackgroundMetagenomics is the study of microbial communities by sequencing of genetic material directly from environmental or clinical samples. The genes present in the metagenomes are quantified by annotating and counting the generated DNA fragments. Identification of differentially abundant genes between metagenomes can provide important information about differences in community structure, diversity and biological function. Metagenomic data is however high-dimensional, contain high levels of biological and technical noise and have typically few biological replicates. The statistical analysis is therefore challenging and many approaches have been suggested to date.ResultsIn this article we perform a comprehensive evaluation of 14 methods for identification of differentially abundant genes between metagenomes. The methods are compared based on the power to detect differentially abundant genes and their ability to correctly estimate the type I error rate and the false discovery rate. We show that sample size, effect size, and gene abundance greatly affect the performance of all methods. Several of the methods also show non-optimal model assumptions and biased false discovery rate estimates, which can result in too large numbers of false positives. We also demonstrate that the performance of several of the methods differs substantially between metagenomic data sequenced by different technologies.ConclusionsTwo methods, primarily designed for the analysis of RNA sequencing data (edgeR and DESeq2) together with a generalized linear model based on an overdispersed Poisson distribution were found to have best overall performance. The results presented in this study may serve as a guide for selecting suitable statistical methods for identification of differentially abundant genes in metagenomes.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Viktor Jonsson"", ids = ""22191062"");

569c73a6c053a1989b54da2decc2a8905bd90d50,Divergent selection experiments: a powerful tool for unravelling the genetic regulation of complex traits.,"In mammals, mice growth divergent selection experiments have historically been a key tool to understand how selection shapes phenotypic and genetic variation. However, how selection for a particular trait operates at the transcriptomic level in mammals is still not well known. A significant genome-wide conservation of expression levels has been observed between humans and mice. Nevertheless, knowledge of whether the expression of these genes is regulating equivalent complex traits in both species and human is still limited. In this study, we use embryos of four inbred lines of mice derived from long-term divergent selection for growth to identify genes with transcript expression correlated to selection. We also explore whether those genes are associated with human traits linked to the selected one. Results showed 3871 transcripts differential expressed (DE) between lines and replicating in both experiments at False discovery rate <0.05. The genes of these transcripts showed a clear enrichment for embryo weight, embryo growth retardation and body weight in mouse and for height and body mass index (BMI) in GWAS studies in human. From these genes, we identified 417 transcripts with expression correlated to embryo weight after adjusting for line. These genes showed an enrichment with abnormal long bone morphology in mouse and BMI in human. We computed the heritability of each one of these genes for BMI and height in human using the UK Biobank data (~130,000 individuals genotyped). The results reveal novel genes explaining a high percentage of the total heritability for BMI or height, and some of them with pleiotropic effects. In conclusion, results indicate that directional selection drives correlated changes at the RNA level. It implies that transcriptâ€™s expression can be a good predictor of the phenotypes. Moreover, the results of this study support the idea of genome functional conservation between mammals. It makes divergent selection experiments a powerful tool for unravelling the genetic regulation of complex traits.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Noelia IbÃ¡Ã±ez-Escriche"", ids = ""1412690571""); list(name = ""Ian J.

We apply this separate class approach to true discovery rate degree of association (TDRDA) set analysis, which is used in clinical-genomic studies to identify sets of biomarkers having strong association with clinical outcome or state while controlling the FDR.

e67bccacc04a883170bfe9e038e7938445d1d084,A Mixture Model to Detect Edges in Sparse Co-expression Graphs,"In the early days of microarray data, the medical and statistical communities focused on gene-level data, and particularly on finding differentially expressed genes. This usually involved making a simplifying assumption that genes are independent, which made likelihood derivations feasible and allowed for relatively simple implementations. However, this is not a realistic assumption, and in recent years the scope has expanded, and has come to include pathway and 'gene set' analysis in an attempt to understand the relationships between genes. In this paper we develop a method to recover a gene network's structure from co-expression data, which we measure in terms of normalized Pearson's correlation coefficients between gene pairs. We treat these co-expression measurements as weights in the complete graph in which nodes correspond to genes. We assume that the network is sparse and that only a small fraction of the putative edges are included (`non-null' edges). To decide which edges exist in the gene network, we fit three-component mixture model such that the observed weights of `null edges' follow a normal distribution with mean 0, and the non-null edges follow a mixture of two log-normal distributions, one for positively- and one for negatively-correlated pairs. We show that this so-called $L_2N$ mixture model outperforms other methods in terms of power to detect edges. We also show that using the $L_2N$ model allows for the control of the false discovery rate. Importantly, the method makes no assumptions about the true network structure.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Haim Bar"", ids = ""145204421""); list(name = ""Seo-Jin Bang"", ids = ""51919960"")",,2688d0bfc599cd29b1abf7174b67a4894902abfb; 0acc508d0066a2eb16feefed6f9a8ffa0bb5227f; 8841dba0d37db1f459696fac7decc28953fdc429; 17d072e691554800570bfc9e571158c5fe8049a7; 44ae92d5ff0fc3b00b3e2eba5282cd4cbca8ed76; 2316e9d3e6fb7cfe0554ca365db7a38b0cfbb90c; 5006e66095e3a42634e5ee4de59f10220c204778; c6f4ad8d7ba6f9e28fac31280ce34f2c236421c0; 1dad60e57ae2c3cf9e23402872f5421628aa6def; 9533a5732e570bf1d614b74d2b479443af1d167c; f399b5e8e147a77c1bd583b065ada58502ad5998; 279c7d0f8cce4f71a6e15b847e249d583160d7f2; e50573b554cfa9ee77dcc2e298d7073a152b7199; 5e49e7a0a6c6d46a368a4c036bc9e89a0ac4edd5; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 4a20823dd4ce6003e31f7d4e0649fe8c719926f2; 133e1c15ecf6bf3374d58bef2fc3a425d76eb03c; 88c16d834b68de0fef473b9481c76dbb8850ed5e; cb3efcd5de509f156420976977187a6311d12b6c; 43df40940722c09a776248ab4a090774dd29b704; 60f4b93e55175c36c9f61dc6afbeb2c41c33c9b7; ea6702be4e911d2dc6ce7b0e759a598bd23fe935; 8bdfefc4d88f48e99e108a9b3185fbec1a5b1e8e; 9e8d3337e3aa9686b2f70d9db0b4bb9eb6f9d9b1; eba49f4e6256f44fb6a2fab5ee95519e9a9fb49f; 05ab43b91321e8cf57a42614dd630baecd110bd0; 20ee888ca9c3bae784f266405b4d6395c6f32955; 8ae78abc2ad2580aca3c48f65e6659d3dc36bbe6; 099ec8ae8716c061a0cf0a8568a7721d5d3313bd; 6ef103e8211866d6e7ef3b0b947384a0ac3c5d1b; 44b1041b0fda7e7b7d8b084877a10a37bdec6e98; 00ae5e12df354c4c70b7d51863c6f9f15e44a46a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b3e1705716a12a2cea281dbd4bab6aa13b6d8b87; d2860a370a0386c57fecc4eef2e43779352fa410; e3f335cf508f501b0e9c382ae3c445b29f34a58d; e5293af895b999093e801ed1439a06d5be1f29c9; 18867ef6b426e2d9c68cade3aa387948056141ba; 7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263; f9c33103f9ab0b0cb76c23b7fc82b9fa366b3b16; bdfb57141b2141095ed942b28be24808aeba8d54; c0f451d59cbe22e4caf0dce2868c707417759f25; a33bbacc55b69adf894bbb1b423b9b4c5b031ae0; 251e40a3502ff24f7b1ccdba4d8e50f7b3472727,arXiv: Applications,,

Brain Metabolites and the Relation with Cognition and Psychotic Symptoms in Medication-free Psychosis and Controls: a Pharmacological Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Study,"s for the Sixth Biennial SIRS Conference Poster Session III S391 targeting mitochondrial 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) to determine microglial activation and a T1 MRI scan to study structural brain characteristics including brain volume, cortical thickness, and hippocampal shape. Results: Using a vertex-wise analysis, we observed a significant microglial activation-by-diagnostic group interaction in morphological measures across the left hippocampus. We observed associations between microglial activation and outward and inward morphological alterations in the dorsal and ventro-medial portions of the left hippocampus, respectively. These associations were only observed in first-episode psychosis group. There was no association between [18F]FEPPA binding and other structural brain characteristics. Discussion: Our results, for the first time, suggest a connection between microglial activation and morphological alterations in hippocampus of first-episode psychosis. S170. AMYGDALA SUBNUCLEI VOLUMES IN FIRST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS: ASSOCIATION WITH CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY Reetta-Liina Armio*,1, Heikki Laurikainen1, Raimo Salokangas1, Lauri Tuominen2, Jarmo Hietala1 1University of Turku; 2Harvard University, University of Turku Background: The amygdala volume is reduced already in the first episode of psychosis. The amygdala is a key region in emotional processing, and its volume reduction has been associated with severity of childhood adversity in psychotic patients. Since the amygdala is comprised of separate subnuclei with distinct anatomy and function we wanted to study whether these effects are present in some subnuclei more than others in first episode of psychosis. Methods: We studied amygdala subnuclei volumes in 68 first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients (mean age = 27.1 Â± 6.2, 35 females) and 65 healthy controls (mean 28.9 Â± 6.5, 33 females) randomly selected from the general population. Subjects underwent a T1-weighted MRI with 1mm isotropic resolution (Philips Ingenuity 3T). The subnuclei volumes were generated with a new automated algorithm in FreeSurfer. Childhood adversity was measured using the Trauma and Distress Scale Scores (TADS). Baseline group differences in the amygdala subnuclei volumes were tested using repeated measures general linear model. The analyses were restricted to the four largest subnuclei: the lateral, basal, accessory basal, and the corticoamygdaloid transition area with volumes > 100 mm3. There were no differences between hemispheres nor group by hemisphere interactions so left and right hemispheres were averaged. All group comparisons were corrected for age, sex, and total intracranial volume. Association between the volumes and the TADS scores in the FEP group were also corrected for cumulative exposure to antipsychotic medication. Results: We found that amygdala subnuclei were smaller in the FEP patients than in the the controls with regional specifity (subnucleus ROI*Group p  =  0.015). In the FEP, the most robust reductions were in the lateral nucleus (Bonferroni corrected p = 0.036, Î² = -64.15). No statistically significant difference was observed in the basal nucleus, the accessory basal nucleus or the corticoamygdaloid transition area. The FEP patients had in average higher TADS total score (19.00 Â± 13.56) compared to the HC (7.68 Â± 7.07) (p < 0.001, t = 5.84). We found that particularly the TADS physical abuse score (FEP(n)=63, HC(n)=59) associated significantly differently with some subnuclei in patients and control group (ROI*Group*Physical abuse p  =  0.016). The difference was significant only in the lateral nucleus (Group*Physical abuse p = 0.048, Î² = -34.97). However, there was an overall nonsignificant trend of the negative association between lateral nucleus volume and all TADS scores in the FEP. Similar trend was not seen in the controls. Discussion: We show that the amygdala subnuclei are differently affected already in the first episode of psychosis. Compared to the controls, the FEP patients had smaller lateral nucleus volume, but not basal, accessory basal nucleus or corticoamygdaloid transition area. The lateral nucleus volume was also negatively associated with childhood traumatic experiences, particularly physical abuse in the FEP patients. These findings suggest the involvement of the lateral nucleus of amygdala in the association between childhood traumatic experiences and psychotic disorders. This is well in agreement with studies suggesting that the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is associated with fear learning, recovery from fear and regulation of fear expression. S171. ALTERED WHITE MATTER CONNECTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA USING PUBLIC NEUROIMAGING DATA FROM SCHIZCONNECT Sung Woo Joo1, Woon Yoon2, Seung-Hyun Shon2, Saetbyeol Chat2, JungSun Lee*,3 1University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center; 2Asan Medical Center; 3University of Ulsan College of Medicine Background: Several studies have produced a large body of evidence for white matter abnormalities related to schizophrenia. The literature has yet to achieve a state of consistency and reproducibility, and reported low integrity of white matter tracts vary between studies. Whole brain image study with large sample size is needed to address this issue. We investigated white matter integrity in connections between regions of interests (ROI) in the same hemisphere in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls with public neuroimaging data from SchizConnect (http://schizconnect. org). Methods: A final data set was consisted of 129 healthy controls and 122 schizophrenia patients. For each diffusion weighted image (DWI), a twotensor full-brain tractography was performed, and DWI images were parcellated by processing and registering the T1 images with FreeSurfer and the Advanced Normalization Tools. We extracted a total of 36 tracts in the both hemisphere connecting ROIs in the same hemisphere with white matter query language. We compared means of diffusion measures between patients and controls, and evaluated correlations with Letter-number sequencing (LNS) test, Vocabulary test, letter fluency test, category fluency test, and trails A of the Trail Making Test (TMT). The BenjaminiHochberg procedure with false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Results: We found a significant RD and TR increase of the left thalamooccipital tracts and the right uncinate fascicle (UF), and a significant RD increase of the right middle longitudinal fascicle (MDLF), and the right superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF) ii in schizophrenia. There were correlations between the TR in the left thalamo-occipital tracts and letter fluency test, and the RD in the right SLF ii and LNS test, which did not survive after correction for multiple comparisons. Discussion: These results indicate widespread abnormalities of white matter fiber tracts in schizophrenia, contributing to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. S172.

8565434ffd3f158e8e921f978140f0d5dd8a362c,Are neutral loss and internal product ions useful for top-down protein identification?,"Neutral loss and internal product ions have been found to be significant in both peptide and protein tandem mass spectra and they have been proposed to be included in database search and for protein identification. In addition to common canonical b/y ions in collision-based dissociation or c/z ions in electron-based dissociation, inclusion of neutral loss and internal product ions would certainly make better use of tandem mass spectra data; however, their ultimate utility for protein identification with false discovery rate control remains unclear. Here we report our proteome-level utility benchmarking of neutral loss and internal product ions with tandem mass spectra of intact E. coli proteome. Utility of internal product ions was further evaluated at the protein level using selected tandem mass spectra of individual E. coli proteins. We found that both neutral loss and internal products ions do not have direct utility for protein identification when they were used for scoring of P Score; but they do have indirect utility for provision of more canonical b/y ions when they are included in the database search and overlapping ions between different ion types are resolved.


BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Tandem mass spectrometry has evolved to be a state-of-the-art method for characterization of protein primary structures (including amino acid sequence, post-translational modifications (PTMs) as well as their site location), where full study and utilization tandem mass spectra and product ions are indispensable. This primary structure information is essential for higher order structure and eventual function study of proteins.",2017,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kaijie Xiao"", ids = ""3134673""); list(name = ""Fan Yu"", ids = ""144826789""); list(name = ""Houqin Fang"", ids = ""34426382""); list(name = ""Bingbing Xue"", ids = ""49139260""); list(name = ""Yan Liu"", ids = ""39259224""); list(name = ""Yun-hui Li"", ids = ""7137925""); list(name = ""Zhixin Tian"", ids = ""2678586"")",1bcf0761d86e0f2750cbf370498f9f56575c0e70; e26a324c32b099f5e32a041582d9eca98d471c23; 03cbdf0fe630948eaee57be1d5b9e725aafac545; ffdc2080083014589c324a999e4520d0a44d3046,6b405f3e8cfb778869f3fa524988e6385cb62888; 538b8f0868b487d6821317fb0346bcaccce03a1a; 32ac7b33f8f9f7c4110c61a04f8c58aeff0e3b05; 7e0602850317dbb18c888fb903dd4009b53c839f; bcf2e534740a0fd2aa2b719c8be8ae0fa6f73995; 447f6ad287d7016f76318dfcd3e8b4729b1753f9; 35d8c1ae056a7225708d4d7bbf0bb049ec89893e; d414211ca70ee9c1d8a3d9fadff3d0cb5c44e49b; 9b383c168157601a41037737169d736b2b75608c; b243eec56e112061ed47a2384079e5ae22aa979f; dd402c88ca4ea978414271ac8e1012891916e809; 4a3946e40c85ce61f6a3f2061e5e6bfcdaf7c3c5; 373ae0b6122c64e2f2f87844db5721f5cc21829c; f3d4f9f2ff4f5fc57cff0cd9304464df3e0799df; cc641fbd2bd4af76aac3f53444fe02a739fd485b; 0283c1dc41ffa3ad88db5c4b4ab25613cd096e3c; 6fb551a020a17a97b04bc56b45ce0074b43a1d83; 41688b2c02d992964f10dd778ab2fa6eb3994f4d; 91c95a277779f5e38199b7491f23f7406b015eb9; 1d4f4ad098ba2def03ba89f4acf2ce344981b9f4; 24cb2d585aca01c9de121a6e59164b0617f1b629; 4bcc5dae4e63b7b1ef09088a573f03e72a32eb87; 5094369b0af9ce4ed7d2cfe6644fa64a8852cad4; 77daf769834cc2c871c458b8f6c9245c329ab2b0; f25b4220b47f9570fa6e773920d4e3f579faff16; b6b081fd9c06f233c44e93185363ff3ee2aede68; 4154e1045400f8109bfd8e3af9eb8e6853828df8; 46b9fcec421a102439323358ef193f7b40f19283; 0810c4324e81973a93b09c3cb1f1f2467cca72f0; 8cfdbb1dcf444481bd129ac3e4dc42b8742e68b7; d921b7697501463b24e44fe348ed0cfae30894cf; fb5ed09b82ed34291b56046a6f334dcbcd215b92; 7cd4bafa51b93685560e66d9f60155112df115db,Journal of proteomics,160,"

b5185cde61c16f11467f1f34bfc88bf0f835eb00,"On Comparison of SimTandem with State-of-the-Art Peptide Identification Tools, Efficiency of Precursor Mass Filter and Dealing with Variable Modifications","The similarity search in theoretical mass spectra generated from protein sequence databases is a widely accepted approach for identification of peptides from query mass spectra produced by shotgun proteomics. Growing protein sequence databases and noisy query spectra demand database indexing techniques and better similarity measures for the comparison of theoretical spectra against query spectra. We employ a modification of previously proposed parameterized Hausdorff distance for comparisons of mass spectra. The new distance outperforms the original distance, the angle distance and state-of-the-art peptide identification tools OMSSA and X!Tandem in the number of identified peptides even though the q-value is only 0.001. When a precursor mass filter is used as a database indexing technique, our method outperforms OMSSA in the speed of search. When variable modifications are not searched, the search time is similar to X!Tandem. We show that the precursor mass filter is an efficient database indexing technique for high-accuracy data even though many variable modifications are being searched. We demonstrate that the number of identified peptides is bigger when variable modifications are searched separately by more search runs of a peptide identification engine. Otherwise, the false discovery rates are affected by mixing unmodified and modified spectra together resulting in a lower number of identified peptides. Our method is implemented in the freely available application SimTandem which can be used in the framework TOPP based on OpenMS.",2013,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jiri NovÃ¡k"", ids = ""101609548""); list(name = ""Timo Sachsenberg"", ids = ""2911364""); list(name = ""David Hoksza"", ids = ""1687972""); list(name = ""TomÃ¡s Skopal"", ids = ""1723787""); list(name = ""Oliver Kohlbacher"", ids = ""143998072"")",c590c08358d232186fb2483c1cd961ea5ee07b0a,07daee8d7a9dc6a3312594ff610d22885d12672f; d9970b7eb0ed2c38ea7d00a3937d59075e41cd88; ad329214db010eb839b2dcb3722b72be1e9228d1; 6544a071b7896f654d38d9b7b3e5404436c34f60; 0f5751f76cef4a502b22ad088c381a4d0bb10121; 0bb96d515f5ed4a3082e85a993e072794e22ad0b; d4d64236738c2f3b49272c2e2ff7e3e753e9b081; 9300a6b077ebf54d5284f4e7e02bfd4c49d11e24; 983da7ea06c1c52c458d3756a729fb21f1614aeb; f09d4a533a221b9b85c591ba1dc862dd2fe808a1; fa39fb914d6c8eea01ef04ae5953e170010928fa; 515b21be02a525b8364a2ec438ad30f903e62dbc; 8fb8f311fdd9365f79bc95ecf5ffa576096cde44; 1b03414ebace3aae831362dc3ab07619e1ecb36f; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 103c79973c95b14ae95a78469bbe286216ae7d8b; 97a91ce5d303225b87aa2ee3b7c281fb40c69ef5; 631fe3da480f8d903f574cfb89f6d06c1cef6947; 24384799d967935be1e23fd10bc42635e16b287e; b044a2a8a40327a7a5f6c125fbd20565e980ac1c; 0a0d0591d08fb76bc511223c639846c5a8f9d5a5; 705368a810dce493720a0c1a529e9bba2237e78c; 84f1ae09777b36aba9b6b01cb6d527022840c6c8; 2b88df7c6c847c19acde4dd6d82fb3eb2dcde567; daacfe9c90486e5094de64331e0a2052fb5dd30e; ed17502f0fb3a331d8a33d184c18ca5602f4a94d; 6d9089204167f6ea32d81de6796ea6ac17c607d8; 1ef83b2b980b406db708adb6104533be05af9854; ca1ed8fd9ba9683108d7cf61ef31aff50b2eb293; 298d870d34ffe614b7d1ed4e5782701e38bf6d0f; 5ff7780391ad63c3e3b3965c7fcde056cf8c38dd; de12682f3e96c400a0b5262e581734ccf7ef8bb2; 0d1f749dfc04023f8cc0acb91c2d2b19ea99e034; 10374f736a7d745f02cfbb56581a62913c38e874; 226f0be6d66a6b12c629e835fc366cdad4dc4ff7; b02583325ca64903c4328ecc688bcb4cc3131a94,Journal of integrative bioinformatics,10 3,"

Therapy â€˜respondersâ€™ had >50% reduction in leaks on 3day bladder diary. A priori selected regions of interest (ROIs) were: right insula, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area (dACC/SMA). Generalized psycho-physiological interaction (gPPI) was used to calculate â€˜effective connectivityâ€™ between ROIs during urgency at low and high bladder volume conducted using our urge provocation task using small bolus infusion and withdrawal of fluid [1]. We conducted a one-way ANOVA pre-treatment on groups (continent vs responders vs non-responders) and a two-way mixed ANOVA (responders vs non-responders and prevs posttherapy) using false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Principal component analysis was used to assess origins of connections within our chosen 18mm radius spherical ROIs.

The traditional SNP-wise approach along with multiple testing adjustment is over-conservative and lack of power in many GWASs. In this article, we proposed a model-based clustering method that transforms the challenging high-dimension-small-sample-size problem to low-dimension-large-sample-size problem and borrows information across SNPs by grouping SNPs into three clusters. We pre-specify the patterns of clusters by minor allele frequencies of SNPs between cases and controls, and enforce the patterns with prior distributions. In the simulation studies our proposed novel model outperforms traditional SNP-wise approach by showing better controls of false discovery rate (FDR) and higher sensitivity. We re-analyzed two real studies to identifying SNPs associated with severe bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BiPN) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). The original analysis in the literature failed to identify SNPs after FDR adjustment. Our proposed method not only detected the reported SNPs after FDR adjustment but also discovered a novel BiPN-associated SNP rs4351714 that has been reported to be related to MM in another study.",2019,Biology; Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yan Xu"", ids = ""38758850""); list(name = ""Li Xing"", ids = ""80514110""); list(name = ""Jessica Su"", ids = ""145531163""); list(name = ""Xuekui Zhang"", ids = ""8443431""); list(name = ""Weiliang Qiu"", ids = ""145348216"")",,e70ba61fab6dfbc4506fc86ed19698cfd9db9384; ade6b20c913ac8de061862a50c257c05d46a5a30; 65fc43a29d45411d7f056fcdf981de618934615b; 9b906348aac7416ead8fecc9816f345ec784e3fd; d09596ff88121fe53e741271d528e3e6638d8b8e; 42a05722ecbd5e71ac5879f50eaf1dcd1fc17e28; 650c8a5467a697b6d09cf9a3f6b10f5c7dde0fa4; 363d035e3d42cf0955ce61f9d4e2917138623fbd; 1d6bcbab8e6ab351c4aaee6c695729b6fbeca4cb; e1c5eadcd3f75402882b3ca768d039407b94ebbb; e429232a84d9a23194ae4cc5addb84d02aaef9a4; 869e99037469fa9caa7b62e913b689812e6767e5; 8b9182ac171758ef7d78371fb26aa1c9995c72d2; ccbf117ee7982df2f4f491c753878e121708e099; f929f5f354a4597cd4f888684f45ed60bb9efc2d; 4d65e9ceb2981fc081f42544b5110ccd07d28976; 769b70e74fd8890042841f00f39e7b982aa3193e; 817fc8de25f989b8229847fc7710750f273460b6; 2e3f1d72381d8c864bd15a1935016231a65fea32; 121f20e36e9dbf731c69a6c32ae70fc128a60a0d; aa1baaabe9c0771b0caa101badadf5afcccdec7f; 52d7e1fc2015f980c9ed4c89dc46b971eeb41386; 000551662c3902ed66709be879053d95dafc0211; 6241d9ac2a24852e592a63cc7023017ffe73390c; 0f36625ca99359b96d6736a0027c5244f4484f5c; eee4297075345938904bc5a07b933e6acc4058dc; 3f95be7aed26568594c2929fc6ce10144d52944c; b9109b886d2edd2baf1312e6197bb1d5be82cd1e; 91983b12c9e66a07a8f87105238a866ea7b9c0b4; aae178412932e339ce3069a00bc6b35c725d2e48; 4ac24482fee0652d3d83ca8a30477004a3d180df; 90532137443ef9ef6c94459377b84715f10dd5a7; dad9c67ea428059e1265573ce89360dcd148ff65; 3dc83181da78815bb6a597b2e4e7351817e51b25; 5a1f87f9c66d28b97cfe8ef2187f79dd4b0a33fd; 9da7de1215196ba0a697392a4299418bd688b9a7; d39dc7ef80da0c4e82d8cb0166055a099ddbc92e; 571c3ea8cabd16ab0ae7a1a3495d3f3aca918e23; 67f0c08c3feda466de28a74f68ac5bf6600fd039; 947feba9136e877f50968b62fd2e6c6381376580; b78489bd096b79cb1dac1d0474386e9d563c32b0; 74e63212a0fb574b50b21cc023b137d7b679e42f; 90947c64553041bb83ce5fd97e7782a75ce77d25; 1a5af849470fc77578847c64d8087e25c5062c07; d6aca0130ffef627f853fcc4ad5377e4ad930192,Scientific Reports,9,
e50ed1451a7e4843bb5f52f566fb6a56d7042c02,A Family Based Study of Carbon Monoxide and Nitric Oxide Signalling Genes and Preeclampsia,"BACKGROUND
Preeclampsia is thought to originate during placentation, with incomplete remodelling and perfusion of the spiral arteries leading to reduced placental vascular capacity. Nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) are powerful vasodilators that play a role in the placental vascular system. Although family clustering of preeclampsia has been observed, the existing genetic literature is limited by a failure to consider both mother and child.


METHODS
We conducted a nested case-control study within the Norwegian Mother and Child Birth Cohort of 1545 case-pairs and 995 control-pairs from 2540 validated dyads (2011 complete pairs, 529 missing mother or child genotype). We selected 1518 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequency >5% in NO and CO signalling pathways. We used log-linear Poisson regression models and likelihood ratio tests to assess maternal and child effects.


RESULTS
One SNP met criteria for a false discovery rate Q-value <0.05. The child variant, rs12547243 in adenylate cyclase 8 (ADCY8), was associated with an increased risk (relative risk [RR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20, 1.69 for AG vs. GG, RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.47, 3.11 for AA vs. GG, Q = 0.03). The maternal variant, rs30593 in PDE1C was associated with a decreased risk for the subtype of preeclampsia accompanied by early delivery (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27, 0.75 for TC vs. CC; Q = 0.02). None of the associations were replicated after correction for multiple testing.


CONCLUSIONS
This study uses a novel approach to disentangle maternal and child genotypic effects of NO and CO signalling genes on preeclampsia.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Anna E Bauer"", ids = ""49905095""); list(name = ""Christy L Avery"", ids = ""4344453""); list(name = ""Min Shi"", ids = ""143931951""); list(name = ""Clarice R.

3e1d45d4bf344b254dfa8b150aeddf35d8d0592f,Gene expression profiling of advanced ovarian cancers to predict the outcome of primary surgical cytoreduction.,"5000 Background: The benefit of optimal surgical cytoreduction for patients with advanced ovarian cancer is well established. Whether an optimal surgical cytoreductive procedure is dependent upon the skill of the operating surgeon or the underlying tumor biology is unknown. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that gene expression profiles of advanced ovarian cancers differ between patients who are able to undergo optimal versus suboptimal surgical cytoreduction.


METHODS
Fresh frozen tumor tissues were collected at the time of initial surgery from patients with stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Gene expression profiles were generated from total RNA using the Affymetrix U133A oligonucleotide microarray containing over 22,000 probe sets. A supervised class comparison, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 10%, was performed to determine if there were differentially expressed genes between tumors from 45 optimal and 25 suboptimal patients. A global test was utilized to examine whether there was an overall difference in gene expression between the two groups. The k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) method was used to determine if group membership could be predicted from the array data.


RESULTS
The mean age of the entire study group was 62Â±11 years. The stage of disease was as follows: IIIB, 7%; IIIC, 71%; IV, 21%. With the FDR set at 10%, there were no differentially expressed genes between the optimally and suboptimally cytoreduced patients. The global test did not reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the two groups (p = .09). The predictions from the KNN method were no better than random.


CONCLUSIONS
The data suggest that gene expression profiles are not able to predict the outcome of surgical cytoreduction. The findings indicate that maximal surgical effort may have a greater role than tumor biology in achieving optimal cytoreduction of advanced ovarian cancer. This conclusion is supported by data from our institution demonstrating that the optimal cytoreduction rate has increased by more than 50% in the past five years during which time the underlying tumor biology has most likely not changed.

Investigation of microbe-metabolite relationships in the gut is needed to understand and potentially reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) risk.


METHODS
Microbiota and metabolomics profiling were performed on lyophilized feces from 42 CRC cases and 89 matched controls. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify statistically independent associations with CRC. First principal coordinate-component pair (PCo1-PC1) and false discovery rate (0.05)-corrected P-values were calculated for 116,000 Pearson correlations between 530 metabolites and 220 microbes in a sex*case/control meta-analysis.


RESULTS
Overall microbe-metabolite PCo1-PC1 was more strongly correlated in cases than in controls (Rho 0.606 vs 0.201, P = 0.01). CRC was independently associated with lower levels of Clostridia, Lachnospiraceae, p-aminobenzoate and conjugated linoleate, and with higher levels of Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, p-hydroxy-benzaldehyde, and palmitoyl-sphingomyelin. Through postulated effects on cell shedding (palmitoyl-sphingomyelin), inflammation (conjugated linoleate), and innate immunity (p-aminobenzoate), metabolites mediated the CRC association with Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas by 29% and 34%, respectively. Overall, palmitoyl-sphingomyelin correlated directly with abundances of Enterobacteriaceae (Gammaproteobacteria), three Actinobacteria and five Firmicutes. Only Parabacteroides correlated inversely with palmitoyl-sphingomyelin. Other lipids correlated inversely with Alcaligenaceae (Betaproteobacteria). Six Bonferroni-significant correlations were found, including low indolepropionate and threnoylvaline with Actinobacteria and high erythronate and an uncharacterized metabolite with Enterobacteriaceae.


CONCLUSIONS
Feces from CRC cases had very strong microbe-metabolite correlations that were predominated by Enterobacteriaceae and Actinobacteria. Metabolites mediated a direct CRC association with Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas, but not an inverse association with Clostridia and Lachnospiraceae. This study identifies complex microbe-metabolite networks that may provide insights on neoplasia and targets for intervention.",2016,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Rashmi Sinha"", ids = ""40348294""); list(name = ""Jiyoung Ahn"", ids = ""8527795""); list(name = ""Joshua N.

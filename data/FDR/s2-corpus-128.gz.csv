626417c30bad58e1e455ec09d85bb8adcd583282,Gut Microbial Protein Expression in Response to Dietary Patterns in a Controlled Feeding Study: A Metaproteomic Approach,"Although the gut microbiome has been associated with dietary patterns linked to health, microbial metabolism is not well characterized. This ancillary study was a proof of principle analysis for a novel application of metaproteomics to study microbial protein expression in a controlled dietary intervention. We measured the response of the microbiome to diet in a randomized crossover dietary intervention of a whole-grain, low glycemic load diet (WG) and a refined-grain, high glycemic load diet (RG). Total proteins in stools from 9 participants at the end of each diet period (n = 18) were analyzed by LC MS/MS and proteins were identified using the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) human gut microbiome database and UniProt human protein databases. T-tests, controlling for false discovery rate (FDR) <10%, were used to compare the Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes and bacterial enzymes between the two interventions. Using shotgun proteomics, more than 53,000 unique peptides were identified including microbial (89%) and human peptides (11%). Forty-eight bacterial enzymes were statistically different between the diets, including those implicated in SCFA production and degradation of fatty acids. Enzymes associated with degradation of human mucin were significantly enriched in the RG diet. These results illustrate that the metaproteomic approach is a valuable tool to study the microbial metabolism of diets that may influence host health.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sheng Pan"", ids = ""144994373""); list(name = ""Meredith A J Hullar"", ids = ""5232531""); list(name = ""Lisa A.

0c0777b66ccb3406f74b80b07cb5bb144d360b89,Variable DNA methylation of aging-related genes is associated with male COPD,"BackgroundChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung inflammatory disease which has a close relationship with aging. Genome-wide analysis reveals that DNA methylation markers vary obviously with age. DNA methylation variations in peripheral blood have the potential to be biomarkers for COPD. However, the specific DNA methylation of aging-related genes in the peripheral blood of COPD patients remains largely unknown.MethodsFirstly, 9 aging-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in COPD patients were screened out from the 25 aging-related genes profile through a comprehensive screening strategy. Secondly, qPCR and multiple targeted bisulfite enrichment sequencing (MethTarget) were used to detect the mRNA level and DNA methylation level of the 9 differentially expressed genes in the peripheral blood of 60 control subjects and 45 COPD patients. The candidate functional CpG sites were selected on the basis of the regulation ability of the target gene expression. Thirdly, the correlation was evaluated between the DNA methylation level of the key CpG sites and the clinical parameters of COPD patients, including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced expiratory volume in one second as percentage of predicted volume (FEV1%), forced expiratory volume/ forced vital capacity (FEV/FVC), modified British medical research council (mMRC) score, acute exacerbation frequency and the situation of frequent of acute aggravation (CAT) score. Lastly, differentially methylated CpG sites unrelated to smoking were also determined in COPD patients.ResultsOf the 9 differentially expressed aging-related genes, the mRNA expression of 8 genes were detected to be significantly down-regulated in COPD group, compared with control group. Meanwhile, the methylated level of all aging-related genes was changed in COPD group containing 219 COPD-related CpG sites in total. Notably, 27 CpG sites of FOXO3 gene showed a lower False Discovery Rate (FDR) and higher methylation difference values. Also, some variable DNA methylation is associated with the severity of COPD. Additionally, of the 219 COPD-related CpG sites, 147 CpG sites were not related to smoking.ConclusionThese results identified that the mRNA expression and DNA methylation level of aging-related genes were changed in male COPD patients, which provides a molecular link between aging and COPD. The identified CpG markers are associated with the severity of COPD and provide new insights into the prediction and identification of COPD.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xizi Du"", ids = ""51244051""); list(name = ""Lin Yuan"", ids = ""46762835""); list(name = ""Meng-ping Wu"", ids = ""153138862""); list(name = ""Meichao Men"", ids = ""36757380""); list(name = ""Ruoxi He"", ids = ""10794437""); list(name = ""Leyuan Wang"", ids = ""49680712""); list(name = ""Shuang-Yan Wu"", ids = ""15921152""); list(name = ""Yang Xiang"", ids = ""145337332""); list(name = ""Xiangping Qu"", ids = ""50123937""); list(name = ""Huijun Liu"", ids = ""49958125""); list(name = ""Xiaoqun Qin"", ids = ""123814471""); list(name = ""Cheng-ping Hu"", ids = ""144657223""); list(name = ""Ling Qin"", ids = ""12764978""); list(name = ""Chi Liu"", ids = ""153903879"")",,a9a5ed40f71884a607289787a4ee1e5167357a4c; 497fa3d15b67ef242188db42e68829882030a274; 1b63a01c955b02c29e3f6d973954bc73a9d17d1b; 96b4d113ce2917a6ba0e879df36fbb57077d3a24; 92bca2646ae76b9c7f9d44a936c13a68c326b141; 6a0a7e888d08c2d571444a14f7d906dcdbe57b07; 56dbcbe8246ef8937216c9b51e75fd536e2cad80; 8e35f001f5f4819aba33df27589075dd8b0ec6a9; e87d73890de765ce3c627f2ef16f9f4363f87108; 249b2302edd1dce346e6dca8a316499e9a4dbeaf; e91c1b15255e5e8c394823c8f614c5f9260cd2f9; 71a43920dde2692f377b00f69d6ca95459ca35c3; fa41e25bc8755440d71ca5df5ff7160bc8d6efa4; 09a90c3f68208762735cfd8bb27663b156c19f54; 75817649044862cc24444b38f9301f7e69384d6b; e8e1914132055d055ff240f337ec70ec11077766; 4c99cf976e3a1abcfbcb3a2ddf1c3208c0d5bc5d; e0cac0f807424a299f906e4d0a777a9eb040e9ba; 0a7ddc8ba19609beb97603985648f699eb3fc721; a095a0ad8bfd11e00450d3cab10af04c2182a092; 9f89158ac85c95e077449ec78062bfd7f355eae0; 30cd096756b07d49e0f1edb3815f943662dc713b; 849851f54cf3bc9bb02a8361f054915ebc23c54b; 3bc6a8d8feba2d7fd42bba4cf5998ce30f5d177c; c3227f1144bac31857526266e63b240288e9f264; 1aa11a205693761db4964cd2bfae382c704e588c; e7471672def5803e75f4346a23d4df8d6eba7314; 56420262da5403fe440e365e0cc2a7a91aed150d; 7a2d00d2c159061165c8b17c5a2407438824ba47; d888e90019d4a9beff027f9621546551c08270ae; 5d117cfd6a75e5d140be34f6d02ecf456d5e2895; 4df8c0fcc775b08f23d061903b4290cb5b65ccaa; b6cdaa72aebf57395a0f3beb2f5b3087b0ccfbb6; a3b09e1d81990574e73a74c82f592f025b56ff2c; b19d7b87da9503b9fb8bed6eeb47f5de52d29e7a; 5365dda677846489c7c418073996445c0aff1c9a; 62500ca5a621038347ab3d77ea65467c1e0717fe; 0f6e835032e3772734602ced01ee15b919bae54c; e77f109eb505830d48fa5669723cbce2c32791a5; 415fffa381f45002b61307064bd8c3f7969624df; a6322c4a3a1725ec37b8e0b7f81a2e28d6ca3c8c; 51ba5018727e674821fb57da0cef9c8598e47690; 1a2c5ec39b425dae2efe39b63ec0570621d26d88; 23701607933e0322c5d893a0da4d56311186798b; d8c08ddc7a5fc52dd370c55989107de08ad7225a; ac411ebc014c8fa45dc9f30d5e82cf1a2f79a533; f145196f7761aadce899e15bd426592b92aee9eb; 289207baf875ab35defa92b42d7cdc9ec60c4d64; 791fc6fbfab452f998103fb83cbfa3cf6ae9e50a; 17e72df91f265d92f893bd4dd0737b43759054ce; 0ec1239626059825a6813f5ba7cd1f64357c7352; 03703d53de4a0ef581e1d3916b8f7832763bb23b,Respiratory Research,20,

CRC is associated with aging; however, the incidence of sporadic, early-onset ( Method: RNAseq data from individuals 65 years was performed using edgeR (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/ bioc/html/edgeR.htm). Only genes with at least two counts per million (CPM) in at least 60 samples were further analyzed. False discovery rate (FDR) was set to less than 5% in the analysis. Results: A total of 373 individuals with CRC were available using TCGA data: 60 with early onset ( Conclusion: This is the first characterization of gene expression profiles in early-onset CRC patients included in the TCGA database. The observed differences in gene expression have to be further analyzed in order to gain insight into the molecular pathways leading to sporadic early-onset CRC. Furthermore, a more comprehensive understanding of the biology of sporadic early-onset CRC is needed in order to directly address this emerging public health problem and to subsequently shift current clinical practices for young patients falling outside of current screening guidelines across the cancer continuum, from prevention strategies to screening and/or treatment.

c44334579946547a291165019dd7a948f9dfdff5,Impact of Blood Sugar Control on Metabolites and Carbohydrate Metabolism in Type 1 Diabetes,"In type 1 diabetes (T1D), long-term blood sugar control measured by HbA1c can vary over a wide range. Although metabolites are commonly studied in type 2 diabetes (T2D) as they relate to HbA1c, similar studies in T1D are few. Since the underlying etiologies of T1D and T2D are different, we explored the overall pathways of metabolism in T1D subjects with tight vs. poor blood sugar control. T1D subjects (n=50) were divided into two groups (n=25 each) based on low vs. high HbA1c (Screen 1, low: mean 6.7 Â± 0.1%; high: mean 8.7 Â± 0.3%). Serum samples were analyzed on a metabolomic GC/HPLC/MS platform and analyzed for differences in biochemicals between the groups. The screen was repeated with a second group of 50 patients for verification (Screen 2, mean 6.3 Â± 0.1%; mean 8.0 Â± 0.2%) and then both screens combined. For each detected biochemical, average scaled intensity was determined and statistical significance of differences was calculated using a two-tailed, unpaired Studentâ€™s T test (p-values) and False Discovery Rate (q-values). The platform distinguished 690 components in Screen 1 and 623 biochemicals in Screen 2. In Screen 1, two biochemicals, including glucose, showed significant differences (â‰¦0.05) for both p and q value. In Screen 2, none of the biochemicals reached threshold. When the screens were combined (100 samples), 10 biochemicals were significant for both p and q. Three components (glucose, mannose and 1,5-AG) were carbohydrates related to blood sugar control and thus expected in a high and low HbA1c analysis. Significant biochemicals commonly found in T2D and related to blood sugar control were not significant in T1D for both p and q in the screens. We conclude that few metabolites are correlated in T1D with tight vs. poor blood sugar control compared to T2D. Unlike T2D, metabolites related to intracellular sugar utilization, the Krebs cycle and purine synthesis are unrelated to blood sugar control in T1D cohorts. Disclosure W. Kuhtreiber: None. S.E.

The molecular hallmark of MMR deficiency is microsatellite instability (MSI), which presents as polymorphism of tandem nucleotide repeat lengths ubiquitously distributed throughout the genome. Furthermore, the presence of MMR-deficiency or MSI across solid tumors has been recently demonstrated to be a robust biomarker for immunotherapy response with checkpoint inhibition. We have previously developed technology to detect MSI in tumor tissue through hybrid-capture based targeted next-generation sequencing analyses of a 125 gene panel, with probes capturing mononucleotide repeat markers. Using a set of 32 MSI and 27 microsatellite stable (MSS) formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimens, we obtained 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity with a limit of detection of 20% tumor purity. The clinical importance of MSI status now requires a fast, objective, highly sensitive screening method, particularly in late-stage patients where tumor material may not be readily obtained. However, to extend this approach to a liquid biopsy panel requires technological advances to overcome the inherent challenges associated with low circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels that are compounded by polymerase slippage in mononucleotide repeat regions during PCR amplification. To overcome these limitations, we applied a multifactorial error correction approach together with a novel peak finding algorithm to more accurately identify the specific mononucleotide sequences in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analyses. By eliminating a significant majority of sequencing errors and polymerase slippage artifacts, we were able to reduce background error rates by > 90%. Combined with implementation of a distribution modeling and a peak finding algorithm, we were able to accurately sequence the mononucleotide tracts to minimize false discovery rates for cfDNA analyses. To evaluate the performance of this approach in clinical samples, for a cohort of plasma samples obtained from 13 late-stage clinical cases with matched tumor tissue data available (9 MSI and 4 MSS) together with 66 healthy donor plasma samples, we obtained 89% sensitivity and 100% specificity, with a lowest reported mutant allele fraction of 0.4%. Taken together, this integrated next-generation sequencing liquid biopsy approach is valuable for the determination of MSI status to inform immunotherapy treatment.

cc32591772b8af0c2ca161222506c799165a62ff,Texture Analysis of standard Magnetic Resonance Images to predict Response to Gamma Knife Radio-Surgery in Vestibular Schwannomas.,"PURPOSE
To search for texture features of routine MR Imaging in order to predict tumor volume reduction and transient versus permanent tumor progression of vestibular schwannomas treated by Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Included were 23 patients with vestibular schwannomas treated in our center and followed over a period of 23.7 to 80.3 months (mean 42.7). MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla scanner and included T1w images with and without contrast enhancement, T2w and FLAIR images. Volumetric results were followed longitudinally over time and correlated to texture features as mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of normalized signals taken from regions of interest covering the total tumor volume.


RESULTS
14 tumors showed early progression during the first 5 to 18 months (2 cases permanent, 12 cases transient), whereas 9 tumors regressed immediately after SRS. Kurtosis of T2 weighted image intensity values turned out to predict progression best with a sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 78%. From all texture feature parameters, only the minimum of the normalized T2w image intensity values correlated significantly to the final reduction of tumor volume per month (CC=-0.634, p<0.05, corrected for False Discovery Rate).


CONCLUSION
Texture feature analysis helps to predict permanent versus transient enlargement and final volume reduction of schwannomas after SRS. Thus, alternative treatment strategies might be considered, mainly in large tumors, where further clinical deterioration cannot be excluded. To confirm these results a prospective study including more cases and a longer follow-up period is necessary.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Herwin Speckter"", ids = ""5211095""); list(name = ""JÃºlia Santana"", ids = ""90042527""); list(name = ""JosÃ© Bido"", ids = ""153473325""); list(name = ""Giancarlo Hernandez"", ids = ""153029398""); list(name = ""Diones Rivera"", ids = ""12334302""); list(name = ""L U I S Suazo"", ids = ""1391714356""); list(name = ""Sergio O.

1528de01b1ae8601ab57bd2b2e23f5e622cd8bab,Classifying and characterizing nicotine use disorder with high accuracy using machine learning and resting-state fMRI.,"Cigarette smoking continues to be a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality. Although the majority of smokers report making a quit attempt in the past year, smoking cessation rates remain modest. Thus, developing accurate, data-driven methods that can classify and characterize the neural features of nicotine use disorder (NUD) would be a powerful clinical tool that could aid in optimizing treatment development and guide treatment modifications. This investigation applied support vector machine-based classification to resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) data from individuals diagnosed with NUD (nÂ =Â 108; 63 male) and matched nonsmoking controls (nÂ =Â 108; 63 male) and multi-dimensional scaling to visualize the heterogeneity of NUD in individual smokers based on rsFC measures. Machine-based learning models identified five resting-state networks that played a role in distinguishing smokers from controls: the posterior and anterior default mode networks, the sensorimotor network, the salience network and the right executive control network. The classification method constructed classifiers with an average correct classification rate of 88.1 percent and an average area under the curve of 0.93. Compared with controls, individuals with NUD had weaker functional connectivity measures within these networks (PÂ <Â 0.05, false discovery rate corrected). Further, multi-dimensional scaling visualization demonstrated that controls were similar to each other whereas individuals with NUD had less similarity to controls and to other individuals with NUD. Our findings build upon previous literature demonstrating that machine learning-based approaches to classifying rsFC data offer a valuable technique to understanding network-level differences in nicotine-related neurobiology and extend previous findings by improving classification accuracy and demonstrating the heterogeneity in resting-state networks of individuals with NUD.",2019,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Reagan R.

7a37f36db37f2b64d2a83256fefe763788794624,A Metabolomics Analysis of Body Mass Index and Postmenopausal Breast Cancer Risk,"Background
Elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain elusive.


Methods
In a nested case-control study of 621 postmenopausal breast cancer case participants and 621 matched control participants, we measured 617 metabolites in prediagnostic serum. We calculated partial Pearson correlations between metabolites and BMI, and then evaluated BMI-associated metabolites (Bonferroni-corrected Î± level for 617 statistical tests = P < 8.10â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5) in relation to invasive breast cancer. Odds ratios (ORs) of breast cancer comparing the 90th vs 10th percentile (modeled on a continuous basis) were estimated using conditional logistic regression while controlling for breast cancer risk factors, including BMI. Metabolites with the lowest P values (false discovery rate < 0.2) were mutually adjusted for one another to determine those independently associated with breast cancer risk.


Results
Of 67 BMI-associated metabolites, two were independently associated with invasive breast cancer risk: 16a-hydroxy-DHEA-3-sulfate (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22 to 2.22) and 3-methylglutarylcarnitine (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.67, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.21 to 2.30). Four metabolites were independently associated with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer risk: 16a-hydroxy-DHEA-3-sulfate (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.84, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.27 to 2.67), 3-methylglutarylcarnitine (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.91, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.23 to 2.96), allo-isoleucine (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.76, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.23 to 2.51), and 2-methylbutyrylcarnitine (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.89, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.22 to 2.91). In a model without metabolites, each 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was associated with a 14% higher risk of breast cancer (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.14, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.01 to 1.28), but adding 16a-hydroxy-DHEA-3-sulfate and 3-methylglutarylcarnitine weakened this association (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.06, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.93 to 1.20), with the logOR attenuating by 57.6% (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰21.8% to 100.0+%).


Conclusion
These four metabolites may signal metabolic pathways that contribute to breast carcinogenesis and that underlie the association of BMI with increased postmenopausal breast cancer risk.

1fe61aa8c7c7dbf14a19807677609325f1520156,Latent Gaussian Mixture Models for Nationwide Kidney Transplant Center Evaluation,"Five year post-transplant survival rate is an important indicator on quality of care delivered by kidney transplant centers in the United States. To provide a fair assessment of each transplant center, an effect that represents the center-specific care quality, along with patient level risk factors, is often included in the risk adjustment model. In the past, the center effects have been modeled as either fixed effects or Gaussian random effects, with various pros and cons. Our numerical analyses reveal that the distributional assumptions do impact the prediction of center effects especially when the effect is extreme. To bridge the gap between these two approaches, we propose to model the transplant center effect as a latent random variable with a finite Gaussian mixture distribution. Such latent Gaussian mixture models provide a convenient framework to study the heterogeneity among the transplant centers. To overcome the weak identifiability issues, we propose to estimate the latent Gaussian mixture model using a penalized likelihood approach, and develop sequential locally restricted likelihood ratio tests to determine the number of components in the Gaussian mixture distribution. The fitted mixture model provides a convenient means of controlling the false discovery rate when screening for underperforming or outperforming transplant centers.

312a90f4e054c981487504938c5e74b347a17ec2,Understanding sample size: what determines the required number of microarrays for an experiment?,"DNA microarray experiments have become a widely used tool for studying gene expression. An important, but difficult, part of these experiments is deciding on the appropriate number of biological replicates to use. Often, researchers will want a number of replicates that give sufficient power to recognize regulated genes while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at an acceptable level. Recent advances in statistical methodology can now help to resolve this issue. Before using such methods it is helpful to understand the reasoning behind them. In this Research Focus article we explain, in an intuitive way, the effect sample size has on the FDR and power, and then briefly survey some recently proposed methods in this field of research and provide an example of use.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tommy S.

d26a9f85bf2b4c243ad579f2b563b437a52752f8,Mitochondrial proteomic analysis reveals deficiencies in oxygen utilization in medullary thick ascending limb of Henle in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat.,"The renal medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) of the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat is the site of enhanced NaCl reabsorption and excess superoxide production. In the present studies we isolated mitochondria from mTAL of SS and salt-resistant control strain SS.13(BN) rats on 0.4 and 8% salt diet for 7 days and performed a proteomic analysis. Purity of mTAL and mitochondria isolations exceeded 93.6 and 55%, respectively. Using LC/MS spectral analysis techniques we identified 96 mitochondrial proteins in four biological mTAL mitochondria samples, run in duplicate, as defined by proteins with a false discovery rate <5% and scan count â‰¥2. Seven of these 96 proteins, including IDH2, ACADM, SCOT, Hsp60, ATPA, EFTu, and VDAC2 were differentially expressed between the two rat strains. Oxygen consumption and high-resolution respirometry analyses showed that mTAL cells and the mitochondria in the outer medulla of SS rats fed high-salt diet exhibited lower rates of oxygen utilization compared with those from SS.13(BN) rats. These studies advance the conventional proteomic paradigm of focusing exclusively upon whole tissue homogenates to a focus upon a single cell type and specific subcellular organelle. The results reveal the importance of a largely unexplored role for deficiencies of mTAL mitochondrial metabolism and oxygen utilization in salt-induced hypertension and renal medullary oxidative stress.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Nadezhda N.

af6d32a9d25fbfdbad17f7e82e02288dbb4736a9,lncDIFF: a novel distribution-free method for differential expression analysis of long non-coding RNA,"Motivation Long non-coding RNA expression data has been increasingly used in finding diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in cancer studies. Existing differential analysis tools for RNA sequencing does not effectively accommodate low abundant genes, as commonly observed in lncRNA. We propose a novel and robust statistical method lncDIFF to detect differential expressed (DE) genes without assuming the true density on normalized counts. Results lncDIFF adopts the generalized linear model with zero-inflated exponential quasi likelihood to estimate group effect on normalized counts, and employs the likelihood ratio test to detect differential expressed genes. The proposed method and tool is suitable for data processed with standard RNA-Seq preprocessing and normalization pipelines. Simulation results illustrate that lncDIFF detects DE genes with more power and lower false discovery rate regardless of the data pattern. The analysis on a head and neck squamous cell carcinomas study also confirms that lncDIFF has better sensitivity in identifying novel lncRNA genes with relatively large fold change and prognostic value.

Variations of the microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1) gene, as well as their possible interactions with PAHs exposure, may increase susceptibility to CHDs.This case-control study investigated the risk of CHDs in relation to the EPHX1 polymorphisms and assessed the interactions between these polymorphisms and PAHs exposure in 357 mothers of CHDs fetuses and 270 control mothers. Logistic regression models for the risk of CHDs were applied to determine the effect of genetic polymorphisms using additive, recessive, and dominant genetic models, as well as gene-exposure interactions. Multiple testing was adjusted by applying the false discovery rate (FDR).None of the maternal genetic polymorphisms of EPHX1 was associated with CHDs occurrence. Only the single nucleotide polymorphism rs1051740 was associated with an increased risk of right-sided obstructive malformations under the recessive model (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]â€Š=â€Š1.852, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.065, 3.22) before FDR correction. A possible modifying effect of PAHs exposure on genetic polymorphisms of EPHX1 was found in susceptibility to CHDs, though no multiplicative-scale interactions between maternal exposure to PAHs and polymorphisms of EPHX1 gene were seento affect the risk of CHDs.The role of EPHX1 gene polymorphisms for CHDs need to be further evaluated, in particularly by interacting with PAHs exposure.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jing Tao"", ids = ""144797469""); list(name = ""Nana Li"", ids = ""49088520""); list(name = ""Zhen Liu"", ids = ""50810664""); list(name = ""Ying Deng"", ids = ""143649842""); list(name = ""Xiaohong Li"", ids = ""145935647""); list(name = ""Ming Ya Chen"", ids = ""4707880""); list(name = ""Jing Yu"", ids = ""119883449""); list(name = ""Jun Zhu"", ids = ""145296845""); list(name = ""Ping Yu"", ids = ""145292574""); list(name = ""Yanping Wang"", ids = list())",,c13dd0c06f5e842e51de1d0a93af14d5384fb80e; 9b8d5a0a03d7d5a28d1fd581b9e14e4960a7f1c4; ec339678b1de85bccae644db4fff37c5630c23c9; 9e81a130cb83626e785df5a74ea44dc1ade42065; e1d864e3fef8c78bbe4fbf3defefe3f37b0a1e61; fb1239c64ca4d9cf85027f8e6be093dc5ff0e2c9; 9aaee476bd24c5da0b1090a558c87cd0cfd52e05; f1d2397bf530dcc7de75e5326ebebfb5ed3ed7cd; 18e6b7bbea0e45e817ddbdddb2fe1633ca6e087b; f171b2ec0092b995f1cc90021165c4de5f79a073; 708ed2300753afed32f74d3493957abbbb8f32f3; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 381a6ac7b265d880d0865f94379c9f99d0e4b5a6; 970cf5b3c3374d6523c0d01be60e8948db773dfe; b838c042df9f2fda5f8e93306d2c3520dd4cdb54; 50fc6745d039c7a21b7e461ba43fb1ecfae8f1f7; d34952cb636bb76d9c5ade3f052dfdc05dbf54d0; fca2f017dcd51e58c239b5198cb44b2d69880329; aad493108390fb076b4edb517f45fcec1a03c6e6; 0a2e81477a4bfb7b26da909808f7b56b1340f014; 4be22f04382f177b992adedc54fa79ef685ee35d; 920ffaafe8c5f20b96d2c1b487e56cb3facdd6df; 377b0df6ae0388b3701d6b023ca2253f0471cb85; 3b2286d985f4c96e476666e48dbbe83ecc7b1f1d; 13fab9da337353bc3bb73ee07d8df81e8f22cb69; 609e972d35c76f80606a426b7e674dba8427c40d; e56a83bc281c093f5623525511847dcedad5d908; b9bd6a04d444ccc0c257975dfd6f61bfb197e782; e143c89fa2c18ca577ede7b1b609ecb103e187f9; c368f0a742c3d967fc913bc834942b51479dcf29; a5f017d01dbabdc6a762dede69b2c74dc79d9026; 18dba4e1d7f4789c6a5c7c149a80e31f317d383f,Medicine,98,
cbd4877c13ea54bba592638fceaefe599bce2512,Bayesian semiparametric copula estimation with application to psychiatric genetics.,"This paper proposes a semiparametric methodology for modeling multivariate and conditional distributions. We first build a multivariate distribution whose dependence structure is induced by a Gaussian copula and whose marginal distributions are estimated nonparametrically via mixtures of B-spline densities. The conditional distribution of a given variable is obtained in closed form from this multivariate distribution. We take a Bayesian approach, using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for inference. We study the frequentist properties of the proposed methodology via simulation and apply the method to estimation of conditional densities of summary statistics, used for computing conditional local false discovery rates, from genetic association studies of schizophrenia and cardiovascular disease risk factors.",2015,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ori Rosen"", ids = ""1945950""); list(name = ""Wesley K.

1a42f5c2d4c60a549b37e3e83a3a9401f41c0e4e,Whole-genome association study for milk protein composition in dairy cattle.,"Our objective was to perform a genome-wide association study for content in bovine milk of Î±(S1)-casein (Î±(S1)-CN), Î±(S2)-casein (Î±(S2)-CN), Î²-casein (Î²-CN), Îº-casein (Îº-CN), Î±-lactalbumin (Î±-LA), Î²-lactoglobulin (Î²-LG), casein index, protein percentage, and protein yield using a 50K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip. In total, 1,713 Dutch Holstein-Friesian cows were genotyped for 50,228 SNP and a 2-step association study was performed. The first step involved a general linear model and the second step used a mixed model accounting for all family relationships. Associations with milk protein content and composition were detected on 20 bovine autosomes. The main genomic regions associated with milk protein composition or protein percentage were found on chromosomes 5, 6, 11, and 14. The number of chromosomal regions showing significant (false discovery rate <0.01) effects ranged from 3 for Î²-CN and 3 for Î²-LG to 12 for Î±(S2)-CN. A genomic region on Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 6 was significantly associated with all 6 major milk proteins, and a genomic region on BTA 11 was significantly associated with the 4 caseins and Î²-LG. In addition, regions were detected that only showed a significant effect on one of the milk protein fractions: regions on BTA 13 and 22 with effects on Î±(S1)-CN; regions on BTA 1, 9, 10, 17, 19, and 28 with effects on Î±(S2)-CN; a region on BTA 6 with an effect on Î²-CN; regions on BTA 13 and 21 with effects on Îº-CN; regions on BTA 1, 5, 9, 16, 17, and 26 with effects on Î±-LA; and a region on BTA 24 with an effect on Î²-LG. The proportion of genetic variance explained by the SNP showing the strongest association in each of these genomic regions ranged from <1% for Î±(S1)-CN on BTA 22 to almost 100% for casein index on BTA 11. Variation associated with regions on BTA 6, 11, and 14 could in large part but not completely be explained by known protein variants of Î²-CN (BTA 6), Îº-CN (BTA 6), and Î²-LG (BTA 11) or DGAT1 variants (BTA 14).

bf3d4b3d7192599f6a9e95f345920c09ed67c0a4,Combined analysis of large genetic samples: new statistical approaches improve gene discovery,"Introduction Cognitive dysfunction is recognized as a core feature of schizophrenia and is considered an important predictor of functional outcomes. Despite this, current treatment strategies largely fail to ameliorate these cognitive impairments. In order to develop more efficient treatment strategies, a better understanding of the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction is needed. Accumulating evidence indicates that genetic risk of schizophrenia contributes to cognitive dysfunction. However, the precise genetic variants jointly influencing schizophrenia and cognitive function remain to be determined. Aims Here, we aimed to identify gene loci shared between schizophrenia and general cognitive function, a phenotype that captures the shared variation in performance across several cognitive domains. Methods Using a Bayesian statistical framework, we compared genome-wide association study (GWAS) data on schizophrenia from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium cohort (nÂ =Â 79,757) with GWAS data on general cognitive function from the CHARGE Consortium (nÂ =Â 53,949). By conditioning the false discovery rate (FDR) on shared associations, this statistical approach increases power to detect gene loci. Results We observed substantial polygenetic overlap between schizophrenia and general cognitive function, which replicated across independent schizophrenia sub-studies. Using the conditional FDR approach we increased discovery of gene loci and identified 13 loci shared between schizophrenia and general cognitive function. The majority of these loci (11/13) shows opposite directions of allelic effects in the phenotypes, in line with previous genetic studies and the observed cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Conclusions Our study extends the current understanding of the genetic etiology influencing schizophrenia and general cognitive function by identifying shared gene loci between the phenotypes.",2017,Psychology,"list(name = ""Olav B.

91ec8d671ca36a3c76a0bab37019f6d817a58269,Blood DNA methylation and breast cancer: A prospective case-cohort analysis in the Sister Study.,"BACKGROUND
Peripheral blood DNA methylation may be associated with breast cancer, but studies of candidate genes, global, and genome-wide DNA methylation have been inconsistent.


METHODS
We performed an epigenome-wide study using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips with prospectively collected blood DNA samples from the Sister Study, (1552 cases, 1224 sub-cohort). Differentially methylated CpGs were identified using case-cohort proportional hazard models and replicated using deposited data from EPIC-Italy (nâ€‰=â€‰329). Correlation between methylation and time-to-diagnosis was examined using robust linear regression. Causal/consequential relationships of methylation to breast cancer was examined by Mendelian randomization using OncoArray 500K SNP data. All statistical tests were two-sided.


RESULTS
We identified 9601 CpG markers associated with invasive breast cancer (false discovery rate FDR qâ€‰<â€‰0.01), with 510 meeting a strict Bonferroni correction threshold (10-7). 2095 of these CpGs replicated in the independent EPIC-Italy dataset, including 144 meeting the Bonferroni threshold. Sister Study women who developed ductal carcinoma in situ had methylation similar to non-cases. Most (1501; 71.6%) differentially methylated CpGs (dmCpGs) showed lower methylation in invasive cases. In case-only analysis methylation was statistically significantly associated (FDR qâ€‰<â€‰0.05) with time-to-diagnosis for 892 (42.6%) of the dmCpGs. Analyses based on genetic association suggest that methylation differences are likely a consequence rather than a cause of breast cancer. Pathway analysis shows enrichment of breast cancer-related gene pathways, and dmCpGs are overrepresented in known breast cancer susceptibility genes.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that DNA methylation profile of blood starts to change in response to invasive breast cancer years before the tumor is clinically detected.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zongli Xu"", ids = ""3208590""); list(name = ""Dale P Sandler"", ids = ""2470346""); list(name = ""Jack A.

Knowledge regarding the plasma fatty acid (FA) pattern in patients with liver cirrhosis is fragmentary.


OBJECTIVE
We evaluated plasma FA lipidome and its association with the prognosis of cirrhosis and severity of liver graft damage after transplantation.


DESIGN
In this observational study, plasma FA lipidome was investigated in 51 cirrhotic patients before liver transplantation and in 90 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. In addition, we studied ischemia-reperfusion damage in the liver of 38 patients for whom a graft biopsy was available at transplantation. With the use of logistic regression, we modeled the presence of cirrhosis, the dichotomized model for end-stage liver disease score below and above the median, and the presence of severe liver graft ischemia-reperfusion damage.


RESULTS
The FA pattern was markedly altered in cirrhotic patients, who showed, compared with healthy controls, higher monounsaturated FAs, lower n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated FAs, and undetectable cerotic acid. Plasma di-homo-Î³-linolenic acid was independently associated with the presence of cirrhosis (OR: 0.026; 95% CI: 0.004, 0.196; P < 0.0001), severity of its prognosis (OR: 0.041; 95% CI:0.005, 0.376; P = 0.006), postreperfusion graft hepatocellular necrosis (OR: 0.921; 95% CI: 0.851, 0.997; P = 0.043), and sinusoidal congestion (OR: 0.954; 95% CI: 0.912, 0.998; P = 0.039). Associations of di-homo-Î³-linolenic acid with the presence of cirrhosis and severity of its prognosis were confirmed also after false discovery rate correction.


CONCLUSIONS
Cerotic and di-homo-Î³-linolenic acids may serve as markers of disease and prognosis in liver cirrhosis. Dietary supplementation with di-homo-Î³-linolenic acid could be a reasonable interventional strategy to delay disease progression in liver cirrhosis.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Stefano Ginanni Corradini"", ids = ""8992390""); list(name = ""Chiara Zerbinati"", ids = ""3927662""); list(name = ""Federica Maldarelli"", ids = ""5023003""); list(name = ""Giuseppina Palmaccio"", ids = ""3770216""); list(name = ""Lucia Parlati"", ids = ""10192893""); list(name = ""Anna Giulia Bottaccioli"", ids = ""6353030""); list(name = ""Antonio Molinaro"", ids = ""1710165""); list(name = ""Edoardo Poli"", ids = ""49372999""); list(name = ""Mona Boaz"", ids = ""3730441""); list(name = ""Gaetano Serviddio"", ids = ""3917024""); list(name = ""Gianluca Mennini"", ids = ""10132243""); list(name = ""Alessandro Corsi"", ids = ""72178653""); list(name = ""Paolo G.

9ee80c32fa316cc7d507baf3cacc75aba7030f3e,Correction: Semiquantitative Analysis of Clinical Heat Stress in Clostridium difficile Strain 630 Using a GeLC/MS Workflow with emPAI Quantitation,"Clostridium difficile is considered to be the most frequent cause of infectious bacterial diarrhoea in hospitals worldwide yet its adaptive ability remains relatively uncharacterised. Here, we used GeLC/MS and the exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) calculation to determine proteomic changes in response to a clinically relevant heat stress. Reproducibility between both biological and technical replicates was good, and a 37uC proteome of 224 proteins was complemented by a 41uC proteome of 202 proteins at a 1% false discovery rate. Overall, 236 C. difficile proteins were identified and functionally categorised, of which 178 were available for comparative purposes. A total of 65 proteins (37%) were modulated by 1.5-fold or more at 41uC compared to 37uC and we noted changes in the majority of proteins associated with amino acid metabolism, including upregulation of the reductive branch of the leucine fermentation pathway. Motility was reduced at 41uC as evidenced by a 2.7 fold decrease in the flagellar filament protein, FliC, and a global increase in proteins associated with detoxification and adaptation to atypical conditions was observed, concomitant with decreases in proteins mediating transcriptional elongation and the initiation of protein synthesis. Trigger factor was down regulated by almost 5-fold. We propose that under heat stress, titration of the GroESL and dnaJK/grpE chaperones by misfolded proteins will, in the absence of trigger factor, prevent nascent chains from emerging efficiently from the ribosome causing translational stalling and also an increase in secretion. The current work has thus allowed development of a heat stress model for the key cellular processes of protein folding and export.

776d893ad682663b09ead54276ecf093bc5ad6f2,Association of CNR1 genotypes with changes in neurocognitive performance after eighteen-month treatment in patients with first-episode psychosis.,"INTRODUCTION
We analyzed the association of cannabinoid receptor CNR1 genotypes with changes in neurocognitive performance in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) after 18 months of treatment. Our secondary aim was to analyze the association of CNR1 genotypes with changes of perceived levels of stress.


METHODS
We enrolled a sample of 159 patients with FEP from two Croatian psychiatric hospitals between 2014 and 2017. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 18 months. We analyzed the associations of changes in neurocognitive test results and the perceived levels of stress with CNR1 polymorphic loci (rs7766029 and rs12720071) in 121 patients.


RESULTS
In the analysis adjusted only for baseline neurocognitive test scores, carriers of rs7766029 CC genotype had significantly (with false discovery rate, FDRâ€‰<â€‰15%) higher improvement in verbal memory (Wechsler, Wechsler 30') and attention (Digit span F) compared with other participants. In such analysis, rs12720071 carriers of AG genotype had significantly (FDRâ€‰<â€‰15%) higher improvement in executive functions (Block design), but lower improvement in language functions than AA carriers. In the fully adjusted analysis for age, sex, cannabis use and negative symptoms, only the association of rs7766029 genotypes with the change in the Weschler 30' score was significant (FDRâ€‰<â€‰15%). In the analysis adjusted only for the baseline neurocognitive tests' scores, both rs7766029 and rs12720071 genotypes were significantly associated with the change in perceived levels of stress (FDRâ€‰<â€‰15%). In the fully adjusted analysis, only the association with rs7766029 genotype remained significant.


CONCLUSIONS
The rs7766029 CNR1 variants may moderate changes in neurocognitive performance as well as in perceived levels of stress of patients with FEP over time.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Martina RojniÄ‡ Kuzman"", ids = ""134464682""); list(name = ""Dina Bosnjak Kuharic"", ids = ""51926121""); list(name = ""Lana Ganoci"", ids = ""10749376""); list(name = ""Porin Makaric"", ids = ""10688232""); list(name = ""Ivana Kekin"", ids = ""7443675""); list(name = ""Linda Rossini Gajsak"", ids = ""114605614""); list(name = ""Nikola PrpiÄ‡"", ids = ""118041368""); list(name = ""Tamara BoÅ¾ina"", ids = ""3880375""); list(name = ""Å½arko BajiÄ‡"", ids = ""51977361""); list(name = ""Nada BoÅ¾ina"", ids = ""4206934"")",9bda948e16cd97633a5346df8619c4ce4c80dd63; 7a015b2946d7d6c44779a1d142368378b6b66a06,435b5f564a617ada355d749a36527db231babb13; 3ce7368e096dfd7871f06e063ef71911106729b2; c76c9c71e1c3d2c81860316a422369778ced9c49; e16a3c16f2624fdddd036582a6fd3703335ac2f9; 46e3a229d170207f0732d6b4c4c490b59d31a498; 9abebfa4ecd1263e93f21accea1dd5d018cea34a; 0393e4f6f34c684fb4b5ed74d129fc854ca649da; 85d6d854ee026b142c8de513ec12aeb4cbf19559; 8e38a3fd905002db884b84aa11137eaa8e56bdf0; 3f5b8c5cc31344c088d3377c6659d3c47a33c003; 3e4ae946739c4b62f3af43f9ee1ff07da7d295b5; 85d7d466a8e66d57a72ee9d410ef75059974f5cb; 9d94b7f8906da8c6d5245cccd0e32cb5dff37fc6; ee300c20aa18f5c8eb37d4b9d871d7e8ee509dbe; ceae5c6204a9f292cc69dcbaa514b0fa801b29bd; 0442d79f9df020eca72c3f3b11d735f9849c9bec; f2531a99ed3eb982d3d6b6bb631180697c13b285; 91ee4d0956b39068e922926877cf01133b80c891; 1f7e240ae8e6fb40eff4cc1d6cd24a40cd7b6199; a7c3e3fda30aec943f34c4862ce7e51bf5e5a453; fff83136a188f6bf3b6abbfb44815b6fe3af295b; 846ccaf673fbcb38867771a1b1761ec06eb7977b; d569373d3f366023a6c1aafd307702dda94860c2; db56e52f17821c720298a015d32021010ca5f3c3; 4921be7abf565f677042cf14bd14bf6c709e5e2a; 729e98dce94bca06bd61b77d952bd26557acd043; a729907bf9107d38d4b66fbcfecfebac0d5b597b; 1a18b585ed661abc1f0de50be4f582ba74884d9b; 4873bf14316ba7520df04408725789deacc28e33; eab7096852f75211208c895b1c41114c8a85b1e7; b53c7c48250f89fb9e71eba187d414187df70f1a; fb4c5624719ed776788d4e6ca5f88491ec02ea5e; 4fdc30794391b95bd6375f0e9ab9e8b56110e99d; 74ca3b61f06936407930f3c25cff63616f78447d; d571fa411e98d141d6fc32a3596d31058baa4eb9; c017855637279a0c2be83438ec57ef84feca85b9; 4dd95c4ca3ffd07a93e8b54fa093478041773c70; 53f16e6d327519a8f2d57088ef9ae1804ef2261d; 32367405239f6047f88f54d86d9714ccc1ca0820; 9346a891ab2052cee806ffdc2e62548ab303c501; c0cfd85a0e0c3eb7d27f82d2bac8322b4bb80f16; 6c90773d2c13811e8943a75eb9b7dc07ffd99dd6; 9e521ca7f7d5d8ffcc7ba2d99962bcdb9288bc92; dd5c30182fa50e41f35ead4ac7e67300191ed950; cf1d949e5197753c304e2e57ef83d51543eb176f; cb4196cbab3aa059d60ce99f117526d00efb8668; b0c2e11764940db4248c90bb576863ad5eb6f4b0; 76a5872823ab3598fdb428375ed2c34fb03e4824; 9d8a0a921768cd02a652f44a914f829f46a0e5dc; 999dc4153719db9b4cd4bc46997d2c49a39957de; bda6f13e6465586ea32763649d8009c0acd37e57; ab94f0acceed296dcec11b4b415da317b6330cee,European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists,61,"

090c74b26d01a00b94acd05651fecce83f747203,DNA methylation profiles in sibling pairs discordant for intrauterine exposure to maternal gestational diabetes.,"Intrauterine exposure to hyperglycemia is reported to confer increased metabolic risk in later life, supporting the 'developmental origins of health and disease' hypothesis. Epigenetic alterations are suggested as one of the possible underlying mechanisms. In this study, we compared pairwise DNA methylation differences between siblings whose intrauterine exposure to maternal gestational diabetes (GDM) were discordant. Methylation of peripheral blood DNA of 18 sibling pairs was measured using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assays. Of the 465,447 CpG sites analyzed, 12 showed differential methylation (false discovery rate <0.15), including markers within genes associated with monogenic diabetes (HNF4A) or obesity (RREB1). The overall methylation at HNF4A showed inverse correlations with mRNA expression levels, though non significant. In a gene set enrichment analysis, metabolism and signal transduction pathways were enriched. In conclusion, we found DNA methylation markers associated with intrauterine exposure to maternal GDM, including those within genes previously implicated in diabetes or obesity.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Eunae Kim"", ids = ""2093418""); list(name = ""Soo Heon Kwak"", ids = ""4869791""); list(name = ""Hye Rim Chung"", ids = ""3703306""); list(name = ""Jung Hun Ohn"", ids = ""3348708""); list(name = ""Jae Hyun Bae"", ids = ""48746472""); list(name = ""Sung Hee Choi"", ids = ""144975484""); list(name = ""Kyong Soo Park"", ids = ""34520793""); list(name = ""Joon-Seok Hong"", ids = ""3890139""); list(name = ""Joohon Sung"", ids = ""3147475""); list(name = ""Hak Chul Jang"", ids = ""1948156"")",904cf3d19dce935228b2a8e75fc64c39b230c150; 6176a8b7e0fd7bb2d3e445da44c2d61fed6a8908; 308fbed12c9bbecdfa017009c4b4a6f020d34843; 24d016b08ba0f19798ea60f78abb6edbb5bb4609; c0b75d9122b492dd5c0fca541067e4820daca9db,,Epigenetics,12 10,"

b4f9858e0c3239eedc2461af96d935cc5b501eb1,"False Discovery Rates, Higher Criticism and Related Methods in High-Dimensional Multiple Testing","The technical advancements in genomics, functional magnetic-resonance and other areas of scientific research seen in the last two decades have led to a burst of interest in multiple testing procedures. A driving factor for innovations in the field of multiple testing has been the problem of large scale simultaneous testing. There, the goal is to uncover lowerâ€“dimensional signals from highâ€“dimensional data. Mathematically speaking, this means that the dimension d is usually in the thousands while the sample size n is relatively small (max. 100 in general, often due to cost constraints) â€” a characteristic commonly abbreviated as d n. In my thesis I look at several multiple testing problems and corresponding procedures from a false discovery rate (FDR) perspective, a methodology originally introduced in a seminal paper by Benjamini and Hochberg (2005). FDR analysis starts by fitting a twoâ€“component mixture model to the observed test statistics. This mixture consists of a null model density and an alternative component density from which the interesting cases are assumed to be drawn. In the thesis I proposed a new approach called logâ€“FDR to the estimation of false discovery rates. Specifically, my new approach to truncated maximum likelihood estimation yields accurate null model estimates. This is complemented by constrained maximum likelihood estimation for the alternative density using logâ€“concave density estimation. A recent competitor to the FDR is the method of â€œHigher Criticismâ€. It has been and strongly advocated in the context of variable selection in classification which is deeply linked to multiple comparisons. Hence, I also looked at variable selection in class prediction which can be viewed as a special signal identification problem. Both FDR methods and Higher Criticism can be highly useful for signal identification. This is discussed in the context of variable selection in linear discriminant analysis (LDA), a popular classification method. FDR methods are not only useful for multiple testing situations in the strict sense, they are also applicable to related problems. I looked at several kinds of applications of FDR in linear classification. I present and extend statistical techniques related to effect size estimation using false discovery rates and showed how to use these for variable selection.

The aim of the present study was to identify changes in the cerebrospinal fluid proteome in patients with relapsing-remitting MS and clinically isolated MS syndrome who are at high risk of developing MS (case group) compared to healthy population (control) in order to identify potential new markers, which could ultimately aid in early diagnosis of MS. The protein concentrations of each of the 11 case and 15 control samples were determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay. Nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was used for protein identification. Proteomics data were processed using the Perseus software suite and R. The results were filtered using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for the false discovery rate (FDR) correction (FDR<0.05). The results showed that, 26 proteins were significantly dysregulated in case samples compared to the controls. Nine proteins were found to be significantly less abundant in case samples, while the abundance of 17 proteins was significantly increased in case samples compared to controls. Three of the proteins were previously linked to RR MS, including immunoglobulin (Ig) Î³-1 chain C region, Ig heavy chain V-III region BRO and Ig Îº chain C region. Three proteins that were uniquely expressed in patients with RR MS were identified and these proteins may serve as prognostic biomarkers for identifying patients with a high risk of developing RR MS.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""ZbyÅ¡ek Pavelek"", ids = ""6787977""); list(name = ""Oldrich Vysata"", ids = ""2359273""); list(name = ""VojtÄ›ch Tambor"", ids = ""3864348""); list(name = ""KristÃ½na PimkovÃ¡"", ids = ""6203209""); list(name = ""Dai Long Vu"", ids = ""39279508""); list(name = ""Kamil KuÄ\215a"", ids = ""144733650""); list(name = ""Pavel Å touraÄ\215"", ids = ""6102571""); list(name = ""Martin Valis"", ids = ""2318596"")",428dfd5b18a81ea312ee821a6bce5d9c242ec898; 0123454a221a9c45559216b93ed5fa5db1b9d810; 3eae8317cf8bb17dbd7c4ee0b6c617e08ba001b7; fabc6f0dbd0e29e91b4c761c7fbb39e9637fe27b,126411d1116e3434ac06b33a9417a3aa670e7c27; c2294f4290df6157be845d7d13144e56f8dca90b; 109ef89506f0311f043653466be9e099441ea4b5; 6ac4389611fad5150b9a585f1e7d05a41deab984; 61a97a1ad464516c42553e9d682851bfcf23addb; 54af9afdc31718ab9613b05b4531bbeb4c15becb; cbd49136a917586566311af49cba0edbf3464721; b88d4399d262b8c816fd04da82778790b1d02132; 96095f67ed38f272b08f5ab8ec9655ff5fdf09ae; 426d709ab68a6d3fb2214fdf951b101e962a3638; 167b2d3de1f7827e73f75f9e9f1d50028f5fa90e; 07d79e107d1c6899839d98e333b11d56f2713497; 7c00eed17b0b9f4f7a7f2eb43bec6d00d4c4b731; 29d4a647d0618a4ad21a908967f8b89347e34752; c1f945d3068d1c8dc3aaad641c794584dc4b5ed6; e417432e7293d706c56d0a2956aa27a33254fd7e; dc7f01616aea5d85e594d6b9d1113ca3bb292d28; 13e6d58e6006bed58b0b67263ef94b3ac4c13293; d038d7acea15ed1a4454ed47f53da7135415b8a4; a968620dcf399d7d7f89f98dc1d3da8c114dac8d; 8a1127271041cb420bec9aa4be4afa5d62b2b3b7; fc3ffc45470a2c6c1790afac953936507d24fe4e; 2e9ad523bba7dde1f052be72f3a184a37a43ac7e; 852635a563d83cf4cea621229ede8db755fc817a; 2c9ea0c1487a355694264689b304a700015cd55e; 48bf927b4b00fdaf34b436d1c64de2ecb439a6fc; 72e04635e4529f04f5e2f0171e02ee4820ea7334; 82f03a714aadf601bb3582273556b01d83329a03; 60c29a330d2861f40fea207177cefc50b2bdae06; 3d84274f41c03818dd47620bfde3ec6f4e36ac45; c48de82dcd7c09fe54a92235238d2c60018c2278,Biomedical Reports,5,35 - 40
0c297f8154419545a6c2f81639026cb6addbcfb6,Multi-label Stream Classification Using Extended Binary Relevance Model,"In this paper the issue of multi-label data stream classification was addressed. To deal with the posed problem, we introduced a recognition system that is build upon a two level architecture. The first level is a Binary Relevance multi-label classifier, and the second is a correction procedure that employs competence and cross-competence measures to adjust the output of the Binary Relevance classifier. The measures are calculated in a lazy manner using a local, fuzzy confusion matrix which is a generalized version of commonly known confusion matrix. The matrix follows the changes in the data stream by using a sliding window approach. The sliding window is implemented as a simple FIFO queue. During the experimental study the algorithm was compared against 2 state-of-the-art approaches using 12 benchmark datasets. The classification quality of the investigated model was performed using 8 different evaluation measures. The conducted the experiments revealed that the proposed method outperforms the reference methods in terms of the Hamming loss and micro-averaged False Discovery Rate. On the other hand, the experimental outcome suggests that, in general, the corrected base classifiers of the BR ensemble are biased towards the majority class.",2015,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Pawel Trajdos"", ids = ""1901879""); list(name = ""Marek Kurzynski"", ids = ""145111724"")",,,,2,205-210
773a45e8dac15ab9edf9343ddcb78f40dccb8e6d,Scaled False Discovery Proportion and Related Error Metrics,"In multiple testing, a variety of control metrics of false positives have been introduced such as the Per Family Error Rate (PFER), Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER), the False Discovery Rate (FDR), the False Exceedence Rate (FER). In this talk, we present a comprehensive family of error rates together with a corresponding family of multiple testing procedures (MTP). Based on the needs of the problem at hand, the user can choose a particular member among these MTPs. The new error rate limits the number of false positives FP relative to an arbitrary non-decreasing function s of the number of rejections R. The quantity is called, the scaled false discovery proportion SFDP=FP/s(R). We present different procedures to control either the P(SFDP>q) or the E(SFDP) for any choice of the scaling function. An obvious choice is s(R)=min(R;k). As does FDR, this particular error rate FP/s(R) accepts a fixed percentage of false rejections among all rejections, but only up to R =k, then a stricter control takes over and for R > k, the number of false positives is limited to a percentage of the fixed value k, similar to PFER. The corresponding family of multiple testing procedures bridges the gap between the PFER (k =1) and the FDR (k = number of tests). A similar such bridge is obtained when s(R)=Rg with 0<=g<=1, which for g=0.5 controls the percentage of false discoveries relative to the square root of R. In the talk, we discuss the choice of the parameters k and g based on the minimization of the expected loss t E(FP) - E(TP) = t E(FP) - E(R - FP) which is based on the idea that a false positive costs a penalty of 1",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Djalel Eddine Meskaldji"", ids = ""5819738""); list(name = ""Jean-Philippe Thiran"", ids = ""1710257""); list(name = ""S.

16a70227704882f5506794720c600dc29a00ada1,RANK: Large-Scale Inference with Graphical Nonlinear Knockoffs,"Power and reproducibility are key to enabling refined scientific discoveries in contemporary big data applications with general high-dimensional nonlinear models. In this paper, we provide theoretical foundations on the power and robustness for the model-free knockoffs procedure introduced recently in Cand\`{e}s, Fan, Janson and Lv (2016) in high-dimensional setting when the covariate distribution is characterized by Gaussian graphical model. We establish that under mild regularity conditions, the power of the oracle knockoffs procedure with known covariate distribution in high-dimensional linear models is asymptotically one as sample size goes to infinity. When moving away from the ideal case, we suggest the modified model-free knockoffs method called graphical nonlinear knockoffs (RANK) to accommodate the unknown covariate distribution. We provide theoretical justifications on the robustness of our modified procedure by showing that the false discovery rate (FDR) is asymptotically controlled at the target level and the power is asymptotically one with the estimated covariate distribution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first formal theoretical result on the power for the knockoffs procedure. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to existing approaches, our method performs competitively in both FDR control and power. A real data set is analyzed to further assess the performance of the suggested knockoffs procedure.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""YingYing Fan"", ids = ""2193729""); list(name = ""Emre Demirkaya"", ids = ""89804042""); list(name = ""Gaorong Li"", ids = ""2219583""); list(name = ""Jinchi Lv"", ids = ""35118626"")",716705d90b7f0be22a6fe1cf382127bde008acdf; f7345d1bc72175a2213dac2ac07e867efd3900d7; f822d9a7512b3cbb1c986aa7a160d6b731bdbd02; 97556d4893a58623c51f55754df9dff5214e9823; f2e01223509292a0e2829046ded30baea2e21a3a; 80c91e58aaa1da31910ee7497e7c1af31680fc2d; c2046d215d59333a96d4cc1ca5ab02b40002cf8c; 1116fbd784e20a032e90251ad34f7e5660df0ae9; 837f2f52f8fc66c524803efd5658761393c5cd4a; 2b3169eddd9ec235f7c07c08251a3a41cbdcfa77; 24fbd7bf0a4f543bcbaf1fe5b97d6399f65078ec; a3aae676ecf4dc82d3e84525ebc8aae226ce6992; 958af62fbcb24e6f128abacd0f6fee81c02f4db7; ed9716278a7dedc4699622c5a0a9a3ca76740728,4e1f5afeeb16c38d443e623963d039cdc502f8c4; 6bd04db6adc58d44f7134786068749f30667cc69; 76f667df49db0e5a3a2f4fdd45995a120d3a6c32; 9e26c8be21f341102016fa5a67b06db362bf272a; 668518aeabdbb79d5294d80b7e2081f05c95e320; f939bf6ee0e0e2f32275dce7882faacc25bdf8a1; 2a586c5a0fb9385632868692adffba8d9b9d30c1; 2ebf7bc98d17230034de0c87c1713d0cb45783c6; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; bee570503aaa0ed5bc5dd4cf6aa742df0b5cef87; 003e586edfa3101af83abb21c694f89aef007b7a; 535ca23d1a06f921bdcd281d03363a111db03d3a; 1f2a3e620a9f8de6010dbcfb124014d7d7532630; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; e69bce0185720fcb652ae458a4529a2807f53de8; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 8abb749d8ed04369d214dafc1a18bb33cf69f77b; 2a4a3c9b6aac9733e11c8860a5be1f2d32a617bd; cf6da91d65cf8f01c4708fd95044e55fa495478c; 6ea2b6bbacd7b5e7f444b9ad01336ee670d81b92; 7b016ec752179e5b59fd197f5d269b39d98596dd; 54542eba3c6ce5094eded2599fea3cf3442dba9a; 5e147ca57ea8ba09c571abc2fb75a02724c1b611; 3f9dab37087dfe50d8e8fc8aedd3c0c899ece8fc; 14d44a92d33fbc1ccf8870f103501c53852adafb; 6b0dd924f1374e308fc577eb34a0525173cb3cff; ea54f0c0568cab38619ee51e6ac021e76d6a6559; 7fe59a873246a62128549c29cb3543cb9390f1d5; f2e01223509292a0e2829046ded30baea2e21a3a; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; 2d490f5727a2010367f15187f49aa0ff6521fcbd; eddb3766525ad09e831933782f9d210e15449065; 918f6216cf0c7e95825737fdef804cba610d0785; 1f516d7f06745bc7f0518639a428ada05ef12cd8; c1d520e7dd5539f3ed37bd655dacb782ae31ea87; b789f675ca9600eab82a39c581abc1db53d47d14; 436c9131973050eae4c1bdf34a7f6013a7df93f7; bb92178d5133f9165b704500cbe2e5a1b2dab01d; b7160d496c06316a1abdeb49af232a6b5abd500b; be955f315af99ec7aceb4eaf205e3327e6a78600; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc; cfc5ec7a4d3d74e8b9e2eda75c7baea4966609f5; c5e79010bb2e373c5ce2950153e9b67fe18c4c83; f2b32a6b32c6e913c6423526e49a02cc7c8c18da; 0cc325ee022c258b30da3247a60828f7adf4d14c; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; b54b28c0af32deca139f01e34119f50f60bc5c6e; a4cb43cb128743ac2426c7611f8c0e567371dd6b; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; c9e55b6ecc6f65d2735830dede4f8d2bdf531d34; bd1233f3707a76684f8801741de78b4bf879f643; 57cca95fdbd35ba1b283c9c6ec5ae7a81be7adfd; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 085398f269e503e93ddcebfa511db1fbc527e80e; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 1a2b5877f6849192fc415539844b98c08b239c02; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; eba50a16826e34ee3041671120beabeaf3173802; 5c7416638acf9836d0bd2dbb5c269c8e07604ad4; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,1-43
7053fbbcb65c810aec3a71733e811670a597edcd,Whole genome analysis for liver metastasis gene signatures in colorectal cancer.,"Liver metastasis is one of the major causes of death in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. To understand this process, we investigated whether the gene expression profiling of matched colorectal carcinomas and liver metastases could reveal key molecular events involved in tumor progression and metastasis. We performed experiments using a cDNA microarray containing 17,104 genes with the following tissue samples: paired tissues of 25 normal colorectal mucosa, 27 primary colorectal tumors, 13 normal liver and 27 liver metastasis, and 20 primary colorectal tumors without liver metastasis. To remove the effect of normal cell contamination, we selected 4,583 organ-specific genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.0067% by comparing normal colon and liver tissues using significant analysis of microarray, and these genes were excluded from further analysis. We then identified and validated 46 liver metastasis-specific genes with an accuracy of 83.3% by comparing the expression of paired primary colorectal tumors and liver metastases using prediction analysis of microarray. The 46 selected genes contained several known oncogenes and 2 ESTs. To confirm that the results correlated with the microarray expression patterns, we performed RT-PCR with WNT5A and carbonic anhydrase II. Additionally, we observed that 21 of the 46 genes were differentially expressed (FDR=2.27%) in primary tumors with synchronous liver metastasis compared with primary tumors without liver metastasis. We scanned the human genome using a cDNA microarray and identified 46 genes that may play an important role in the progression of liver metastasis in CRC.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Dong Hyuk Ki"", ids = ""2484122"");

671999c3e7e50b400afd7c21d6a27f5842cbde1d,Hybrid Dragonfly Optimization-Based Artificial Neural Network for the Recognition of Epilepsy,"Epilepsy can well be stated as a disorder of the central nervous systems (CNS) that brought about recurring seizures owing to chronic abnormal blasts of electrical discharge on the brain. Knowing if an individual is having a seizure and diagnosing the seizure type or epilepsy syndrome could be hard. Many methods were developed to recognize this disease. But the existing techniques for detection of epilepsy are not satisfied with accuracy, and cannot identify the diseases effectively. To trounce these drawbacks, this paper proposes an approach for the recognition of Epilepsy as of the electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This is implemented as follows. Primarily, the Kalman filter (KF) is utilized for pre-processing to eradicate the impulse noise present in the EEG signals. This filtered signal is then decomposed utilizing variablemodes decomposition (VMD). Feature extraction (FE) is performed by computing 7 features. The dimensionality of this signal is then lessened using Modified-Principal Components Analysis (M-PCA). Finally, classification is conducted utilizing the artificial neural networks (ANN) that is optimized using the hybrid dragonfly algorithm (HDA). Disparate performance metrics such as sensitivity, accuracy, and false discovery rates (FDR) are ascertained and as well weighted against with the existent works.",2019,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""K.

e7f28bdce400e54dadc0aa1e0e84b2b17b95754b,Integrative High Dimensional Multiple Testing with Heterogeneity under Data Sharing Constraints.,"Identifying informative predictors in a high dimensional regression model is a critical step for association analysis and predictive modeling. Signal detection in the high dimensional setting often fails due to the limited sample size. One approach to improve power is through meta-analyzing multiple studies on the same scientific question. However, integrative analysis of high dimensional data from multiple studies is challenging in the presence of between study heterogeneity. The challenge is even more pronounced with additional data sharing constraints under which only summary data but not individual level data can be shared across different sites. In this paper, we propose a novel data shielding integrative large-scale testing (DSILT) approach to signal detection by allowing between study heterogeneity and not requiring sharing of individual level data. Assuming the underlying high dimensional regression models of the data differ across studies yet share similar support, the DSILT approach incorporates proper integrative estimation and debiasing procedures to construct test statistics for the overall effects of specific covariates. We also develop a multiple testing procedure to identify significant effects while controlling for false discovery rate (FDR) and false discovery proportion (FDP). Theoretical comparisons of the DSILT procedure with the ideal individual--level meta--analysis (ILMA) approach and other distributed inference methods are investigated. Simulation studies demonstrate that the DSILT procedure performs well in both false discovery control and attaining power. The proposed method is applied to a real example on detecting interaction effect of the genetic variants for statins and obesity on the risk for Type 2 Diabetes.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Molei Liu"", ids = ""46175887""); list(name = ""Yin Xia"", ids = ""152428284""); list(name = ""Kelly Cho"", ids = ""50428022""); list(name = ""Tianxi Cai"", ids = ""91879489"")",,8c104e4f9c4206874f530b7151cdb43e181f6c37; 5f56320c5979faeab78dbd9ddb7db755ba4550f3; 02c8cac2d4415630db16fcb884e2c3e055ca1691; d6db548319b39df8030d1854fa803234cac75bd6; 24e5b048340f27cd2aa6dc115b7df443dcf77b3b; 577b8fad5691f91a006367dbfe1724b9f62d281f; 1f639f5ba1bbc808cc1b0562fc46943496c9585a; 6410ec306cfec30aa85d2172ac9eba1ef5bea4cc; 9542f16f46fec8f7afef2dc6d7eb8b7d755d7354; 315d1eed34cc519b51904b19f899145d220736b8; e5462f48aba02e154edc1fd1553f994857b2ab63; 88b5b59ed20f551e238d7f076a1ff9f03a68882f; 9045a9a223ec46da1bf7faeb2e2f0faccc9b4cd8; aac33c19f5ae665345bba1fac335cce3977a7cff; d06798476ae907160dc4ec6b88be466fdcdb8b6d; 4dd299532905a97c875d308bbe7aa8a6214ecb1e; f9f15d0c475479c5afa6e53691cd8e0b16752ffc; fd392a4353966102517722cdcbbb860b0f6e7130; 917268ce9560c5cf8f1a49f0890668bb2de0346f; c558db26fcd4ea18d07a6a67203f6bf7b88b7cdb; 6f0babac6ec9c2c0f12e5dd8997efbc739bff3bf; 7e02d76524e6b98ecf5f9b7b881b4b496b49a4f4; d3ed55a6b3ce2ed3a92b3b45eeb3c1510d519195; 34e8c10e679102c96292e8c6113541574480a116; e576415557f8fa16205b682eef79bd63e258af74; 6a4743293f22c2e30636dae29fa77cea9cc0f317; 8a9dcc30448c4d660abbce058c8ec7d1dba78976; 3b857a79f0141f2e3301521d27cab1660e8ec5b6; b033bb34afc2e5fabcd63e1dd80c08fe9a05cbfe; 67cb810d54b9814addafca03c05b203947b6b143; 46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; 854d382e5a1e9a691b026d29331c6a19f854a488; c29a73a978ed60fab2bc0a79e1129a47a7a3b6ed; 97a3dad39601246bb779eaecf178564d986cfe55; 5335fb1670524b2eb16335a223272ca25f650f4d; 127a6f7efbdcd222682bcb58df8280bfeaed501d; e3bd6e93288c00b45cb0b6fc1723cfa3f15161db; 23a96514f84e452aaa921e8ea3b65b396cab52c8; 05855c94a57a82f194a9c1191fd060436302d121; 130b422390129d903e76700d7a2fe141d14f30bf; ef1bf316ce572888268aba556d8534768e8c816a; 4ca5a833b8464a1e7ab46d04db6aeb2794eca848; 43cd796477ee178527632c6529bfee265e97007b; bd0f9c9199101063902a6cf85eaea58eea654900; f508d7f1b649bc5129117670f69b5a7a79332ca9; b356eca39185f7f0e3624d2060a379fc6314d37f; f71fd7a5f6ac710bec87cd08c5cb396d471f4309; ae2b9e8e1e543ff22d5e2e7bb472b02140ee0f1d; c49ccb47252bdbf16ceec8bc494649da87caba1d; 214b67c3108215362d507de3c3eb698f72eb011f; f36eb827b7c9f2c457ee8ed24eebc6e9178ef047; c0d6be137e09fec80af3208141844650a6fa1239; 67f33b4ea84c8cf815a9919dd34fee6e85c22f6f,arXiv: Methodology,,

In the present work, we report on gene expression differences in the breast of parous versus nulliparous healthy premenopausal women. Using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays, we analyzed the gene expression profile of breast tissue from 30 nulliparous (NP) and 79 parous (P) premenopausal volunteers between the ages of 30 and 47 years who were free of breast pathology. Because of the known short-term increase in breast cancer risk preceding the long-term protective effect of FTP, we also examined gene expression differences in P vs. NP women as a function of time since last FTP. Through multiple regression analysis, controlling for confounders, we found 416 probesets differentially expressed (fold-change â‰¥ 1.2 and false discovery rate Citation Format: Julia Santucci-Pereira, Anne Zeleniuch-Jacquotte, Yelena Afanasyeva, Hua Zhong, Eric A.

We derive an approximate formula for the distribution of regularized t-statistics and develop a formula of sample size calculation for regularized t-statistics. The sample size is determined based on sensitivity under certain conditions to maintain a certain false discovery rate using a mixture model.

However, the carcinogenic mode of action of arsenicals is unknown. We investigated the effects of inorganic arsenic (iAsIII), monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII), dimethylarsinous acid (DMAIII) and dimethylthioarsinic acid (DMTA), a sulfur containing dimethyl arsenic metabolite, in human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells. Cells were exposed to 3, 15 microM-iAsIII; 0.3, 1 microM-MMAIII; 0.2, 1 microM-DMAIII; 0.2, 0.9 microM-DMTA as non-cytotoxic and minimally cytotoxic ( approximately 20%) concentrations based on Neutral Red uptake assays after 24h of culture. Total RNA was isolated and gene expression analysis conducted using Affymetrix Human Genome 133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined using a one-way ANOVA (p < or =0.05) by Rosetta Resolver, a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR (false discovery rate) multiple testing correction (< 0.05) followed by a Scheffe's post hoc test. For all compounds except DMTA, > 90% of DEG altered in the low concentration were also changed at the high concentration. There was a clear dose-response seen in the number of DEGs for all four compounds. iAsIII showed the highest number of DEG at both concentrations (2708 and 123, high and low, respectively). 1749, 420 and 120 DEGs were unique to the high concentrations of iAsIII, MMAIII and DMAIII, respectively. Transferrin receptor is a common DEG in low concentration arsenical treated cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed p53 signaling (E2F1 and 2, SERPIN), and cell cycle related genes (cyclin D1) were altered by the high concentrations of DMTA, MMAIII and iAsIII. Oxidative stress (DUSP1, GPX2, NQO1, GCLC) and NF-kappaB signaling (TLR4, NF-kappaB) pathways were changed by the high concentrations of MMAIII and iAsIII. The genes identified in this study can be a valuable tool to determine the mechanism of arsenic toxicity and cancer formation. A number of similarities were observed in the gene expression profiles of DMAIII and DMTA and also iAsIII and MMAIII. These findings reveal some biological effects of arsenicals that will aid in creating a better risk assessment model for arsenical-induced lung cancer.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jaya Chilakapati"", ids = ""47156312""); list(name = ""Kathleen H Wallace"", ids = ""35924761""); list(name = ""Hongzu Ren"", ids = ""38416410""); list(name = ""Michael Fricke"", ids = ""31887176""); list(name = ""Kathryn Bailey"", ids = ""144124840""); list(name = ""William Ward"", ids = ""144616456""); list(name = ""Jack Creed"", ids = ""50683908""); list(name = ""Kirk Kitchin"", ids = ""46424550"")",8cbaf082bd563d34bf29b4e0ba1b06300344e696; dd0595093854df28f232d79f88e89a8f183eaab3; 0cf82f5172a8c5eb7fa9df0542b94f6707d663c8; 7258e540195720135015d4bf1b44454f34ae850d; 56f2ada9c2150f25789d5bcf34a8b9f0565f9cd6; 7fe185193bcef74b787599b1664d916b75cbd80f; df253857d09a1fef4ce595a01ccaa9629657cb89; 7a3fdc243362609528b84c47629dc2a9dc8ef6eb; 56e4844ecfeddedb8f668f09d8391769a3bfbdab; 5686973df4776ee53827570993f3439c1cd9269b; 9ec34118f34d67c515e443e3e657ac664c400306; a9b2a86d5a339d999d82693c15597b82a47bb92a; afeaaa61e1d67d4fb046fcfdd79634c2fe4e5d25; defde9670b863e19e49727fc18673d507d67a11b; 5d45b24f5819275c9fb7cfe4f8bcc18c472a0410; 0e7a0d75a38cd8d490d46f7059365982617e62f1; 432112f7deed6f199420a2a63f2e5d85a72a0cc1; 476e18f2d82998d292e3a958e5a30dc1b017d29c; e6b7784a75b61d1d4722e9c0e2bc164de7831366; c0dd13b133b11562979dac8256fd040909b6ed00,,Toxicology,268 1-2,"

b4684027fb10d858b76284720d62c1b3bf7031d5,Neural correlates of disturbed perception of verticality,"Objective: Perception of verticality can be perturbed after cortical stroke. However, a relationship between lesion location and pathologic perception of verticality is still a matter of debate since previous studies revealed contradictory results. Thus, the aim of the current study was to test whether specific cortical lesions were associated with tilts of subjective visual vertical (SVV) and to determine the critical brain areas that cause such tilts in the case of a lesion. Methods: SVV was systematically studied in 54 patients (22 patients with left-sided and 32 patients with right-sided lesions) with acute unilateral strokes, analyzed by modern voxel-wise lesion-behavior mapping techniques. Results: The data give evidence for an association between tilt of SVV and the insular cortex (IC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in both hemispheres. Whereas the IC seems to be the prominent structure in the left hemisphere, the IFG is most affected in the right hemisphere. Furthermore, other cortical regions such as the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the rolandic operculum as well asâ€”subcorticallyâ€”the inferior occipitofrontal fascicle and the superior longitudinal fascicle seem to be involved in the vestibulo-cortical network for the perception of verticality in the roll plane. Conclusion: Damage to these regions might lead to an imbalance within the vestibular network of one hemisphere due to a deficit in multimodal signal processing.

2dde05461e68af684f020e6df0b520c21da7e8b2,Assessing the Associations of Blood Metabolites With Osteoporosis: A Mendelian Randomization Study,"Context
Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease. The effect of blood metabolites on the development of osteoporosis remains elusive.


Objective
To explore the relationship between blood metabolites and osteoporosis.


Design and Methods
We used 2286 unrelated white subjects for the discovery samples and 3143 unrelated white subjects from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) for the replication samples. The bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed using Affymetrix Human SNP Array 6.0 (for discovery samples) and Affymetrix SNP 500K and 50K array (for FHS replication samples). The SNP sets significantly associated with blood metabolites were obtained from a reported whole-genome sequencing study. For each subject, the genetic risk score of the metabolite was calculated from the genotype data of the metabolite-associated SNP sets. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential effect of blood metabolites on the variations in bone phenotypes; 10,000 permutations were conducted to calculate the empirical P value and false discovery rate.


Results
We analyzed 481 blood metabolites. We identified multiple blood metabolites associated with hip BMD, such as 1,5-anhydroglucitol (Pdiscovery < 0.0001; Preplication = 0.0361), inosine (Pdiscovery = 0.0018; Preplication = 0.0256), theophylline (Pdiscovery = 0.0048; Preplication = 0.0433, gamma-glutamyl methionine (Pdiscovery = 0.0047; Preplication = 0.0471), 1-linoleoyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC (18:2/20:4n6; Pdiscovery = 0.0018; Preplication = 0.0390), and X-12127 (Pdiscovery = 0.0002; Preplication = 0.0249).


Conclusions
Our results suggest a modest effect of blood metabolites on the variations of BMD and identified several candidate blood metabolites for osteoporosis.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Li Liu"", ids = ""49480323""); list(name = ""Yan Wen"", ids = ""144116102""); list(name = ""Lei Zhang"", ids = ""48570934""); list(name = ""Peng Xu"", ids = ""47568758""); list(name = ""Xiao Liang"", ids = ""144160067""); list(name = ""Yanan Du"", ids = ""46941353""); list(name = ""Ping Li"", ids = ""39119350""); list(name = ""Awen He"", ids = ""6429445""); list(name = ""Qianrui Fan"", ids = ""9768444""); list(name = ""Jingcan Hao"", ids = ""2210719""); list(name = ""Wenyu Wang"", ids = ""4705329""); list(name = ""Xiong Guo"", ids = ""145339795""); list(name = ""Hui Shen"", ids = ""51069670""); list(name = ""Qing Tian"", ids = ""144876832""); list(name = ""Feng Zhang"", ids = ""10412440""); list(name = ""Hong-Wen Deng"", ids = ""144156424"")",69ff78257c5a5b4580c1c7811b02ec4f78c5da70; 01796ad02607904ad2fb212f3c8e7706b300a819; 4fa5bc252101837bedb2852312672f4be44f407f; 31b1055736c3609ed67db65294ef6490caa7983e,aa4c53b6b56e8fa602b3999d563bb17ae47eb29e; c8b7c8cfa85d3c25cadd74489b2f01d8c4774e89; 786886c6f437e1592a5738e34f12ecebce67598d; 20fcdd40e92df4675d0d4209dbe27df571175b87; 60ff47ef8746398518d0214bc70ea173d55b2872; c8802df40d4a81bd788da9d1928f2d59f16c9e2c; 9d10367c238f0c0cb2115ac9873b43da4bbd0720; e74e089b2b295a3ae1c25172eb5457d146ddebd1; 6c12e9d2dabba20931575977fd275972fef3c84f; bbcd4589f46fefa8a4f74cc829e8cb34ea7da2e3; fb52978fd617432fd837917dcffbd1b055473d22; 32deebdddc145d323da7b9d3fd1ccdb0de5cde03; 226737712fb7b8826dd55c7b1606ae22596f18cf; 2897acb4f1ede7018d50dfa1a3ebbe7a321c1c07; bfada85634fd5481e737efa56d1bcea6ff469778; 87b30d9e6464dab8aa872cc1cf44dec0feb0b6ae; 2182c1f8926bfe8c595559116766b32fd70b97d3; ec6d3b2d2b144f61804067ea6c1f183762fe3981; 2e12ce6c7cfc52c0e896ec208ea2f57a848058be; 8411afea6a439386d43b1139728439c20d42130e; bcde7faebab4a259ec2bede2662c7980c9a43da2; 72d8d2ced6b91dced6df126330d2895113883909; fad188261e326f17ca3d7333a4a330f86aa2da4e; 829c731c22252a3734d9e66cb500174eb4f8d18e; a5974f9efe743f472ff6884549c6ba59365347ee; b8138f84d549fa26c1736b2398c0a6ee46192307; 3cedc7c34c98f2894095401e9f82f8d2d0246927; 1398bf4e988c16f35e7adc8deb4f917043bd5998; b28defa2e1809b99ddd044919d031458245aee56; 524613c40ac411ed5a7d57190181dee3838e0869; f81b5f4c93e0bb65dcfd45dca68e87bd6407bce0; d6cbda5563da22f4505c1264993dc1d985fbafdf; 5abc179f380d35ce20377ea0f5859772796c1acd; 82e9a57831ac5fef430131f608b7c6712d8dfc58; f6b4b144aa4931c8d429e425557f9a529e3257cc; 2583a559909d86ffb5781795d1ab85d57db2a9b9; 9c91f5e93d1bd05708718c14f39ac02d4f52ab28,The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism,103,1850â€“1855
0e582ef48e4592cb439e58311cf50d94f9477c2d,"Metabolomics Profile in Depression: A Pooled Analysis of 230 Metabolic Markers in 5283 Cases With Depression and 10,145 Controls","BACKGROUND
Depression has been associated with metabolic alterations, which adversely impact cardiometabolic health. Here, a comprehensive set of metabolic markers, predominantly lipids, was compared between depressed and nondepressed persons.


METHODS
Nine Dutch cohorts were included, comprising 10,145 control subjects and 5283 persons with depression, established with diagnostic interviews or questionnaires. A proton nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics platform provided 230 metabolite measures: 51 lipids, fatty acids, and low-molecular-weight metabolites; 98 lipid composition and particle concentration measures of lipoprotein subclasses; and 81 lipid and fatty acids ratios. For each metabolite measure, logistic regression analyses adjusted for gender, age, smoking, fasting status, and lipid-modifying medication were performed within cohort, followed by random-effects meta-analyses.


RESULTS
Of the 51 lipids, fatty acids, and low-molecular-weight metabolites, 21 were significantly related to depression (false discovery rate q < .05). Higher levels of apolipoprotein B, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, diglycerides, total and monounsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid chain length, glycoprotein acetyls, tyrosine, and isoleucine and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, acetate, and apolipoprotein A1 were associated with increased odds of depression. Analyses of lipid composition indicators confirmed a shift toward less high-density lipoprotein and more very-low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride particles in depression. Associations appeared generally consistent across gender, age, and body mass index strata and across cohorts with depressive diagnoses versus symptoms.

We investigated whether meQTLs exist in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and if CpG methylation associates with metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) phenotypes. We profiled 27,718 genomic regions in abdominal SAT samples of 38 unrelated individuals using differential methylation hybridization (DMH) together with genotypes at 5,227,243 SNPs and expression of 17,209 mRNA transcripts. Validation and replication of significant meQTLs was pursued in an independent cohort of 181 female twins. We find that, at 5% false discovery rate, methylation levels of 149 DMH regions associate with at least one SNP in a Â±500 kilobase cis-region in our primary study. We sought to validate 19 of these in the replication study and find that five of these significantly associate with the corresponding meQTL SNPs from the primary study. We find that none of the 149 meQTL top SNPs is a significant expression quantitative trait locus in our expression data, but we observed association between expression levels of two mRNA transcripts and cis-methylation status. Our results indicate that DNA CpG methylation in abdominal SAT is partly under genetic control.

a370589c2ca168764aeff2e52dc4d491c188dae3,Effects of CYP4F2 genetic polymorphisms and haplotypes on clinical outcomes in patients initiated on warfarin therapy.,"BACKGROUND
A variant in the CYP4F2 gene, rs2108622, has been recently shown to determine stable warfarin dose requirements. CYP4F2 has also been shown recently to metabolize vitamin K.


METHODS
Three hundred and eleven patients were recruited prospectively from two UK hospitals and followed-up for 6 months. Fine mapping of the whole CYP4F2 region was performed to try and define the haplotype structure of CYP4F2. Genotyping was performed on the Sequenom platform. Univariate and multiple regression analyses were undertaken to assess the effect of CYP4F2 on predefined clinical outcomes of warfarin response.


RESULTS
Fifty-nine single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CYP4F2 gene were analyzed. There was a high degree of linkage disequilibrium in the gene with two haplotype blocks. No association was found with warfarin stable dose and rs2108622 in our prospective cohort of patients even after adjustments to reduce patient heterogeneity. Interestingly, a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs2189784), which is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs2108622, showed an association with time-to-therapeutic international normalized ratio which remained significant after the correction for multiple testing (Pc = 0.03). No association was shown with the haplotypes after false discovery rate correction.


CONCLUSION
Although we were unable to demonstrate an association between rs2108622 and stable warfarin dose, our finding of an association between rs2189784 and time-to-therapeutic international normalized ratio is consistent with the recent finding that CYP4F2 plays a role in vitamin K metabolism. However, the effect of CYP4F2 is relatively small in all studies undertaken so far, and thus seems unlikely to be of clinical relevance.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jieying Eunice Zhang"", ids = ""49049990""); list(name = ""Andrea L.

36df490f40c99b7c1208da66dea3aaee2a559852,Gene Expression Profiling of Microdissected Hodgkin Reed Sternberg Cells: Molecular Subtypes and Treatment Outcome Correlations.,"Abstract 268 INTRODUCTION: Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is unique among lymphomas due to the scarcity of the malignant Hodgkin Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells, which are derived from clonal germinal center B cells. Investigations using laser capture microdissection permit more detailed analysis of these cells. However, most recent studies were limited by low case numbers and lack of available clinical data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 29 cases of cHL and the 5 HL lines KMH2, HDLM2, L428, L540, and L1236 by gene expression profiling. All patients were treated at the BC Cancer Agency between 1984 and 2006 and received at least 4 cycles of polychemotherapy and stage-dependent radiotherapy. The cohort also included 5 biopsies taken at relapse. Treatment failure was defined as disease progression or relapse at any time (n=14) after initiation of treatment; treatment success as absence of progression (n=15). We used laser microdissection (Molecular Machines & Industries Cellcut with Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S microscope) to study the enriched HRS cell compartment separately from the microenvironment. RNA extraction was performed on pools of 1000 microdissected HRS cells in each case. Gene expression profiles were generated using Affymetrix HG UA133 2.0 Plus arrays using two-cycle labeling reactions. HRS cell profiles were compared to microdissected germinal centers (GC), and HL cell line profiles compared to enriched tonsillar CD77+ centroblasts (MACS cell separation, Miltenyi). Furthermore, we compared gene expression profiles of treatment failures to those of treatment successes. RESULTS: We identified 1342 differentially expressed probesets (fold change >5, False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjusted p value 5, FDR-adjusted p value DISCUSSION: Using microdissection of HRS cells in a large number of cases we were able to further characterize the unique expression program of HL and refine the data inventory about dysregulated cellular functions and pathways in this disease. Overexpression of genes associated with NFÎºB, complement and hematopoietic progenitor cells proliferation correlate strongly with treatment failure. Further study using immunohistochemistry is currently ongoing to validate these findings and to develop clinically useful biomarkers.

a941ee33c582f63dec424b2f3b231670bcbbb4c1,A synthetic peptide library for benchmarking crosslinking-mass spectrometry search engines for proteins and protein complexes,"Crosslinking-mass spectrometry (XL-MS) serves to identify interaction sites between proteins. Numerous search engines for crosslink identification exist, but lack of ground truth samples containing known crosslinks has precluded their systematic validation. Here we report on XL-MS data arising from measuring synthetic peptide libraries that provide the unique benefit of knowing which identified crosslinks are true and which are false. The data are analysed with the most frequently used search engines and the results filtered to an estimated false discovery rate of 5%. We find that the actual false crosslink identification rates range from 2.4 to 32%, depending on the analysis strategy employed. Furthermore, the use of MS-cleavable crosslinkers does not reduce the false discovery rate compared to non-cleavable crosslinkers. We anticipate that the datasets acquired during this research will further drive optimisation and development of XL-MS search engines, thereby advancing our understanding of vital biological interactions. Validating crosslinking-mass spectrometry workflows is hampered by the lack of a ground truth to assess the robustness of the crosslink identifications.

c65758237547e38111006d8696bbc2e7f5a58a9c,A transcriptional profile of the decidua in preeclampsia.,"OBJECTIVE
We sought to obtain insight into possible mechanisms underlying preeclampsia using genomewide transcriptional profiling in decidua basalis.


STUDY DESIGN
Genomewide transcriptional profiling was performed on decidua basalis tissue from preeclamptic (n = 37) and normal (n = 58) pregnancies. Differentially expressed genes were identified and merged into canonical pathways and networks.


RESULTS
Of the 26,504 expressed transcripts detected, 455 were differentially expressed (P < .05; false discovery rate, P < .1). Both novel (ARL5B, SLITRK4) and previously reported preeclampsia-associated (PLA2G7, HMOX1) genes were identified. Pathway analysis revealed that tryptophan metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum stress, linoleic acid metabolism, notch signaling, fatty acid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response were overrepresented canonical pathways.


CONCLUSION
In the present study single genes, canonical pathways, and gene-gene networks that are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia have been identified. Future functional studies are needed to accomplish a greater understanding of the mechanisms involved.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mari LÃ¸set"", ids = ""1398179993""); list(name = ""Siv B.

f10fd4d385fa90a66f7ef873d1bf47604e7bf7da,Power calculations for multicenter imaging studies controlled by the false discovery rate.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used in brain imaging research (neuroimaging) to explore structural and functional changes across dispersed neural networks visible only via multisubject experiments. Multicenter investigations are an effective way to increase recruitment rates. This article describes image-based power calculations for a two-group, cross-sectional design specified by the mean effect size and its standard error, sample size, false discovery rate (FDR), and size of the network (i.e., proportion of image locations) that truly demonstrates an effect. Minimum sample size (for fixed effect size) and the minimum effect size (for fixed sample size) are calculated by specifying the acceptable power threshold. Within-center variance was estimated in five participating centers by repeat MRI scanning of 12 healthy participants from whom distributions of gray matter were estimated. The effect on outcome measures when varying FDR and the proportion of true positives is presented. Their spatial patterns reflect within-center variance, which is consistent across centers. Sample sizes 3-6 times larger are needed when detecting effects in subcortical regions compared to the neocortex.

68724c18fc1f53a0955f006a1548da16acdc1b46,Empirical and Theoretical FDR Analyses for fMRI Data,"The multiple comparisons problems encountered in statistical analysis of functional neuroimaging data are well known. As an alternative to conservative methods for Family Wise Error Rate correction (e.g., Random Field Theory (RFT), Bonferonni tests), procedures that control the False Discovery Rate (FDR, Benjamini et al, 2004) have been proposed as alternatives (Genovese et al, 2002). While these procedures are usually described in terms of sorted p-values, they can also be described using the ratio of two distribution functions: one null and one ""observed"" from the data (Storey et al, 2004). The null distribution function is usually just the voxelwise null distribution of the statistical parametric map (SPM) (e.g., t with 10 degrees of freedom).",2005,,"list(name = ""Dara Ghahremani"", ids = ""2737401"")",,f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf,,,
f1590532291282a2d043b1c081860d144c90daef,Brain Functional Connectivity in Patients With Somatic Symptom Disorder,"Objective The aim of the study was to evaluate whether individuals with somatic symptom disorder (SSD) display increased resting-state functional connectivity (FC) within and between the sensorimotor network (SMN), default mode network (DMN), salience network, and dorsal attention network (DAN). Methods Eighteen patients with SSD and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We used a seed-based correlation approach for the four brain networks. Results Patients with SSD had higher scores on the Somato-Sensory Amplification Scale (z = 5.22, p < .001) and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised-Somatization (z = 4.94, p < .001) and greater FC within the SMN, DMN, and salience network than healthy control participants. Patients with SSD also had increased FC between the SMN and DMN, SMN and salience network, SMN and DAN, and salience network and DAN (t = 5.10â€“7.47, all false discovery rate q < .05). The Somato-Sensory Amplification Scale scores correlated with FC between the SMN and salience network and between the SMN and DAN (r = .61â€“.82, all p < .003). Conclusions Based on the results of the FC analysis between the SMN and salience network, we suggest that SSD may be associated with alterations of sensory-discriminative processing of pain and other somatic symptoms, which is influenced by affective processing. Based on the results of the FC analysis of the SMN and DAN, we suggest that patients with SSD have a deficit in attention, leading to misperception of external stimuli and failure to regulate bodily functions aimed at interactions with external stimuli.",2019,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Sun Mi Kim"", ids = ""46876784""); list(name = ""Ji Sun Hong"", ids = ""7545962""); list(name = ""Kyoung Joon Min"", ids = ""11800695""); list(name = ""Doug Hyun Han"", ids = ""18554383"")",8fb8701a82a3d8170fddde249500d96aeb1c0f20,b38a6ee957f3ce59a88e21d93d8f3e82d6da7909; 288d043098e8745323ee20d0838a0f9e3d67c824; e4a8e5728eb1c1323a01f3f14128fd12ea4380c3; cf23e3300c02cc1f51f68397697b79be00784c4a; 53ba2d31c60b94d82c2929c5e2573629303ce498; 5022023be3d425bc340fab8eea22c38b288e9155; e5d54bedcc3f8ac5970cb994add6dd90d5b35eef; c1a9e739b594abbf73a9ee3b25c3745cac70bdd0; db29eed2bd2a310a8ea848a1056805e2bbb1e754; c5c6640ede958ca27f8694d8e83464bcdc8f38fa; f377327b8c6e02ebc2908a7300cb6c9c3a38bebe; a7378049092a06fc408423396bbebd11db53af25; f4dfb03dea61cbb2e1db07472d7547abc1b6ec86; e734b5c283acc577a0d3237d989fbbef11344610; bca291da2e389484c66e733db7b0325455a74743; e6f451c8250286869295bbddd78aec8ed53fff4a; bb4ef92ad8b8c3eac9c0d3b9aeaafe3047912133; 00e1c10ff9d6d44c68b4a06a0abd15e05b30e051; 1559cf46c0e04ad5c6b84eb6f62a92f2af0c783a; 2407d360d752c93bf87319093a5f86dba2d4aeca; b5484924fe31d896266a01f8845e375ce4cc6a9f; 4a8b8d0818c352317c2a72581880d36e95fbd98e; b05c97327b3e99884e4879ee4430570d65cb4686; efe0294f9d4e10852de735c34949063355b9a934; 6814d976154b17e41bc79f8694e2372534e50419; 9e61c6c46956504fb76c7b87073402a4414d0928; 5d7e514d45141178fc1061bd18f1102d8318a8c3; 6c64889a707a15702f0abb047be5cd14d8a3dfb4; 78feffac85f1abf41b2dc464db9335eb59ed8bf9; 63a492eda69618d76cde1a1fd23b2b7df54b10e3; 038b6c1af702374ad29d2c6e75e363d8e34fadcc; a96d69b3b45d6893f287a2b91ad658606168599b; ab35c6eced55bdbe5419217e2dd46e71a85e16fe; 396c347c9518a784841aaf46b59eded1e0bdf366; 850e9f43a6a50ac5167044987fd4c919474e68d0; 5b126313c2b70a4236f72e99fa91f8d7cd778261; d4919556ee7f88dffdac94f9e4b9157995142b8f; b385dec050302784dd36f79e97422560b91a09ab; 1cb9a4f9dbcc90fdc3444288a4eae6025d4ab472; ca9100bd89dfce0588a094da40ce50b6bf9c1b8e; 111c6ae697e4af6564729e913af6b3ac187b3370; 165fd770b8893f8511852d44f4d4ac7241eebeeb; fbc803b97653309c670710362ccd5d0b134ec021; e62e9178ee780bb692c696aa3793e51144474b90; 8c28caad5c4286e4cde8a73703ad5bc00c199d84; e1f813c6841ccf8af1c155b9c886cc9da6899dec; df6356460cfc0c293eb63e06c653ae777c0ce272; dcadc8fc5bf5534c20824842d8719e33c4ee2640,Psychosomatic Medicine,81,313â€“318

Hepatitis A vaccination has dramatically reduced the incidence of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection, but new infections continue to occur. To identify human genetic variants conferring a risk for HAV infection among the three major racial/ethnic populations in the United States, we assessed associations between 67 genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) among 31 candidate genes and serologic evidence of prior HAV infection using a population-based, cross-sectional study of 6,779 participants, including 2,619 non-Hispanic whites, 2,095 non-Hispanic blacks, and 2,065 Mexican Americans enrolled in phase 2 (1991-1994) of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Among the three racial/ethnic groups, the number (weighted frequency) of seropositivity for antibody to HAV was 958 (24.9%), 802 (39.2%), and 1540 (71.5%), respectively. No significant associations with any of the 67 SNPs were observed among non-Hispanic whites or non-Hispanic blacks. In contrast, among Mexican Americans, variants in two genes were found to be associated with an increased risk of HAV infection: TGFB1 rs1800469 (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-1.68; P value adjusted for false discovery rate [FDR-P] = 0.017) and XRCC1 rs1799782 (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.27-1.94; FDR-P = 0.0007). A decreased risk was found with ABCB1 rs1045642 (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.71-0.89; FDR-P = 0.0007).


CONCLUSION
Genetic variants in ABCB1, TGFB1, and XRCC1 appear to be associated with susceptibility to HAV infection among Mexican Americans.

254ef424e76bf0d073664bb53a82cab4da7d5bd6,Genetic Variation in H 2 AFX Contributes to Risk of Non â€“ Hodgkin Lymphoma,"Nonâ€“Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) comprises a group of lymphoid tumors that have in common somatic translocations. H2AFX encodes a key histone involved in the detection of the DNA double-stranded breaks that can lead to translocations. H2afx is a dosage-dependent gene that protects against B-cell lymphomas in mice, making its human orthologue an ideal candidate gene for susceptibility to lymphoma. We did a population-based genetic association study of H2AFX variants in 487 NHL cases and 531 controls. Complete resequencing of the human H2AFX gene in 95 NHL cases was done to establish the spectrum of variation in affected individuals; this was followed by both direct and indirect tests for association at the level of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and as haplotypes. Homozygosity for the AA genotype of a SNP 417 bp upstream of the translational start of H2AFX is strongly associated [odds ratio (OR), 0.54; P = 0.001] with protection from NHL. We find a strong association of this SNP with the follicular lymphoma subtype of NHL (AA genotype: OR, 0.40; P = 0.004) and with mantle cell lymphoma (AA genotype: OR, 0.20; P = 0.01) that remains significant after adjustment for the false discovery rate, but not with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These data support the hypothesis that genetic variation in the H2AFX gene influences genetic susceptibility or resistance to some subtypes of NHL by contributing to the maintenance of genome stability.

Agricultural expansion will happen in regions that experience high ambient temperatures, where fast-growing commercial chickens are vulnerable. Indigenous chickens of such regions, due to generations of exposure to environmental challenges, might have higher thermal tolerance. In this study, two indigenous chicken ecotypes, from the hot and humid Mombasa (lowland) and the colder Naivasha (highland) regions, were used to investigate the effects of acute (5â€‰h, 35Â°C) and chronic (3â€‰days of 35Â°C for 8â€‰h/day) HS on the cardiac and skeletal muscle, through RNA sequencing. The rectal temperature gain and the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) [False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05] were two times higher in the acute stage than in the chronic stage in both ecotypes, suggesting that cyclic exposure to HS can lead to adaptation. A tissue- and stage-specific difference in response to HS was observed, with peroxisome proliferator-activated-receptor (PPAR) signaling and mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, enriched in heart and skeletal muscle, respectively, and the p53 pathway enriched only in the acute stage in both tissues. The acute and chronic stage DEGs were integrated by a region-specific gene coexpression network (GCN), and genes with the highest number of connections (hub genes) were identified. The hub genes in the lowland network were CCNB2, Crb2, CHST9, SESN1, and NR4A3, while COMMD4, TTC32, H1F0, ACYP1, and RPS28 were the hub genes in the highland network. Pathway analysis of genes in the GCN showed that p53 and PPAR signaling pathways were enriched in both low and highland networks, while MAPK signaling and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum were enriched only in the gene network of highland chickens.

f6887f4c1643400b3231dce05dc3c5aa938966ee,Urinary chromium is associated with changes in leukocyte miRNA expression in obese subjects,"Background/Objectives:Epidemiological studies suggest a link between chromium (Cr) status and cardiovascular disease. Increased urinary excretion of Cr was reported in subjects with diabetes compared with non-diabetic controls and those with non-diabetic insulin resistance. Epigenetic alterations have been linked to the presence of Cr, and microRNA (miRNA) expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). We investigated the association between Cr excretion and miRNA expression in leukocytes from obese subjects. We also examined the relationship between altered miRNA expression and selected clinical parameters to further investigate mechanisms linking Cr to metabolic diseases and CVDs.Subjects/Methods:We analyzed urinary Cr in 90 Italian subjects using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Peripheral blood miRNA levels were screened with TaqMan Low-Density Array Human MicroRNA A. Cr level-associated expression of miRNAs was detected with multivariate regression analyses, and the top 10 candidate miRNAs were selected for validation. We also used multivariate regression analyses to assess possible associations between validated miRNAs and glycated hemoglobin (A1c) and blood pressure (BP). The validated miRNAs were further investigated by functional analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software.Results:Urinary Cr levels (mean: 0.35â€‰Î¼g/l; s.d.=0.24) ranged from 0.05 to 1.27â€‰Î¼g/l. In the screening phase, 43 miRNAs were negatively associated with Cr. Of the top 10 miRNAs selected for validation, nine (miR-451, miR-301, miR-15b, miR-21, miR-26a, miR-362-3p, miR-182, miR-183 and miR-486-3p) were downregulated in association with Cr (P-false discovery rate (FDR)<0.10). miR-451 expression was associated with A1c (Î²=â€“0.06; P=0.0416), whereas miR-486-3p expression was associated both with diastolic (Î²=2.1; P=0.004) and systolic BP (Î²=3.3; P=0.003).Conclusions:These results indicate that miR-451 and miR-486-3p are involved in the link between Cr levels and metabolic diseases and CVDs.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Laura Dioni"", ids = ""50023311""); list(name = ""Salvatore Sucato"", ids = ""47493982""); list(name = ""Valentina Motta"", ids = ""49931392""); list(name = ""Silvia Iodice"", ids = ""48080431""); list(name = ""L.

2cc93ec461da8984da11fb21b48fde460be25d96,Empirical Bayes Interval Estimates that are Conditionally Equal to Unadjusted Confidence Intervals or to Default Prior Credibility Intervals,"Problems involving thousands of null hypotheses have been addressed by estimating the local false discovery rate (LFDR). A previous LFDR approach to reporting point and interval estimates of an effect-size parameter uses an estimate of the prior distribution of the parameter conditional on the alternative hypothesis. That estimated prior is often unreliable, and yet strongly influences the posterior intervals and point estimates, causing the posterior intervals to differ from fixed-parameter confidence intervals, even for arbitrarily small estimates of the LFDR. That influence of the estimated prior manifests the failure of the conditional posterior intervals, given the truth of the alternative hypothesis, to match the confidence intervals.Those problems are overcome by changing the posterior distribution conditional on the alternative hypothesis from a Bayesian posterior to a confidence posterior. Unlike the Bayesian posterior, the confidence posterior equates the posterior probability that the parameter lies in a fixed interval with the coverage rate of the coinciding confidence interval. The resulting confidence-Bayes hybrid posterior supplies interval and point estimates that shrink toward the null hypothesis value.The confidence intervals tend to be much shorter than their fixed-parameter counterparts, as illustrated with gene expression data. Simulations nonetheless confirm that the shrunken confidence intervals cover the parameter more frequently than stated. Generally applicable sufficient conditions for correct coverage are given.In addition to having those frequentist properties, the hybrid posterior can also be motivated from an objective Bayesian perspective by requiring coherence with some default prior conditional on the alternative hypothesis. That requirement generates a new class of approximate posteriors that supplement Bayes factors modified for improper priors and that dampen the influence of proper priors on the credibility intervals. While that class of posteriors intersects the class of confidence-Bayes posteriors, neither class is a subset of the other.In short, two first principles generate both classes of posteriors: a coherence principle and a relevance principle.

917d42dff11fb1464c7599029635ac543eb78e4b,False Discovery Rates in Identifying Functional DNA Motifs,"There are several methods for scoring a set of upstream DNA sequences against a given motif. Typically, significance of raw scores are based on p-values, measured by statistical hypothesis testing. As an extension, multiple hypothesis testing is adopted in cases where there are multiple motifs to be evaluated in parallel. In this way significant motifs are identified for a given significance level. However, a set of significantly identified motifs can contain false positives. In this work, we introduce a false discovery rate estimation problem for significantly predicted motifs. An explorative method for this problem is presented. We test the method using TRANSFAC and JASPAR motif libraries on several upstream DNA subsets of S.cerevisiae.

4baaca1f802891997190b5000b8ee6207d653f93,Gene expression profiling of laser microdissected airway smooth muscle tissue in asthma and atopy.,"BACKGROUND
Asthma and atopy share common characteristics including type 2 helper-T-cell-mediated inflammation. However, only asthma is associated with variable airways obstruction. The complex cellular and molecular pathways distinguishing asthma and atopy can now be captured by transcriptomic analysis (RNA-Seq). We hypothesized that the transcriptomic profile of airway smooth muscle (ASM) distinguishes atopic asthma from atopic healthy controls. First, we compared the ASM transcriptomic profiles of endobronchial biopsies between glucocorticoid-free, atopic asthma patients, and atopic and nonatopic healthy controls. Second, we investigated the association between ASM transcriptomic profiles and airway function.


METHODS
Twelve asthma patients and 12 control subjects (six atopic, six nonatopic) underwent bronchoscopy. RNA of laser-dissected ASM from 96 bronchial biopsy specimens was sequenced with Roche GS FLX. Gene networks were identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RNA-Seq reads were assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution. With the current sample size, the estimated false discovery rate was approximately 1%.


RESULTS
One hundred and seventy four ASM genes were differentially expressed between asthma patients and atopic controls, 108 between asthma patients and nonatopic controls, and 135 between atopic and nonatopic controls. A set of eight genes discriminated asthma patients from nonasthmatic controls, irrespective of atopy. Four of these genes (RPTOR, VANGL1, FAM129A, LEPREL1) were associated with airway hyper-responsiveness (PÂ <Â 0.05).


CONCLUSION
Airway smooth muscle from asthma patients can be distinguished from that of atopic and nonatopic control subjects by a specific gene expression profile, which is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ching Yong Yick"", ids = ""3718825""); list(name = ""Aeilko H.

Here, we propose a likelihood ratio test (LRT) based method and show, via an extensive simulation study, that the proposed method while retaining good power and sensitivity for identifying signals, controls both the Type I error and false discovery rates. The application of the LRT method to the AERS database is illustrated using two datasets; a small dataset consisting of suicidal behavior and mood change-related AE cases for the drug Montelukast, and a large dataset consisting of all possible AE cases reported to FDA during 2004â€“2008 for the drug Heparin.

0a7d461dd1e5cfe52554dcf09130cafa3756162d,Plasma extracellular RNA profiles in healthy and cancer patients,"Extracellular vesicles are selectively enriched in RNA that has potential as disease biomarkers. To systemically characterize circulating extracellular RNA (exRNA) profiles, we performed RNA sequencing analysis on plasma extracellular vesicles derived from 50 healthy individuals and 142 cancer patients. Of ~12.6 million raw reads for each individual, the number of mappable reads aligned to RNA references was ~5.4 million including miRNAs (~40.4%), piwiRNAs (~40.0%), pseudo-genes (~3.7%), lncRNAs (~2.4%), tRNAs (~2.1%), and mRNAs (~2.1%). By expression stability testing, we identified a set of miRNAs showing relatively consistent expression, which may serve as reference control for exRNA quantification. By performing multivariate analysis of covariance, we identified significant associations of these exRNAs with age, sex and different types of cancers. In particular, down-regulation of miR-125a-5p and miR-1343-3p showed an association with all cancer types tested (false discovery rate <0.05). We developed multivariate statistical models to predict cancer status with an area under the curve from 0.68 to 0.92 depending cancer type and staging. This is the largest RNA-seq study to date for profiling exRNA species, which has not only provided a baseline reference profile for circulating exRNA, but also revealed a set of RNA candidates for reference controls and disease biomarkers.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tiezheng Yuan"", ids = ""48579984""); list(name = ""Xiaoyi Huang"", ids = ""2732556""); list(name = ""Mark Woodcock"", ids = ""46926705""); list(name = ""Meijun Du"", ids = ""6149531""); list(name = ""Rachel L.

b4322c424849a14c3fa8375e52616bb35222a3f3,Automated Threshold Selection for Extreme Value Analysis via Goodness-of-Fit Tests with Application to Batched Return Level Mapping,"Threshold selection is a critical issue for extreme value analysis with threshold-based approaches. Under suitable conditions, exceedances over a high threshold have been shown to follow the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) asymptotically. In practice, however, the threshold must be chosen. If the chosen threshold is too low, the GPD approximation may not hold and bias can occur. If the threshold is chosen too high, reduced sample size increases the variance of parameter estimates. To process batch analyses, commonly used selection methods such as graphical diagnosis are subjective and cannot be automated, while computational methods may not be feasible. We propose to test a set of thresholds through the goodness-of-fit of the GPD for the exceedances, and select the lowest one, above which the data provides adequate fit to the GPD. Previous attempts in this setting are not valid due to the special feature that the multiple tests are done in an ordered fashion. We apply two recently available stopping rules that control the false discovery rate or familywise error rate to ordered goodness-of-fit tests to automate threshold selection. Various model specification tests such as the Cramer-von Mises, Anderson-Darling, Moran's, and a score test are investigated. The performance of the method is assessed in a large scale simulation study that mimics practical return level estimation. This procedure was repeated at hundreds of sites in the western US to generate return level maps of extreme precipitation.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Brian Bader"", ids = ""50739618""); list(name = ""Jun Yan"", ids = ""49781448""); list(name = ""Xuebin Zhang"", ids = ""46447522"")",,,arXiv: Methodology,,

Many genetic susceptibility loci are shared with other autoimmune or immune-mediated diseases that also cosegregate in families with T1D. The aim of this study was to investigate whether susceptibility loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of T1D were also associated with autoantibody positivity in individuals with diabetes. Fifty single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 6,556 multiethnic cases collected by the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC). These were tested for association with three islet autoantibodiesâ€”against autoantibodies to GAD (GADA), IA-2 (IA-2A), and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8A)â€”and autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPOA) in autoimmune thyroid disease, gastric parietal cells (PCA) in autoimmune gastritis, transglutaminase (TGA) in celiac disease, and 21-hydroxylase (21-OHA) in autoimmune hypoadrenalism. In addition to the MHC region, we identify SNPs in five susceptibility loci (IFIH1, PTPN22, SH2B3, BACH2, and CTLA4) as significantly associated with more than one autoantibody at a false discovery rate less than 5%. IFIH1/2q24 demonstrated the most unrestricted association, as significant association was demonstrated for PCA, TPOA, GADA, 21-OHA, and IA-2A. In addition, 11 loci were significantly associated with a single autoantibody.",2018,,"list(name = ""Orbit"", ids = ""89711938"")",1fa434e2200f97668650ba7f519518c1b3acd27d,,,,
931a574fea587b80a71e5f6a35dde278f0c138b4,Differential Expression of microRNAs in Severely Calcified Carotid Plaques.,"BACKGROUND
We investigated whether microRNA (miRNA) alteration is related to the presence of calcification in carotid plaques.


METHODS
We classified 10 plaques from carotid endarterectomy patients into high- and low-calcified plaques based on Agatston calcium scores. A microarray analysis for miRNA profiles was performed, with validation by a miRNA quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).


RESULTS
The miRNA microarray identified 697 probes; 657 of them were downregulated. We selected the genes that satisfied total gene signal (TGS) >50, |Log2 ratio|â€‰>â€‰1 and â‰¥1 of the following: (1) false discovery rate (FDR) <.05 in the comparison of mean values of logarithmic transformed signals between the groups; (2) .05â€‰â‰¤â€‰FDRâ€‰<â€‰.1 and showing either high or median for context score+ in miRSearch among the 72 carefully selected genes related to angiogenesis or calcification; and (3) FDRÂ <Â .1 in the comparison of 10 individual sets of high- and low-calcified plaques. The expression of miRNA validated by qRT-PCR revealed a significant downregulation of hsa-miR-4530, hsa-miR133b, and hsa-miR-1-3p. A Spearman's rank correlation analysis revealed that the logarithmic TGSs for the microarray of hsa-miR-4530 and hsa-miR-133b were significantly inversely correlated with the carotid plaques' calcium scores, and the delta Cq values for the qRT-PCR showed a direct association.


CONCLUSIONS
In high-calcified carotid plaques, a specific profile for miRNA may be identified, and the expressions of hsa-miR-4530 and hsa-miR-133b had inverse correlations with the calcium score in the plaques, suggesting that miRNAs may play a modulating role in calcified plaques and plaque stability.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hiroyuki Katano"", ids = ""34894791""); list(name = ""Yusuke Nishikawa"", ids = ""8989793""); list(name = ""Hiroshi Numazu Yamada"", ids = ""144302505""); list(name = ""Kazuo Yamada"", ids = ""50295940""); list(name = ""Mitsuhito Mase"", ids = ""32689166"")",4d4c96abd8eea122f7d690defc8da8077f10b808; 262f87ee35768888069be174b799265010e09df5; f765671f8e1b4574e0d9a6959123ce67c3b8344b,88c88432446ae310766b5345cb132a05bff51b5b; 54b17038788435366c478549bc3498b33c6da1db; 82d5bec96577bc11c21b8f4ee246f77c84024232; c8a1cec594f134dadfd81e762283c02040bd14ca; f3298215627cf291f22e6daf5436aec12f51570e; 4c55311b54db665526d966019400672a4f25c637; ef27773d152f6af4767e62521dc8485a36910ef7; 1e4c3dd6b098b4d898b8501b4ed5aa68aa53a6b1; 6ca7ac1ecde20b48749bdfba3cbaa02339e3a454; f90bc602434d53832b9523362b011e270796a890; cc6dccd76d9c5aa7b2a5a96cae46b25b2169dcbf; 27636c830ab9c45d38454d50312227747652f70e; 7f40505b54d8439c3e94dfeb5a91f32626a244a2; 75c5fb4a33f15a964dea2a2bdc24b514bc3c4072; b6f4651796eb621567fbe54c18c8c989ad49f935; 0442c89a09bfd5ba7f09340d0b23143f6c3f32b7; 42d91dd787d6235bd3400ada6cd3fc08f60e2fc2; 8907940d0bd606f12c61d380d82f74b907b0fd17; b0bcd73edbf35ef39769c6870fbf4c925374f5a1; 1786019c0b168f5080c05a86a269138244faf119; ec44fd14d67fce5d004c12df284445b0aec3f675; a6f98215b77caa3780052657a739ea67f3201242; 247c2132251b9a3efa5308bf74f3b7467bc9544c; daae26ac2afaad72aa28d13cc3c7edeaad4f63c0; 3b16bb2a40be127a5c024413fd1790fb476c43a8; fcf3bbaeca29a8d4e5c4137060f2e8a3bab4d65e,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,27 1,"
